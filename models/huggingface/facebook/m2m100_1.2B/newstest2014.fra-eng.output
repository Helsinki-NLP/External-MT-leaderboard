Spectacular "wingsuit" jump over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over the Colombian capital Bogota on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), he passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badgers had gathered to observe his feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair the depleted highway infrastructure, many are those who have an idea of a solution in the form of a small black box that’s fixed above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record every mile travelled by a driver and transmit information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices of planning to remake the outdated funding system for major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of major axis planning has suddenly provoked a heated debate and agitated alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups to pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you walk, and possibly the road you drive on, and then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about privacy protection.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles they have travelled.
Thousands of drivers have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is very important for our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, general director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts that the state will start recording the miles travelled by each California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracks on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this mileage usage cost.
It’s not surprising that the idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers paid by mile.
“It’s not just a tax plunging into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the way of paying the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would cover about 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, responding to concerns from rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or town.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country’s most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the state kilometre fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were worried that the government could follow their slightest deeds and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and things like this are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged localization devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, crowded technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily passages and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car runs, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes to states.
She sought to break into the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she tests liked big axis planners because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in pilot programs in some states.
There are far less expensive methods and far less intrusive methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport managers are seeking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide a “driving payment” insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,” said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate about paying by mile isn’t just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund bankruptcy by raising gasoline taxes.
A single or annual additional tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four unprecedented hits
The musician did not stop surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, which was released in January, he made up a luxury re-release scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished ones.
Four of them have already appeared on the Internet.
The announcement of a new album by David Bowie has left everyone in shock.
On his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still count on him to scintillate the pop scene.
A party for fans
Not surprisingly, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke are scheduled to re-release the album on November 4.
In the meantime, he planned a big party for his fans.
This re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, will come in the form of three albums: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie has presented this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and cover, a booklet to share his own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, most importantly, he gives a taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unknown people are listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like a Rocket Man, Born in a UFO are also available online.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing introduction before a bright riding that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born in a UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his weirdness: Would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie enjoys playing the cameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man on a rocket, potential martian...
He hides and reveals both, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is not surprising that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcasting from November 10.
Defense Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing wounded military personnel – who do not meet the military’s “universality of service” rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a range of varied tasks – to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases by The Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Caporal David Hawkins, a reserve officer from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after Caporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not comply with the rule of service universality.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can give wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year showed that of the 1,228 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, on Wednesday called for the reintegration of Caporal Hawkins, while neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney launches an animated series on tablets
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prefer tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children’s series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its global launch on the Disney group's channels is scheduled only in 2014, the Disney Junior division said in a statement.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, a sheriff of a western American town where she rules order with a magical lasso.
Each episode contains two stories of 11 minutes.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years old used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years old, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter he presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Al the outcome of my efforts has been obviously positive, my government continues to treat the dissent as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make sure that is possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to a severe test following complaints that the NSA had intercepted the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there is a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without putting him at risk and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Greens MP, posted a photo of him with Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a "serious and sustained" campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged that the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance is of public benefit.
The letter provides an offer for cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved.”
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers might well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the on-demand video service Netflix via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday it was currently conducting preliminary testing of the platform’s beta version with some of its users.
“This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” said Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus taking the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary has no precise date yet with regard to this new platform.
“You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their broadcast platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Throne Speech on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the option to pay for the services by card.
"It's been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages doesn't work," Audet said.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
“It will need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television,” Cogeco’s chief executive said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
In terms of earnings, Cogeco a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs associated with new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
It was the company’s first major acquisition after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also acquired Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
Cogeco’s revenue grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
That is $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenue increased by 45% to 470,4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers has increased to 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of customers fluctuate like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a trend change, he noted.
It varies from one quarter to the other with a very fierce competition.
Horses in beef products
Horse meat was detected in conserve boxes of beef products sold by two small British low-cost distribution brands, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA up to 1-5%.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredient list, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 p.m., a driver who was driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and struck a car coming in the other direction.
Both passengers were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement it said passengers could take the unopened can with them when the plane landed.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed underneath the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travellers only paid once at the boarding door.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
The airlines began paying for the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more space in those compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It is about making the most loyal customers of Frontier understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger in the queue at a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O’Malley explained that Frontier’s site and registration procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before they arrive at the door.
Frontier hand luggage charges will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often hesitate about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that the cost of handling luggage is significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of luggage fees to be a sign that airlines are paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Many of them did not pay for luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline that imposes such charges is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the charges as a supplement.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage costs amounted to $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines employee, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding door at a time when passengers would discover the unusual hand luggage charges imposed by the airline.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth scratching and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers boarded at lightning speed.”
Frontier also does like Spirit and applies a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened box with them, and those who drink coffee can be served for free.
They will be distributing water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to get paid for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge hand luggage fees when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to visit its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of turning to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half-mile loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mileage premiums by 25 percent on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown, Denver, but her business declines and she loses money.
Revenue dropped by 9 percent and its flight capacity dropped by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to repair Frontier’s finances by selling the airline.
NSA blames “internal error” and not hackers for failing its website
The National Security Agency operating in the shadow said Friday it was a bug that had caused its public website to break down for a few hours, and not hackers as some claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site crashes.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, once nicknamed the “No Such Agency,” has been blasted and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of disclosures about its extensive communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the disappointed former NSA consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let down its employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, individual employees were met to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” explains Felix Bisson, regional director of working relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of the Delta is involved in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have emerged in Montreal.
"Either he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holding the Transat Tourism Chair at the School of Management Sciences at UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become an elderly residence.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects with a total of 600 rooms will be completed within two years.
For Titan CEO, "Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the swamp in January for the partial re-acquisition of Goodyear’s Amiens-Nord plant promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire company Titan, today says he is ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, announced this on Monday.
After giving up on the plant purchase project in January, you are coming back today.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
I don’t understand that face.
Would you please Mr. Montgomery?
I am not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the highest-paid.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I’m sorry.
But France has a high level of taxes and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day while working eight hours in other countries disadvantages France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudice about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a fair price and skilled workers, it’s worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the factory closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good start allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let’s imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows this.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among Goodyear’s approximately 1,200 current employees.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
There will be no more workers in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide time guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier profits decline as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from falling aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Train division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not provided flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft, nor information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial launch schedule before next September.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter flew only three times, and then the question arose whether the test phase was on the right track.
The results did not meet expectations and the stock price fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, moving from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the stock market’s low rising potential in the next quarter or two quarters.
“Al the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a customer note.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177.It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight testing to validate the company’s claims regarding energy efficiency and savings potential of the new aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief executive officer, is confident that Bombardier will its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft comes into commercial service.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was progressing according to the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than planned,” Beaudoin said during a phone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s shutdown time.
Each manufacturer planned differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and set up an update period, and that’s what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the timetable for entry into service and will provide more information in the coming months.
“This slowness in flight testing – although it appears to be in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dropped slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aviation Division amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aviation revenue decreased by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said its revenue had increased by 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book of the Transport division totalled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The Transport Division’s margins suffered from execution problems with a few major contracts.
Leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The stock price of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc., would sit on the board of directors, fell from 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 were missing in an abyss under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, Spéléo secours de l'Isère learned on Friday.
They were localized this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one ready to practice and the other not, had left underground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We have not heard of them since then, the source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 o'clock in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, a technical adviser at Spéléo secours in charge of organizing the rescue.
Dozens of people on the spot
Around 20 rescuers, ten civilians members of the Spéléo secours français, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
In the late afternoon of Friday, the two speleologists were localized.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," Le Dauphiné said.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned on their footsteps while waiting for rescue, the prefecture said.
Refuelled, they should get out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists banned from Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists on Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo after new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists to avoid using search engines and messaging services from Google and Yahoo until a new order,” she said in a statement.
The Washington Post that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected massive amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, chairman of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
MEPs call on Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels’s plan to “relift” the brass stations in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Ministry of Public Works and Transport has launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of repairing 16 lighting pillars of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both to “increase security” and “the Brussels identity”.
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all Brussels lights, for an estimated cost of around one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "demission".
“Not content to foolishly spend the money of the Brussels in operations to relief the signage poles in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of flamandization of the Capital,” De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-manga-black taxis, she finally painted herself in yellow-blue-dark-black the pillars of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is no longer “difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels”.
The Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is time to stop the Trojan horse.
“As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels people!” concludes De Bock.
Port of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived at the scene shortly after 10 o’clock, and traffic on the national road was subsequently diverted.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Finistère Prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the manager of the porch.
It is the last of three ecotax porches in operation in the Finistère department, the other two have been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can purchase a headset, a charger or even a storage box.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fiber or an intra-auricular headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “attend” it.
There is no recipe, no way to break through the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at her watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the night table.
This is the smile of my father who accompanies me every day.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that’s what I thought the day I found her body empty, crisped on that hospital bed with rubbed linen.
Similarly, his funeral was a cold farewell focused around the thin glow of candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she had gone.
Gradually, by small day or night appearances, slightly shy, slightly erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thought which was believed to be mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and behold, I found her, full and whole.
This path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, “within and out,” he says.
It has always been told to me.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I loved him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I got hurt...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, lived in my body.
I looked at his hands, I looked at mine, I borrowed him my body.
It was never indiscriminate.
I could have had a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It took a long time and one day he left.
In the end, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said, what would they have thought, what would they have done?
I dream of them constantly, maybe not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it’s too late, only there’s always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes some dreams take me to the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I was supposed to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed I was waking up, I was rushing out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he smiled at me and was delighted that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my stomach.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I am delighted to share this shared memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip to Cuba with my family.
It is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in moments when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of becoming a master of it in a large school, were not, with the retreat, an unnecessary choice.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades – before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I occasionally think about how she would like me to act at a given moment.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and righteousness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died 19 years ago.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I’ve gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that start on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then the time eased the pain.
There was only the lack, this void without answer, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the hole of her sweetness.
Still, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning I see his worried eyes standing upon me, I see the blinds that weaken his gaze, the ridges around his lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark his forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother has taken possession of my face and she looks at me in my mirror every morning.
Every morning I turn my eyes.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We are constantly feeling his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer a taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the darkness of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the moral is a bit reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the time goes back makes us realize how she was an orchestral leader and we try to stay on the path she has traced us.
If a person has loved you very much, his absence cannot take it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or appreciated.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his view of things.
I have had problems in my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it’s impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don’t sleep with it and I’m always wondering what he will think about it.
I don’t know if I’ve adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
It will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Soon it’s been 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has naturally eased, but he is still close to me.
Very often he "lands" in my dreams in such a precise, so vivid way that when I wake up I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he replied, “I’m going down” but with a voice so real that I woke up in a jump, anxious, and I lighted the bedlight looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I turn around to see if he’s not there, I know it’s him and I talk to him.
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or her spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have plenty of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki is seeking help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” al-Maliki said in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and urging the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Coca-Cola lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool court.
A great defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after compromising his habit of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "primary case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police interrogation operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted 32-year-old Sarborough laying three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, as he attended a Bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and on her credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other men, they were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Court of Appeals, Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being found guilty of two heads of obstruction charges after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine in a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf gloves.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the home of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and they called each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and on her credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied consuming cocaine.He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a “legal privilege.”
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he said he owned an office at his home as well as at his workplace and that it happens that clients call him home for legal issues.
But the court heard testimony that it was calling on major drug traffickers, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If someone needs to know that you shouldn’t break the law, he’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with individual clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing the drug to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But that went well beyond the usual boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered police investigation as much as he could to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor her profession, but dishonored her.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal behavior and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself as he began to obtain drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction endangered him forever and made him vulnerable to the backminds of leading members of organized criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the lacquer of his profession.
The Lancashire Crime and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three heads of charges of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting the criminals.
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta held a question/answer session about himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what motivates him to work.
Aretha Franklin to return to stage in December

Ms. Franklin was involved in the November recording of an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she suffered from, the famous Respect interpreter had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seafront covered with a light coat: one could cheer the warm-up in Menton with the lighting bill.
In contrast to many municipalities, this is paid by the taxpayers, not by trade associations.
In order to reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Passengers and staff rushed to the exits or to the tarmac.
Police soon intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical Songs for Teenagers
Each time, it will be the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had seen a lot of success during the previous season.
Through five saynette imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a strong dose of humor, we allow teenagers to deprive the classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyrical Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes full room for the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Lyrical Apéro, the concert-benefit held last August, with the contribution of the colorature soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a profit-to-profit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The Mouse.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press conference held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the uncertainty that is the fate of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Finances are on the run and we hope to last until the opera's 50th anniversary, a step that we will make in seven years," the administrator said.
“I would even say beyond,” added CEO Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who held a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey is facing six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, seizure, threatening, wearing weapons for a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The swift reactions of the police involved and their ability to disrupt the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," Caporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will face trial on Friday.
Appeal against the Sainte-Croix Brothers
A new collective appeal has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, regarding sexual assaults that were alleged to have taken place this time at the St. Joseph’s Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J." who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher brother the Submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he served as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal targeted only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us, "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
Currently, the appeal gathers the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal emphasizes that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exerted a moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuses perpetrated and nevertheless drowned them", and that they "scientifically and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latest charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers’ lawyer, Mr. Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Higher Court.
Once admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second phase, i.e. the hearing on the merits, proceeds.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of St. Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearing was conducted on the subject matter.
Large fire in a store
A fire severely damaged a store in Montreal's LaSalle district in the night of Thursday to Friday.
Emergency services were called around 1 a.m. on Friday because of a fire in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived at the scene.
No one was injured, but twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
Many opposition to medical aid to die at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of Palliative Care, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Network of Palliative Care of Quebec also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she regrets.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Palliative Care Houses vice president Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also the director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
Rick Firth, director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, believes that the Quebec bill confuses the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the step.
For his part, the liberal deputy of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end-of-life will need to be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Kenya press outrages controversial media law
“This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and asking it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent news stations and websites.
He said the new media court “will always be partial because it’s an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,” he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “the control over the media.”The Standard, on the other hand, said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had suffered a hard blow” and blamed the bill, calling it “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of an attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping center last September.
Kenya's media sparked the authorities' anger by broadcasting images of surveillance cameras in which troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the call was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media may be fined up to 20 million shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “deleted” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of a offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
“Nobody will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of control in public life.
“Rendered to themselves, the politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and harvesting.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their mirroring salaries of approximately 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A tough year for pharmacists
The departure of 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir in the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, in the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmacy department has found itself severely lacking in personnel.
Nearly 30% of the necessary personnel were lacking, making this financial year "very difficult", according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire self-employed workers, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use the troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
We have streamlined or decreased some of our activities within the establishment to lighten, as things go back.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in the pharmacy] to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this tough period, the year 2013-2014 is expected to be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain have been fruitful, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it is much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill up last year’s departure.
Increasing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it’s okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don’t have pharmacists available to make replacement, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start her career in the cinema from the small door.
Director Lars von Trier has chosen her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama revolves, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (1st and 8th January 2014), the erotic memories of a four-year-old sex addict since her adolescence.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin to her elderly is striking: a silhouette of toast, a diaphane tint and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulfuric situations on the big screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to professionals of the X for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing his actresses into their final clips, always for the best.
Stacy Martin did not stop talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tingling in the throat felt by viewers.
Immediately, the director of the establishment evacuated the room and alerted the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
People were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
A bad joke on the backdrop of lacrymogenic jet?
Or an unintentional incident?
It is still that the film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was airy and everything was in order.
The cinema has regained its rights and customers have regained the pleasure of the images.
Only on screen.
She tried to import 2 kg of cocaine in garlic
Taking advantage of the Halloween day, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine hidden in strawberries into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger’s luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine was divided into three cakes that had previously been empty.
The drug was then transported to the Office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (GRC), which took over the investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, an ASFC spokeswoman.
What I can tell you is that it came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border guards at Montreal-Trudeau airport have seized 173 drugs, including 10 cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border guards in the Quebec region seized a total of 1,653 drugs.
Air strikes on military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese military, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles had been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of the Tsahal air force on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in almost identical circumstances to that of July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous U.S. official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation over seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country’s public debt rating goes to “B-”, falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," the agency said.
The agency notes that the foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of loans taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers an increasingly likely devaluation, which would swell its external debt.
Kiev is also in need of cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay a bill of $882 million.
The announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public a day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country’s economy had experienced its fifth quarter in a row of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, up from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has for months sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 granted it a loan of $15.3 billion and has so far unlocked only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new payment until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" were "a vulnerability" while showing "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Center for Political Studies, “you can’t expect a short-term improvement.”
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the president's election is scheduled for 2015, the expert said.
The only hope is an improvement in the global economy.
S&P also highlighted the “uncertainty” related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditioned on the release of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” S&P said, fearing “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. government approves Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objections from U.S. authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups announced in a statement.
They said they also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the review period provided by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the necessary conditions for the transaction to be carried out.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups," they add.
Congolese army attacks M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of being defeated after being driven out of locations in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which it had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
“We will pursue the M23 and accumulate it wherever it hides because they are criminals,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a FARDC spokesman, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have martyred the Congolese people for too long.
It is time to bring peace back.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel’s political leader, told RFI that the military reversal would not change his claims to peace talks.
These, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last rebel-held locality to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison’s escape and the passivity of the Monusco Blue Helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world’s largest in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC headquarters was rearranged and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops today is unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” predicts Congo affairs expert Jason Stearns on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government managed to beat a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts have accused Rwanda, which denies it, of military support for the M23, a group of former Congolese militants.
British Foreign Minister William Hague has called on Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali spoke of the possibility of military retaliation following the shelling dropped on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us that we would one day be liberated by the army," said a resident of the locality bordering Uganda.
“We lived in the terror (of the M23), we are traumatized,” he added.
The tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, the Ministry of Health said.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two cases confirmed in France so far.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas output increased while remaining in retreat from the group’s targets.
Its net profit in the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast an average profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpd this year, with a 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditure increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Production profits decreased slightly in the third quarter, while downstream profits (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, a declining net profit on Thursday, despite the rise in its oil and gas production.
Student transport: the complaint deemed admissible
From the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke School Commission (CSRS) charges $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
“There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested,” Ms. Lefèvre explains.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediate and asked for an additional time to consider it.
“It’s always better to talk about it, to negotiate and find solutions,” Lefèvre said.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process when filing a complaint.
Imbroglio around the emergency closure of the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the rush carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the closing date of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "to not run any risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which was also aimed at not hindering the campaign of the PS a few months from municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on this date.
Even if, in APHP, we prefer to use the term “transformation” or “change in continuity”.
As of November 4, firefighters – who were responsible for about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passes to the emergencies of the Hotel-Dieu – will all have been instructed to take thirty serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals.
This date corresponds also to the renewal of the internships.
At the Hotel-Dieu, the emergency specialists will leave room for five general medicine internships on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," assures Loïc Capron, the chairman of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, who supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical head of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he tempered, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the spot to transfer serious cases.
Emergency doctors will remain on the spot, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency service.
“Things are being done gradually,” said Nicolas Péju, a spokesman for the ARS for whom, on November 4, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
“The minister has lied to us or has been lied to her,” regrets emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Removed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the campaign against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warner" in the face of a "cyclical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly swallowed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière emergencies.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not at risk of representing a "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will otherwise have been strengthened.
The ARS and APHP are defending the “new hospital model” already in place since October 7 and is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal general doctors should also come to participate in the establishment of a "permanent outpatient care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will be the same as in maternity classes.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again reminded on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark its clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, its spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy in the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of transfer to other hospitals.
Obama Ends Listening to International Monetary Fund and World Bank
President Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its surveillance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA surveillance case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the intelligence agency has mentioned the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official replied: “The U.S. does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington.”
Speaking under the guise of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had ordered an end to these practices in recent weeks.
This instruction was given roughly at the same time that ended the listening at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
United Nations welcomes new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations is now working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in bringing forward the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the SDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began yesterday in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final preliminary draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was time to “overcome national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to set universal sustainable development goals,” he added.
These SDGs will be based on progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfill the mandate I have been entrusted by the Member States to our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the success of the SDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique increase as conflicts break out between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, whispering them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to sing peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her working clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by the white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investments over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other’s responsibility for tensions.
Renamo says the government is at the source of recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the Sofala province, a traditional Renamo bastion, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo responsible for triggering the conflict, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who wants to use "all his remaining forces to try to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concerns grew after Mazanga said Renamo was leaving the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don’t stop fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, a speaker at the Open University and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to get more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it carried out disturbing lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the collisions took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where is Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has intensified the frustration of the government, said Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it’s up to them to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “life style models,” the author says.
Thor’s Legend may show that “brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning,” while Arthur’s legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too violent, too scandalous, and in some cases, too obscene to be taught in school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of works suitable for the age.
“I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been supporting this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “completely discarded”, messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Per the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or ended well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza said.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they wiped out a gunshot from an Israeli armor.
NSA spying: U.S. has "goed too far," Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged in this first confession of Washington in the midst of controversy with Europe about the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandals, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in NSA intercepting communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I admit to you, as the president did, some of these actions went too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future,” Kerry said at a conference in London he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy long justified intelligence and intelligence-gathering practices with the necessary anti-terrorist struggle and prevention against possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of September 11, 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since defeated numerous attacks by intercepting communications and gathering intelligence.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling down, buildings from exploding and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware in advance of these projects," he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," he added, who had already spoken about the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured on Thursday evening that President Obama was “resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels deceived.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says that the program dubbed "MUSCULAR", and carried out with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the fiber optics used by the internet giants.
According to one of the documents, about 181 million items had been collected in January alone – ranging from metadata in emails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside of the United States.
Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to this.
In the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and as leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was unaware of such interceptions, Barack Obama refused to comment on this, citing national security.
The head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services who allegedly seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also aroused China’s anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, the championship leader in front of Monaco at the difference of goals, broadcasted the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of his left knee when he returned from the selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the deceased
The crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the mayor of Paris, will attend, and will then explain, during a press conference, her proposals in matters of funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they are unlucky about losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also “symbolic violence”, which is the “deletion of singularity and distinctive signs” reduced to the “anonymity” of the ashes.
Why is what is hardly accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to deprive it.
To privatize the cremation is to François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the funeral services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to organizing the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civilian (24%).
Now, 73% of people who chose cremation would like a ceremony to be held.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to prevent the violence of a wait, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the removal of the ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of establishments now offer ceremonial masters, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him with others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize a farewell.
This has been the case at Père Lachaise’s crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also some Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, on La Toussaint Day, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation due to rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the director of the office Terres du Sud Habitat, proposed, in an exceptional and provisional way, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in towns.
The deratisation company carries out two passes a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last year, there have been 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to be abandoned, and the rats don’t roll in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, you will not kill a boy.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," says the family father who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon without the penny and expect a new home, at the same price as the old one.
Tokyo stock exchange ends down 0.88%
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quotation suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14.201,57 and the Topix ceded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1.183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11 percent to 1,668 yen.
House in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday at noon in Vieux-Québec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were deployed to the 9th of Rue Hébert.
The fires broke out in a house of three apartments on four floors located behind the courtyard of the Seminaire of Quebec.
All residents were absent at the time of the fire.
The fire was put under control about an hour after firefighters arrived.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's buildings glued here," said France Loiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find out the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, Vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of ceremonial master at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has been perpetuated over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and major theatres.
“Most of the poster heads emerged at the Carolines, and had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue to work with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the actors attending this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, featuring shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front stage in a cable sitcom (“The League” on the FXX channel’s joyfully lax fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was part of the cast of Parks and Recreation, but she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young actors with a singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hotel in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said to himself, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I will come to live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and close to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that China’s electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supply increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to tighten after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline not seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108,58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Law on abortion in Texas
A federal appeal court has restored in Texas some restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a first-instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a bill passed in July in that state that largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The appeal court’s ruling means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have to have a “admission privilege” at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a caring member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center in order to deliver a diagnosis or treatment there.
Abortion advocates argue that the content of the law could result in the immediate closure of one-third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these establishments.
On Monday, a judge of first instance ruled on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first-instance ruling that blocked the law's enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The Nouvelle Star has managed to regain an audience strength, with 1.3 million viewers behind their television station, or 5.6% of the audience.
Was the show at the meeting?
Around 10,000 candidates appeared at the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
Why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored at this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows bring a wide selection of singers in the grass, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes have even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others have the ambition to laugh.
The Court Blocked a Decision on NYPD’s Control and Examination Policy
A federal appeal court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes in the New York police department's inspection and search program and dismissed it from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) stated that judge Shira Scheindlin’s decision was suspended until the city’s appeal ended.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed on its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign an inspector to help the police department change its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments regarding the suspension request on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she violated the judges’ code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and supervision reform, and has ordered a pilot program to test body cameras in neighborhoods where the most checks take place.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal filed by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and excavation have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and excavation has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level in 2011 with 684,330 checks involving mostly black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was initiated in 2004 by four men, all of whom came from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Supporters of changes in the NYPD’s inspection and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more efficient and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, represent a waste of money, and do not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it was not ending the control and excavation practices, which are constitutional, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each home.
We are forced to increase rent to help us pay the new taxes.
When we vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay $100,000 for fireworks, $4 to $5 million for land in case of fireworks.
Go vote, it’s the best way to express yourself and say it’s enough.
End of service for the Elysée chef
Entered the 500 m2 of the Elysée cuisine as committed after working in embassies, the chef climbed every ladder until becoming a chef, nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande through Nicolas Sarkozy, including in their vacation venues, and has nourished an incalculable number of great men of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, disguised skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in La Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the owner of a pastry chief.
His mother was a cook at a castle in Sologne.
"I've gone from one castle to another!" ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women from the Kitchen of the Elysee!
Not pleased with heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all gourmets," gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had “a slightly more developed appetite.”
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who has restored cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who has recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of the Elysée, who drank a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, family and friends, left with a bit of heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
“His human side has come out,” he says.
He will be replaced by his deputy, 35-year-old Guillaume Gomez, who has been at the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was plagued by fires in Vieux-Québec on Friday noon.
The four-room building, located on 15th of Rue Hébert, was the subject of three alarms from the fire service.
The fire broke out on the front, but spread to the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Fire Protection Service of Quebec, said the rapid intervention of firefighters prevented the spread of the flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
Four houses were housed in the house, but no tenants were there at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, although the damage was caused by the water.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis as a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves a few images out of his next film, including the title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will take you into his role as a trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island Stock Exchange broker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast Wall Street corruption case.”
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then sets up a scam that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible rise, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in all sorts are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
The movie lasts at 2:45.
On December 25, he will be able to compete in the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a dumb pipe on a link involving then-executive Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “beautiful special adviser.”
It was to the court that the newspaper ordered Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby’s voice box and “permanently plant in front of her door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man who stays in front of people’s houses hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present history to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three means to investigate the subjects: telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Are you aware of telephone piracy?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course yes.”
The rumors of a relationship involving Clarke were first taken up by NotW’s editorial office when a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she was told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective’s computer involving Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a “Projects” file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Mrs. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms. Pawlby’s slightest deeds and gestures.
In a voice message he left to him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to tell Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson’s involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in the wake of violence
The President of the United States was scheduled to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the worst wave of violence in five years.
Iraq saw its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people were killed in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were wounded.
The United Nations says the number is even higher, with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence is becoming increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nuri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence fears a new escalation as neighboring Syria is plagued by a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the middle of the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five trapped cars north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunnite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri al-Maliki wants a “global war” against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the heart of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be welcomed by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in the country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive and congressional elected.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to lead a “third world war” against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his “sectarian and authoritarian policy.”
They also demanded that Barack Obama make clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing Accuses Uighur Group of Tiananmen Attack
China's head of domestic security on Friday accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car-trapped attack that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, crashed into the crowd on the famous Chinese capital square, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of domestic security issues, accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that occur there, driven by independentist demands.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, whose remarks were taken by the New China news agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained tanks filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests take care of gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds.
The poll was sent in mid-October to each national bishop's conference, with the instruction to obtain as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important family gathering that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the poll on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks rebel fifth
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were cut off at 2,000 meters above the hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
"It has not ceased since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, who was called by telephone around 12:30 a.m. and said a girl was wounded by bullet in the morning.
“The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit,” he added, “it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a bit.”
According to this witness, wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "ratish operation".
It was heard very clearly behind him cries feeding with light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political feudal and last strong spot of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP reporter could hear heavy weapons detonate.
According to a source at the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the fighting has entered "a final phase" as the FARDC has "enclosed the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them."
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive intelligence, observation and planning support.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were heading towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, military personnel assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to ensure the relief of another device piling the positions of the M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, on Wednesday night once again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" on penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left the process of Kampala open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without a result for now.
The M23 leaders are hoping to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a riot in April 2012 by former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 following a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa have regularly accused Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala have denied.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement to return to the DRC that started in the morning turned around midday.
"This morning we crossed back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back, told AFP.
The shootings are getting closer to the people.
Early in the evening, dozens of inhabitants were crossing the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of the stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the singing and dancing productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s rock opera, most of the attempts stumbled into ridicule.
And successes such as Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the auréole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage-Entertainment in Mogador has changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as successful tubes.
The first one takes on, this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the worldwide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the hits of the season.
On the other stages, musical shows such as “1789”, “The Lovers of the Bastille” and small musical comedies such as “Disco” or “Life and Times” stand out for success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Châtelet Theatre, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do French musicals evolve?
The supply has multiplied.
First, there are the “musical shows” that evolve at the will of the producers.
Some use beautiful projection images and a real story like in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump 15 years back on the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the poster.
Then there are the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage ­Entertainment popularizes varied Anglo-Saxon musical comedies by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as “Rent”, “The Kiss of the Spider Woman” or “The Awakening of Spring” have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing like on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The number of talents is as important as the number of positions to be provided.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it’s often the boulevard theatre for adults, not young adults.
Music shows fill this deficiency.
They are the same young people who love reality and what it produces as temporary stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) to head the poster of a musical show is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are skillfullyined by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a province Zenith.
Mayonnaise was grown in Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all major halls in France in the same form as in Paris.
One seriously injured in accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning around 5:30 p.m. on the Brussels inner ring at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver’s car was struck by a ghost driver, who is ill.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9 a.m., at the accident site, the time that the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause traffic jams because the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
Child injured in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at Disneyland Paris.
His prognosis is no longer confirmed but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until new order.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children play on a carbonized armor that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to remove the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
Only the hill of Runyonyi remains.
“Chanzu is not very strategic,” said the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Paluku is scheduled to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was captured by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been cut off at almost 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was wounded by bullet, and three others were wounded, one of them seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, the witness added.
Since the resumption of fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two sides have given no record of casualties.
NSA Revelations Increase Business Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of interceptor antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, insisted again in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal industrial secrets from foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became the whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on the word.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made transparent the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and.
I think it is possible that these data are used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German IT-sector SMEs.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all documents disclosed by Snowden, there is no indication so far that the United States has passed industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German MP says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them.
“That’s not the right way to do it,” said Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the industry.
Nevertheless, the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock for some companies who previously thought that China posed the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members have given up their plans to use a US cloud storage provider after the revelations about the U.S. data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is no surprise that there is economic espionage.
There has always been.
“It’s been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, a chemical company.
Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our.
Business executives are generally reluctant to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long cracked the message that it is at least reckless to pick up a free USB key at a business lounge or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the automotive manufacturer Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk of compromising the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are global leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warns in a report.
The United States is warning its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as second-degree culprits for carrying out acts of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died under unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
Parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found on a rolled fighting carpet in his high school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a carpet on January 11, standing behind the stairs of his high school gym.
Investigators at the Lowndes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a sign and they gave him back in a mortar bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he reveals evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff’s office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance recordings that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video images would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on children's allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies in school.
This is the first series of guidelines the U.S. government has issued, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States currently suffer from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
He also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the most commonly used EpiPen brand autoinjector – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state legislative assemblies recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something is stabbing my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have a biting on my tongue.”
NSA Case Underlines Total Absence of Intelligence Debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand publicly offends itself by summoning the U.S. ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the flight over the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Francois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World at a few weeks interval on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other a condemnation of the NSA’s listening to Quai d’Orsay?
Wouldn’t it be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by U.S. diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the U.S. power, this constitutes an important illumination.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to indignate us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA about terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Is it possible to exclude American cooperation?
The implementation for roughly ten years of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah was to the French through the NSA.
France may, for example, be forced to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return – it has already been said quickly – Americans can give French information on other parts of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the complete absence of prior debate, within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements on freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a deterioration of its image?
Even if they are denounced, I don’t see how they can be punished.
The risk taken by the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have become tense.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are refusing, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and therefore to the NSA.
The vast disclosure movement engaged by media around the world, which contributes to sparking a debate about nonexistent intelligence surveillance practices, could push lawmakers, including U.S., to reconsider the powers they have given their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “undetermined gender”
Germany became the first European country to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitals.
The male or female sex of the newborns shall no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child’s gender, allowing them to enter an “undetermined” or “unspecified” gender on their birth certificate.
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, confounded and scratched.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it’s best to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and monitor the child’s psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but that’s not the case with most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It is like the mystery surrounding homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to gender but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-driven crimes.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have camps that are specifically designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her trial in an appeal that allowed her to keep a “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown.”
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a gender to be assigned to babies at birth.
“Role as a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And only a decade ago, the medical community considered gender as a spark, which can be erased and on which it can be redesigned.
But from now on, there are many who question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, they did not call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be defamatory.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it can be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as “John/Joan,” his theories sparked controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a flattered circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raise him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At about the age of 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say “[that] they are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really say if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the outer organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn’t happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered scared him.
I was sterilized at birth – and nobody had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to grow.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, chief executive of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears the German law “invites to labelling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘undetermined’ gender,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said his organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law relates to the attribution of gender at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead at this age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammography radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law would “responsible” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now aged 29, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or caring mothers.
“The law leaves a certain breadth to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time before entering “male” or “female”.
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something awesome.
This allows the child to make the decision for themselves.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will last until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office approaches.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "strong intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former chairman of the Council convicted for tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi has threatened to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his removal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the Peoples of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to yield to the orders of Berlusconi, who already wanted to overthrow the cabinet.
The L.A. Times that an officer from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting.
Firefighters called to the scene said they responded to a call saying there were “multiple injured.”
"The law enforcement forces are on the spot," the airport said on its Twitter account, while television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed one person being evacuated on a wheelchair, and another being transported on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 local (12:30 in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also specified.
The Los Angeles Times that terminal 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to immediately confirm whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tanks fired on Thursday killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist and wounded another in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to health services sources.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the region as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli military has merely referred to a “targeted action” in the area near a tunnel called “terrorist” by the Jewish state, excavated at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have considered, in the greatest secret, to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in the long-awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and said Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out "deep group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's removal could help Obama for his re-election as his hopes were diminishing.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House secretary-general Bill Daley, aiming to measure what effect the replacement of vice president by former secretary of state Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been harshly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisors — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was being considered.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the office to replace Biden, despite their “strict personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “does not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the review “coordinated,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the vote.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin told CNN he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible change.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” was not a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama did not know that Biden’s removal from the presidential list was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want an ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first fluorescent ice based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on meduses and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat in the mouth, the more you lick, the more it becomes shiny.
Charlie, the founder of the “Lick Me I’m Delicious” ice cream company, said: “It’s something incredible, but we’re just at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 grams of this stuff costs around £200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts shining.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween as it gives an extraordinary bright effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve created because the luminescence of the meduses is worth four times more than gold.
Each ball costs me about £140.
But she has pretty good taste!
Charlie’s experimental approach company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible due to the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and addressed to the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his musician’s hands sprinkling the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer’s wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had," she added.
Lou Reed suffered a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: in figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and disguise to go to the neighborhood.
I have become more pessimistic today.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will not do it again this year.
But the statistics show that I am the wild sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I’m looking forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
The costumes are expected to amount to $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the uninhabited sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the space men of Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I think it’s hard to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
There are many dogs disguised as hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we do not glandulate.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sockets, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go on candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, let’s not tell stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candies are the only thing you don’t want to eat; and yet 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those stunning photos of you pissing on that your friends put on Facebook that you can’t remove and on which a guy you like leaves a “beautiful head” style comment.
Finally, let’s talk about cakes.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Chili when we were children, and carving a lantern-shaped chili is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were a kid.
Fortunately for us, the “baby cider trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted those potatoes and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on strawberries, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The candlesticks that slowly fold onto the porch of your home were probably from Illinois, where 542 million candlesticks were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticeable, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922-pound oak.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal “bad bank” structure comprising £38 billion ($45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure aimed at relaxing its relations with London and accelerating its re-privatization.
The bank wants to reduce the share of suspicious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to clear it completely within three years.
RBS also said it would register an additional four to 4.5 billion pounds of depreciation for dubious claims over the quarter, a writing linked to the constitution of the cantonal structure.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release £10 to £11 billion of capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a trait back in the past, the government being accused in particular of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer base and for the UK,” said new CEO Ross McEwan.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features seats and 6-point armor belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, chief executive officer of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Rally enthusiasts who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer this approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and prepare for the rigors and realities of raids.
We’ve had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after staying stuck 15 meters above the ground on an unstable corniche in a cage
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a car accident without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a man who was walking her dog trapped in the carriage.
Firefighters came down along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after firefighters were called to recover it safely while it was laid 15 meters above the ground on the unstable rise of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's carrier in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost puppy and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following an unsevere accident.
Around 14:15 on Wednesday, a person with sharp sight who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in the loop, trapped 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Corps rushed to the scene and came down as a recall to rescue Ruby using an animal cave to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely didn’t move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she is well now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It was incredible that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was lucky enough to get out of it safely.”
He could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her overall condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue workers.”
At first I didn’t think she was up there.
I was surprised to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were awesome.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can’t believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was choreographer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “he loved me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger representative said he “catastrophically denies having made any advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, hit the top of the charts this week.
Beijing Accuses Turkmen Islamic Movement
"The backstory support for the attack came from the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the head of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization since Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominant Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, drove their car loaded with gasoline bottles toward the entrance of the forbidden city in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and wounded 40 people.
The driver, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, formerly the name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
This movement is often designated by Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing history of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed threads along Hadrian’s wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and it was to be foreseen).
No one has said either that EU member states spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a tiny concession that Brussels could offer in exchange for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I first heard the nonsense that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
However, one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is finally at a dead end.
With the crisis of the euro, the Project Europe is officially dead.
Thro Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and removed the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many to think that the Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has imposed on its members favorable exchange rates for German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Southern Europe are facing an inherent productivity problem with Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is deeper productivity unrest in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas than the United States.
This is a redhibitory disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage freezes won’t prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, the revolt crumbled, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the troubled French economy to disappear.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists in power back to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot rely on the principle that a split from the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white working class?
She wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-European anti-currency bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very likely, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will more resemble the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” freely favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the UK to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will make the eyes gentle in the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending around Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and is to be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling, and the Conservatives/Liberal Democrats coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Ageing Early
Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start to grow at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – generally, this doesn’t indicate a rapid progression to full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as swollen breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared to 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has begun to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first periods appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster progression may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature ageing of bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their periods.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and upset by being the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 that linked the percentage of fat mass to the trigger of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger hair on the face and in the pubic area, the tendency towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
A tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that had just begun to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinémathèque, won the Golden Palm at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their turn on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs are played live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich cast in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less glossy clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jury charged the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who cannot break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He accepts to retreat the substitutes at the foot raised in the studios.
Without housing, he makes a tour of the sofas of his friends who want to receive him again.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrate, with self-destructive behavior," Coen, who won several Oscars and awards in Cannes with his brother Joel, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, Van Ronk's friend.
The film then takes shapes of documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an unpaid old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers’ magic still works by incorporating a strange character that is constantly going through the film: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis’s fortune companion.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled that he "grown up in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar,” he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to “be considered good,” “casualty can also launch someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let yourself get stuck by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times named him "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan, theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Decreased physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, was sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Without a doubt, between 120 and 150 million all countries are confused," he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment in a building on Foch Avenue a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted a few of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or ivory brought from 130 countries to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with the advantageous chest, wearing a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an unpaid Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractual agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, runs into the ranks of all the evils of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
For each book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a bustle of violence and torture.
“I never pretended to be a literary author,” said Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don’t send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went to the scene and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS’ father said “to make a kind of geopolitical leaflet.”
"I am constantly in my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often preliminary: thus, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he starred in the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar al-Sadate in The Cairo Plot, a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he the 4X4 columns of jihadists who were founding on the Malian capital.
I’m not guessing, defended Gérard de Villiers, I just make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM margarite writing machine from 1976 "whose parts were changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with the pen.
On the walls of his office are hanging AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photographs of the author with African warlords.
Regularly punished for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers once said, “Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age.”
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
Aircraft manufacturers argue about seat width while large orders are at stake
Disputes rage among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at this month’s Dubai Air Show.
The conflict is about the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courtied by airlines, but to whom allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45,72 cm) in economy classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says that it should be airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record order during the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft – in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is crucial for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its redesigned 777X will be able to accommodate 406 people in the economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in the economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aviation giants often exchange strikes on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to step ahead of its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, we realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ commercial director.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average 40- to 49-year-old American weight increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average size of the 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the perimeter of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus added that it ordered a study that indicates that an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures regarding seat width and says it’s not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience does not only depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business,” said Kent Craver, who is in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don’t want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their company better than anyone else.
For passengers, it’s more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it’s increasingly a matter that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders estimated at least $700 billion at market prices over the coming decades, enough to bend the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first in July, the seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a seat-per-seat yield in their latest long-haul two-engine models that is 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in 9 rows.
The gain in unit cost is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to get more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of Passenger Comfort at European airline Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
“A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers airlines have to choose from.
Aircraft sellers traveling around the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider side-way seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of just another major modern large aircraft manufacturer, experts say it is unlikely that its appeal to the aerospace industry to set a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make the 777X sales wave forget.
Oracle shareholders annoyed by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposed remuneration for founder and chief executive officer Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the financial performance of its group.
The vote is not binding but comes to dull the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third fortune just eaten from the victory of his boat in the Cup of America.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison suffered a negative vote on his salary.
The chief executive of Oracle gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which failed its growth goals, but received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire fiscal year 2013, Oracle’s net profit grew by 3.5% while the stock exchange price rose by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index that rose 24% at the same time.
New nicotine vaccine could suppress smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then starts to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were calmed down," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so often that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistan Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday in Pakistan, security services learned.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in this strike, carried out in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shooting," a senior security official said.
Earlier, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, informed the British government that talks had been initiated with Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi not to be influenced by Obeid
New South Wales's former Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a café, after their expiration in August 2005, without a bidding.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr Tripodi's former deputy secretary-general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of negotiations that began in 2005, the government pressured for leases to be subject to a tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases concerning Circular Quay companies, which yielded to Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any bidding.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, Tripodi acknowledged, demanded a change in the government’s policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid’s orders at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the policy on commercial leases?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr Tripodi.
I don’t remember what we talked about, but it wasn’t that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press that the target was Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers holding a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity test”
The government is currently considering the possibility of setting up a “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it plans to extend repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a misleading means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government work document was released today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The crushing statements about ‘foreigners returning to the end of the row’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work should be protected – and I’t be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The work document outlines the 12 measures previously envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for “whether the job offer is authentic in case the candidate is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors him.”
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker was said to have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s troubled 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father’s death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
The work of HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will feature a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed connection between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study strengthening railway capacity and improving the duration of routes to northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it’s also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “unambiguously” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland’s economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network project across the UK.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to examine options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain for the moment in force in Australia
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases as long as they are in "plane" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not being able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that obliges U.S. carriers to do significant work to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” she said.
The matter is the subject of regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has previously spoken to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA revision that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and its reasons.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review the manuals, training equipment, hand-luggage transport programmes and instructions provided to passengers.
“Once an airline has checked its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronics such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during takeoff and landing.
At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people, according to the testimony gathered...
On that Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rift involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four people were slightly injured.
Alerted, gendarmes went to the scene to separate the fighting parties and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s mortgage lenders take advantage of the middle class forced to tighten their belts
At a lease lender at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a gold bracelet, ring and pair of earrings to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income isn’t enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third mortgage lending company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Borrowing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s mortgage lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not asking for a solvency check or salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of rising cost of living and overindebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to mortgage lenders to fill the gap as their economies experience a slowdown.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the rising household debt, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest household debt/GDP ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [the wage scale] are looking to complement their income as much as they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to pledge their personal items to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, approximately 70 percent of the items on loan in the city-state’s 200 mortgage loans are in gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s lock up my grandmother’s gold chain and we’ll come back next month to get it.”
In Thailand, the largest lending store operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores over the past few months.
ValueMax, which operates the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million in Singapore that it raised this week when it was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms Yeah points out that mortgage not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
Borrowing is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term financing.
People who go to mortgage lenders are not just those who have financial problems.
Wealthy people in Singapore also go to ValueMax mortgage loans stores to mortgage gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
“These can be wealthy people who need to borrow short-term for business or investment, or small who need cash to go a tough path,” Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of youth pornography in Scotland
A pastor who cared for youth in the Halifax region of New Scotland is accused of youth pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was serving, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Hudgins has resigned from his position.
The priest was released on condition.
In particular, they must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in a provincial court in Halifax in December.
He went to the supermarket in Nazi uniform before being thrown out.
A man wearing a Nazi uniform barred with a brassard with a gammy cross was asked to leave an English supermarket after customers complained to the establishment’s management who called the police, the store said on Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain said.
The store called the police to rescue, but "the time it arrived, it had already left without bursting," she added.
I was in the queue when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were mouthful.
“You don’t get out on the street like this unless you want to get attention,” a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to disguise as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda,” said Paul Dutton, explaining that he suffers from “mental problems.”
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania health system
The federal governmentins that the $325 million bailout plan for the vacillating healthcare system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the island’s aging population, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after the government consulted with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique difficulties facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
Additional 2,600 surgeries, including in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funds are also planned for appointment-free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, medical training, dedicated mental health services, and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania’s healthcare system,” Plibersek said.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict regime of report preparation and accountability.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count much “unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent assistance request it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “successful solution.”
“The reason we are here is that the state’s Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in 300 million dollars, and pretend it’s a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux’s adaptation of Denis Diderot’s novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never spills in lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, surveillance agency says
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons monitoring body said on Thursday, as violent clashes erupted in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) has arrived a day ahead of the deadline.
On November 1, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious calendar aimed at destroying Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Because of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as fighting erupted Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The militant group, which tracks the evolution of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, including 18,678 pro-government forces fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this number since then.
About 2 million people have fled the country due to the conflict.
Assad's troops are fighting against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they must complete their mission, which is to clear Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a continuing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OIAC, which works closely with the UN, stated that its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activity is planned at the moment.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the IAEA said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that the OIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the following month by the OIAC Executive Committee.
“I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the organization’s director-general Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the Assad government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed on one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentence issued against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution peloton.
Patek, who spent 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of the explosives used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on conditional release.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks targeting two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment, but they could have requested that the man, called “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb manufacturer, be sentenced to death.
The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators 10 years ago.
In tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged before the execution peloton,” Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van stationed outside, exploded just after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber exploded a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and was “dead” three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have experienced the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terrorist cell responsible for the slaughter – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces would kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he was laughing at the sorrow he might have caused other people.
The verdict was given on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Ms. Corteen said.
Patek, however, may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the much-anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to comply.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve widespread use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends before landing and not re-enable them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and landing, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is safely implemented – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We’re frankly tired of feeling like “room watchers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS, or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still not Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out loud from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored as they could injure someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also be banned.
The regulatory power regarding mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronics.
The pressure on the FAA has intensified in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New aircraft rely much more on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of commercial aircraft are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pushing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader line-up plane and drove it off to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low-visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common sense arrangements for technology-equipped travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rail was mounted on board a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was restored by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue center.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This watershed was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the tired bird had managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The watershed was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the broadest and most comprehensive survey from UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than slide into the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcanums.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – most business executives think that the control of these key skills should go back to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European Trade Area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed that a significant majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This conclusion, which can be found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a “significant change” that brings power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – reaching a change in the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% swing of votes in favour of the country’s stay in the EU in a referendum.
The prime minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies are supporting this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant shift in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
Employment and growth in the UK must be the priority and, as our survey findings show, for companies this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
The Colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not deviate from the Halloween tradition.
Last night, he and his wife distributed sweets to hundreds of guest children in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the eastern coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the celebrations have taken place.
In New York, thousands of people in costumes took part in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" district.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I planned last year.
We have fun like crazy people, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
He’s a good kid, he’s cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of Halloween, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” said Alexei Miller, the CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, which transits the majority of Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “for ever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn to Build World's Largest Marine Reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, retrieving an information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutins, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutins, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95 percent on London's generosity.
The Council of the island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The draft must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to sanctify those 836,000 square kilometers, but provided it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already conduct the very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million square kilometers of the ZEE of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board planes – but it will still be forbidden to make calls on mobile phones.

Former Chinese Deputy Governor sentenced to life
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, in northeastern China, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of earning more than 19 million yuan in bribery, official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the chairman of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and managers obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
While the head of state promised that justice would be as unbeatable with the powerful “tigres” as with the “flies” – subordinate officials – only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of Chongqing’s former Chief of the Communist Party, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting top positions in the state.
But the government has in no way expressed the intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a body independent of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord during a royal commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 during a hearing by the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: an employee of the YMCA was accused of child pornography offenses and a physical education monitor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer at the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was unaware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate, emphasizing, “YMCA external checks were carried out and indicated that children’s safety was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord’s recruitment and that he had omitted to check that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the Children’s Safety Policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord’s misconduct towards children’s safety.
Staff members testified that they had noticed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was staying alone with the children, keeping them private, making them sit on his knees, telling them he loved them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had sought child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah’s head of child care Jacqui Barnat, who ran Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The CEO said he rejected staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord have blurred their judgment, causing them not to report his actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his point of view before the New South Wales YMCA board saying that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not be about “reporting” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were cited, was made by YMCA’s chief child care officer, Liam Whitley.
He said the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was “excessive zeal” and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University to the Commission.
He said there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old gave his opinion on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair said, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may be likely that this will happen, so..."
When many horseback events experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy, win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the little boy and his pony Shetland Toffee trolled during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – who are of the same size – were praised for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian center in Rudry near Cardiff.
Appearing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a bit on the side in a casual way to have his 2-year-old pony Toffee wander around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural training qualities uncommon for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good ratings for its presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They appeared against and against everyone, but both racked the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy for joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it.”
He walked all the length of the track running and even though he seemed small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year event – and I’m sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They form a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee performed well and how they performed on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I’m sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be remodeled”
A Chinese newspaper that appealed on the front page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revised, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete redesign,” the regulator said.
The order for “reforming” comes from the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several mistaken articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express editorial was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete revision of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately re-manage the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a call on the front page for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen’s apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year banning authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in “unavailability”
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in line.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear heaters at the Charles de Gaulle, in mid-October and while the ship was in the sea, was "without danger for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has confirmed that the ship is "unavailable" until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a Naval Defense Specialist, assures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty heating system.
“Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013,” DCNS said.
And the National Navy to certify that "this does not in any way question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is undergoing an interim maintenance period of six months.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for a training.
This is especially true of young fighter pilots.
A "little damage", limited to the confinement space of the reactor, had then occurred on the ship Admiral of the French fleet.
According to the Navy, the crew was not exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative expenses to end.
In other words, we have no limits on our pockets.
Millions of wasted dollars could be saved in order to enable a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major, we are not bothered with the sumptuous expenditure and maintenance of the cocked ducks: deficit cultural center, strong subsidy to the Energy City, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they may be sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also regrettable to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not public levels to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were delighted to learn that the Fisheries and Piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (big water consumers) and the great decline of the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to great things with other people’s money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a statement.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We’ve been managed for over 40 years by cravates with mostly beautiful degrees and I don’t think a sheep farmer does worse.
U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels serving for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they’ve ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging over a length equivalent to six football fields in length, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with indeterminable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs got out of it passing unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to criminal records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of selling.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after marijuana harvesting in central Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge to drug cartels who have to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an approximately 700-yard passage equipped with railways that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana house to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “delivery notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible routes under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking for political asylum from this South American country.
“Scotland Yard issued a warrant of surrender against a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at a police station at the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions for his release under caution.
The embassy declined to comment on the release of the notice by the police.
Assange is afraid of being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against classified information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Have you finished the passwords to enter to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that “the century will be biometric.”
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a transversal and transnational universe like the Internet.
Privacy organisations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission of Informatics and Freedoms authorized 774 fingerprint, hand shape or venous hand network recognition systems in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
What is the reason for such optimism in some and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new technologies, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
Each of these techniques has its limitations.
“For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes needs to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as face recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computing capability of computers needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border checkpoints using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
As a unique and infallible marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” says Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospects at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers criminal police services a suitcase costing €90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (assuring that the person is who they claim to be).
Identification previously concerned the issuance of identity papers: biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has about all citizens already registered.
This ensures that one person is not trying to usurp someone else’s identity.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We are retrieving images from surveillance cameras and comparing them to photos of celebrities that are circulating freely on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, head of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other uses: take a photo of a quidam who is in the queue in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Initially, authentication concerned physical access (boundaries, protected premises, cantines...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the friend pointing for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some dealers by inserting his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces typing the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and large distribution brands: when paying in the store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger in a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tips to Reassure Users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box thirty seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailored options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks up if one tries to move it," lists Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, in the absence of extensive studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts are still worried.
“The advances in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted a £1,000 almond
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to be carried between his legs.
In the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the breach of conduct without the necessary caution and care.
The seven points removed from his license resulted in a six-month withdrawal of his license.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a £90 fee and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax on Foreign Property Owners to Break the London Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the measure of capital gains tax but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties within a company rather than as individuals.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and amounts to £708 million in fiscal year 2012/2013, which is more than the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and the Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Mr. Cook said: “Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-evasion law on the matter, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestige real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving sector southwest of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in central London show a steady year-on-year growth of 5.6 percent but have been eclipsed by a “domestic market” in full growth, with the southwest of the city, the north (7.4 percent) and the east (6.5 percent) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just revealed how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that just like in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs’ disorderly tail movements, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films depicting other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to trade the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog moving its tail to the right (from the viewpoint of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail deviating mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know by experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added, “If you meet other dogs repeatedly and you notice that most of the time their tail movement to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will react according to that experience.”
The researchers say the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better grasp the emotions of their pets.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the dog species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs went more easily toward a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what was shown in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully regard the animals in the movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Al many evidence, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys have postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield’s band was scheduled to perform on Friday in the Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, her laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.”
“Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform.”
The show will be held at the LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20 and at the Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for any additional assistance.
Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranked church men in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so this falls to a group of 120 “elector cardinals.”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals voters will likely decrease.
He said that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as needed to get the number of cardinals elected to 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The consistory next year will be important as it will be the first since Pope Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to favor Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
The Pope decided on his own.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero explained.
He added that it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is entirely new.
Valero indicated that popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “filled with surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair seats
General Motors Co. is recalling 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to fix a problem with the manually sliding gearbox, according to a statement from the U.S. vehicle safety regulatory body on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for headsets.
“If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head support may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury,” according to a statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first quarter of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% over the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock rose by 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
Probably work on the foundations has been taking place in this place for some time.
A mitoyan foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve its tools.
I was passing by a car and I saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the site.
I landed and went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
I could only see a part of his back, it was so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is a 50-year-old man who worked for a coffering company.
Resuscitation maneuvers have been attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The shout of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made praiseful efforts disappointed by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse Obamacare’s difficulties, nor drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I’ve been reading a very sad book these days.
This is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients at night and I go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with a overwhelming victory, and newspaper presenters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept of joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transitional period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like getting out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of opportunities from the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passing of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, through the end of the “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide any explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the intercepting of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the privacy of Americans, nor the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misconduct.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and excess spending permitted during the presidential campaign.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it can’t excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don’t know if that was what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, as the opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I listed above seem to be largely the administration’s choice.
That is what annoys me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow determining his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that have been heard for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index dropped below 45% this week, it’s even harder to go back to 2008 through this book.
He made me wish for the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on the right track and stay loyal to their cause.
“I want us to reconsider our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, I disagree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 15:00, a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The driver, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the immediate intervention of the rescuers, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MEP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who disputes the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has used this argument to try to exclude questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott’s daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
"He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially stated that Palmer won Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a redesign of the voting system to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencil to mark ballots.
Is it possible to delete the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not seeking any reward, except the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical moment,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of bush dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM), returns to L’Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of dolphin?
This is good news, but I am not surprised.
If in the past species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or belonging of a species to a gender, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are questioned due to the advances of genetics.
Similarly, two very closely related species morphologically have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case for the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific bush dolphins and Atlantic bush whales.
Recent studies have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral outbreak or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, closer ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the sea environment is the least known.
One would rather send robots to Mars than know what lives in the Mariana pit, just 11 kilometers from the sea surface.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it’s time for that to change.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the case, showing once again that the global regulatory investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigations carried out on the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had transmitted records of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was suspended from his position as the European director of cash trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European head of cash currency trading, was fired this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS explained this week that it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating allegations of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations about bankers who allegedly colluded to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are scrubbing instant messages and emails that have been sent for years to find cases of reproachable acts.
News about these surveys have shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment bank trading units over the past few years, but which has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start to have an impact on the market at a low cost.”
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its fund office trading the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted on his own and that the deal was controlled,” a representative of Credit Suisse said.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been broken, supports a lawyer
After police confirmed that they had seized a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby argued he had never seen a “so messy” investigation.
Ruby said he believed to The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby called "inexplained" the fact that police never searched Rob Ford's car or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair informedly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search – even without a mandate.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman, Mark Pugash, described Ruby's remarks as a "evident and desperate attempt" to be claimed by the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock markets fall in mid-session except for London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges were down on Friday at mid-session, plunged by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe the US Federal Reserve could end its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
On the contrary, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the entire euro area, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could soften its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures predicted an upward opening of U.S. stocks after two consecutive sessions of downturns.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest downturn of the CAC 40, plummeted by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) recorded the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also releasing falling earnings this morning and announcing the creation of an internal "bad bank" structure that brings together £38 billion of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) remained at the forefront of the raises of the EuroFirst300 in response to a press release asking AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, shows.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues to retreat against the U.S. currency and hit a two-week low at $1.3517.
These same assumptions, on the contrary, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Healthcare Reform Act
A major victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court declared today that the healthcare reform bill ratified by Obama is constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, subject to paying a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxation power.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and, in addition, found that the provisions of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered on penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, were coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The proceedings to block the law have been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 primaries, including nominated candidate Mitt Romney, have been fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute to former fighters in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening in a violent clash at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on November 1 after its fuel reserves were exhausted, the Palestinian Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank gunshot during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, south of the Gaza Strip, local medical sources said.
Two other local al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on tunnel digged by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and a armoured bulldozer made an incursion of about a hundred meters inside the territory before subsequently withdrawing.
The fighting lasted about half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during a Zionist invasion of Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
“Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier,” the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli military said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel excavated in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the military, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to abduct Israeli soldiers in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting the Tsahal forces (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel hit a military air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles intended for the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an “Israeli strike” but did not give details about the target.
“In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Israeli officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” it has not named, the Saudi capital channel said that “the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, relying on a network of militants and medical sources, was unable to identify the source of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
A evening that allows you to see all the prisma of Chouinard, from art to tics and black from ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white as it is, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, stands, of profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, with only their hands and face uncovered, wait on each side of the play area, rush when the next graphic appears, embody it, run out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solos relays, in unison groups (a mass that is solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Gloire du matin", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed in line at the front stage.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux’s poem, monochrome and monotonous in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to resume, and the sequence to resume.
This long, noisy and energetic discharge, if possible, ends up dulling and thickening.
The same applies to the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes—imaging has always been a force in Chouinard—like those hair that blink or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux’s work, has imposed itself, with his tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’ ink, like Gestalt forms, opens up a wider, more porous imaginary than dance.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers shaved by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience loved it and the reception was warm.
The gymnastics, after the interruption, is richer.
The scene is partially drawn in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers rejoice to play the partitions.
Their mistakes in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, the couples pass, in loving duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Lovers are carnivores, fugitives or gamers.
The gestures, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coit, of beings who merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after the salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce into a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is Chouinard’s art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it hailed at the pole during the patent auction that took place after Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed lawsuits against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to search terms on the Internet, the findings of the trial said, which is the core of Google’s business.
It was not possible to contact representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to eventually offer $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market in part based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Al Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction, it violated and continues to violate those patents,” the court said.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion in a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater caused the explosion
She allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which injured two people seriously on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, was due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the Deputy Attorney General of the King said on Friday night.
The expert sent to the scene by the prosecutor assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and accumulation of gas.
The life forecast of the two victims is still committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his partner, was next to him and was slightly burned.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," Mayor José Paulet said.
Injured, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and alive, he was able to reach the ground floor through the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the CPAS president.
Firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
Crisnée Civil Protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Morsi has sworn in, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he swore the oath of inauguration to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore before the 18 black-dressed judges of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to acclaim the new president and, standing out from the presidential fast of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the Muslim Brotherhood’s uncharismatic “help wheel,” his personal prestige has strengthened considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, in a blue suit and a red tie, said, addressing the judges present in the wooden hall where he swore.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his inauguration speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem as he put himself on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by the song “The people and the army, hand in hand...” sung by thousands of people gathered in the university’s large amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and formerly a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a feudal of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi swore a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the outcast former president, deposed.
But by accepting to officially swear before the Court, rather than before the Parliament as it is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise of the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown in most federal administrations weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, figures released Friday by manufacturers showed, with five of the top six achieving performance below expectations.
The three largest manufacturers in Detroit showed two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million sales at an annual rate and adjusted for seasonal variations, but the market was set at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight braking is explained primarily by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer feelings during the first fifteen of the month."
GM, however, a 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their business performance improving compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase by 14% over a year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194 301.
Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140.083 vehicles, up from 143.536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show lower sales than consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Renault plummeted on the stock market due to Nissan warning
Renault blamed on Friday for the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had lowered its annual net profit forecast by almost 20 percent, traders.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a revision, also announced a change in its management.
Several traders that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a trading officer at a Paris broker.
In the framework of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data on Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously wounded Friday night by shootings by two people aboard a motorcycle passing in front of a Neo-Nazi party premises in the western suburb of Athens, a police source said.
Police have not yet been able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the source.
Police from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes weeks after six MPs of Golden Dawn, including the party's leader and founder, were charged with participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for addressing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are without electricity across the province shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8,642.
The large region of Montreal is also experiencing a lot of shutdowns with 7,000 households without electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results thanks to Australian and UK vacationers.
The travel agency now expects to an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 percent growth from the record $290.4 million profit reached in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% earnings in the first half and that the second half had started strongly, for non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on track to record results over the entire fiscal year before interest and taxes are deducted,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector achieved good results while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a profit over the entire financial year for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shoot at hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unknown people opened fire on a hotel near the Egyptian pyramids in Cairo on Friday, without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, the interior ministry spokesman, police general Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt has barely received any more tourists since the army destroyed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and has bloodyly suppressed the protests of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce “new texts” to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining literature and English language will be removed.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
He will make changes in other key matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the examination regulatory office, will reveal a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “a broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,” insisting that GCSEs would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time in math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
For comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to mathematics, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the deeper mathematics GCSE – as well as the greater importance given to topics in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more class hours.
The program will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a bill passed in July in that state that largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 went door-to-door to demand candy on Halloween.
One of the neighbors of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told the police he was scared.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo leader buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, to Bild.
Müller did not survive the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common pit of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the daily, citing archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great mysteries of the post-war era.
The German secret services, the BND, assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Ministry of Aviation by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a general uniform.
“In the inner left pocket were his service statements with a photo,” he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the Mitte district town hall in Berlin stating that he was buried in the neighborhood’s Jewish cemetery.
The chairman of the German Jewish Central Council, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a great deal of bad taste.
“The memory of the victims is grossly shattered,” he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller was one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks through mud, jungle and rivers to offer free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma of which he would bear the consequences for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 o’clock, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Dr. Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and three-quarters of the country’s health spending is made in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 free surgeries over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they get stuck in vanes after fixing medical equipment onto the roof and crossing difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help the most.
Luck does not always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy trails.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the celebrations.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people at each visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get a wig, a pair of collected glasses, or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, council or home; after the procedure, the patient stands up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Through the lighting of the electrogen group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a striking rhythm, but villagers’ musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They are knocking on the drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue to work,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgeries for free over the past year, and they know that their presence can make a difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to cure a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to bringing this traveling hospital to life and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he sleeps,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for field learning that they don’t have at home.
“We may have participated in operations to help sponge the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their retirement, transportation and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to fading.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The Two France by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
Certainly, but by highlighting its weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrating the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the editor’s hidden work and underground writing.
He was the heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy.
Certainly again, but knowing that such a sacred can not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it passed.
They gladly recognized him as a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but observing that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Memorial Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues could see there a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a vivid glance and lust of erudition, but incurably amateur.
The two books published by Nora here soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed by not writing had a lot and well written.
This book should definitely give him justice.
Yet here we find, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation made to jump as if joined from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brocanteur back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
In short, we were asked collectively to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the affair, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
Peter Nora is different.
He does not stand as the heir of eternal frankness, he refuses to define.
An analyst worried about a familiar strange, he wandered in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the shape of rebuses, tormented by annoying questions.
Among them this one, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its borders, so formerly carved and solidly carved, are these dramatic calls for unity heard?
They are not so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, but to conjure the disorder born of the discord of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that divides national history into two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; concerned, on the contrary, to regain its sacrality and all the more avid of unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And hence an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora’s American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For both America and France have made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American couture only makes better emphasis on what is ours.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men overwhelmed by an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here it sowed drama and confit.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models one struggles to make, and who have in turn killed one another.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch up and attempts to resume.
France is coming, France is coming.
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could pick up the tearful dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who were then engaged in repairing the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and proposing them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity only lasted for a while.
Here it is again in debate, crushed by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of claiming minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the outline of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises.
It was discovered that the chimney was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The liner was in the middle of the center.
And he who had deposited, behold, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had abstained from the initiative exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually do it.
Certainly in a less steep, more bruised and more subtle form.
But let’s not go wrong, it’s just as compulsory.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former Lebanese hostage: “Return is complex enough to manage”
Abducted in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
retired in 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to get the opportunity for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Arrested for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQMI (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
Gradually, they try to resume their life.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of "Antenne 2" at 8 p.m.
What are your memories of your release?
Especially in Beirut.
When I’m released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I encounter – without seeing him because it’s black – Roger Auque.
He tells me, “We’re released,” but I’m not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel website where the press is present.
We were sent to the French Embassy.
It’s time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I took a bath for an hour.
Dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to the Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We landed in Orly.
Prime Minister Chirac is here.
It is a bit brutal.
There is an incredible bullshit.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I’m back and it’s full.
The descent from the plane’s stairs, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists are pulling out to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some from climbing.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn’t stop, we’re well placed to know.
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and suddenly we are under the media fires.
It’s a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
We did the hardest.
I’m at 8 p.m. and the next day I’m on TV.
Then start some sort of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like holidays.
How did the medical examinations and debriefing go?
I had the right to a first medical examination in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the days following my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and a meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not handed over to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also talked to the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It was logical.
It did not bother me.
How do you respond today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I listen to what is said.
Particularly the ransomware.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I’m trying to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my chair of the “Hostages of the World” association that allows me to put a distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
For example, the definition of resilience.
Above all, I struggle, with others, for the recognition of the hostage’s legal status.
I think there is a semantic problem.
Hostage-taking should be described as “political” – which is most often the case – and allow hostages to have access to justice, file lawsuits and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who said that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is set up for this.
Why not say to the hostages, “You have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice?”
It seems to me legitimate, reasonable, and reasonable.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists protest Morsi trial
The anger is rising in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the ousted President Mohamed Morsi began, they went to the streets.
A mobilization across Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says the Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
This is not a trial, it is a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial, a pro-Morsi rebellion, it is he who is supposed to bring Sisi to trial, not the opposite.
Morsi must prosecute Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of Cairo’s police academy, where Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses have the right to a Defense Department identity card and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League fighting anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" deployed on their territory, he denounced, blaming these states for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The defense secretary said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
Texas refused to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal same-sex marriage law.
He was joined in his rejection by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage is approximately 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by Bump’s SK8 Unity section, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 15 a.m. and the prize delivery at 16 a.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already attending competitions at the highest level, like the young heroic prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he doesn’t like anything as much as going back to competitors who outperform him by three heads.
Toronto mayor chases journalists to question him about drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media outlets.
A video submitted to the court appears to support these suspicions.
The suspect, Rob Ford, has always denied consuming crack, while acknowledging a tendency to cannabis.
On Thursday, he evacuated several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
“An epidemiological investigation has been launched to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 including,” the ministries of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on people who are believed to have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
“As France has been free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not safe,” the statement said.
The French Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement that the last "indigenous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog imported illegally from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Rasiness is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time,” the ministries recall and it is transmissible for 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama goes back on healthcare reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of termination from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls a “evervescence in the news” about resignations, President Obama urged Americans who were receiving these opinions to look for new assurances in the market.
Most people will be able to get complete, better-suited health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The administration announced that it would not be surprising if the 5% of the population that contract their own insurance would find themselves forced to change regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace in October had "unfortunately failed".
“I’m as frustrated and angry as anyone else,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, as she believed her microcut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday’s Assembly session following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri’s Republican representative, on whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to insist on asking Mrs. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a diet via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel launches special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the automotive brand and the German flag, while incorporating the notions of speed and heat on the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, wore a special helmet for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, which was designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from his team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was scheduled to wear the helmet on Friday and Saturday.
He is likely to have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let us not mistake ourselves.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the Suburbs" is not only addressed to suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the big national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My first proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he said.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attacker, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he subsequently supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people of the right are willing to support me, I will also listen to them.
I’m not talking about extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to suburban residents and in particular young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the function of a building guard...
It remains to be found candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he admits."
It is a matter of time and money.
The party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven heads of lists in metropolitan France and in Martinique.
"And the emails of support I have received since yesterday do not all come from the suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry has admitted, unprecedentedly, that U.S. espionage “had gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
John Kerry said the United States’ defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs had risen, admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage had “goed too far in an inappropriate way.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of fierce revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities occurred.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity to do so, from World War II to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, September 11.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed boundaries, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force working for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns over the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had uttered about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration aroused by the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in our mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism," Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate's European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will travel to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA programs.
The press that the NSA captured millions of communications in Europe, which damaged relations with some U.S. allies, but the director of the agency said this week it was inaccurate and a misunderstanding as it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other disclosures documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phones and those of 34 other heads of state.
Intelligence chief James Clapper justified allied espionage by saying it was necessary and common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organising a congressional trip, which was scheduled to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route remains to be determined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world who do espionage,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plummeted by Shell's poor results and a day after an announcement by the Fed ofining its support for the economy, as expected.
Australian woman appeals on prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 for false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before it admitted to having invented the history of all rooms.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the hearing in court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center in the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women’s prison.
It is the daughter of former Australian League rugby player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously lived through a troubling time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released after paying a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime she was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heightened sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also seek to reverse its deteriorated image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.

Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission
According to the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff members to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between cultures.
The school committee has just revealed its vision of "Living Together in French".
Vision diversity has been walking through schools for a year to help students from all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of tribe or come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” explains Vision diversity president Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research center that will provide tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different pedagogical strategies, that is the real need,” she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
