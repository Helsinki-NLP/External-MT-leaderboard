Members of the National Assembly for Wales are worried they're looking like Muppets.
Some of the Members of the Assembly are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that it could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour Party MP said his party was concerned that  rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For those who don't speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means foolish/crazy, and pwp means what.
A Plaid member said the party as a whole was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that part of his party was "freethinking" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "Muppet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any words with which the members of the Assembly will be named, of course, will be made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of public consultations on the proposals indicating strong support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from the public consultations.
Members of parliament are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Elaine Jones, who is expected to table a draft bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying Assembly members and the design for the committee system.
The members of the assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was put in place in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president, György Ivanov, opposed the referendum on the name change, saying he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell has gone off as Harlem churches face problems
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, he has neither.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the slums where people go regularly.
And for the churches, he's worried that the money from the property sales won't last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later, they'll go back to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he said, "and so it will be fast-forwarding the day when these churches are closed completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the metropolis of the black  Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a strike of vendors on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but because members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carousel.
The Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon the "Poor Man's Bell".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "cultural treasure" and "indispensable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What's been happening at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by the inexperienced leaders of the church, and some by the Episcopal diocese.
The church board  the governing body of the church, composed of unskilled leaders  wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese was already asking for its expenses to be passed on  to the church board, even though the church board was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then rowed to the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "You got me!"
You're late!
His entire collarbone was visible, Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hamel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, taken in critical condition.
It's not clear what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescue captain, Larry Gills, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but decided the shark was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the Ponto beach side in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty racks filled with professional assistants.
As part of a significant push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home sector fall, the large beauty racks will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be introduced in more stores next year if they prove successful.
Investment in beauty came as supermarkets began looking for ways to use shelf space that was once reserved for TVs, microwaves, and appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double its beauty product offering for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also be given more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up line, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Creighton, south London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying smaller quantities of food on a daily basis at local stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased grocery sales and made shopping more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreements over how to share the profits from the supermarket chemicals stores.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a number of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-visit destination for beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million contract.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has gone "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of household products and accessories.
The couple's business is connected to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning show host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts  worth up to £1.5 million  meant she no longer had time to devote to their Truly brand of household products and accessories.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK on one of his weekends.
A source said that "Truly was always at the top of Holly's priorities".
That was to be her long-term future that would follow her for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely off guard.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the morning show host, one of Britain's highest-paid stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products from pillows and candlesticks to clothing and household items and the potential for further delay.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We don't comment on his business exploits".
We had a serious conversation and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said in his voice disguised as a "news anchor".
I didn't give up anything.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks were postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no "adequate response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We have a very good relationship with North Korea", he said.
We should be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great partnership.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results  they completed missile tests, helped free hostages and the remaining American troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, claiming hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no natural disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge", said Mr. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palo to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
With earthquakes continuing to hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palo, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling through many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A major issue in President Joko Widodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has gripped Mr. Yoko's administration in the face of re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
See, Daniel Staridge of the Liverpool team is tied against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Kserdan Shakiri passed the ball to Sturridge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before aiming it at the far post.
The ball was moving high above the sixteenth as it was spinning towards the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the leaping Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just kicked.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost halfway down the field, then sprinting into Liverpool's half.
They're fast-paced with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then fires a missile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defence and finished in the net on the long bench with a left-footed shot alongside Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videotone in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was engulfed by the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask people who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they will notify the victim's family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mowes just tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him he was not allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants have now been told it will be hours before they can return.
Someone overheard a policeman telling a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, covered in tears.
She keeps saying it's so awful.
At 2:00 a.m., two police cars were in the cordon, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing in the cordon and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Fighters Anonymous on 0800 555 111 citing the September 30 recording 247.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest memory blow in the quarrel over "rewrite history".
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as madness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconography of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
Cromwell's beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is a testament to 19th century thought and part of the historiography of a figure many believe is still worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell was a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and mention.
A pig killer rips up and kills a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a brothel in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to administer vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the neighboring pigsty open.
He said there was a big boar in the brake with pussy blood.
Forensics confirm that the 550-pound boar tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn", said the cousin, surnamed Wu, as quoted in the evening news of Guyang.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent attack by other people while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been previous reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an activator.
They're just playing.
They like to snack, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
Hurricane Rosa's debris will bring torrential rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rainfall flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane as of 5:00 a.m. eastern time Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to form a depression over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin bringing large amounts of tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create heavy rainfall in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause flash flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall in some places of approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
Flash floods are possible because of rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to go into the desert on foot in the event of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring locally produced rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall totaling more than half an inch is possible, which can cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since their wet season.
Temporary tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads further late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes are expected throughout the United States in October due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A prime example of a dramatic temperature difference will be in the central United States on Sunday.
There's almost a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-generate and expand.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October with high temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could hit 80 degrees Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christina Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued to unravel, with speakers interrupting regular programming for the coup at the last minute on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, struck a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh grabbed her piano and tried to strip her at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, stated that he was 100% certain that it did not happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people looking in offices.
To make it look better, it's a crowd the size of a football playoff game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose executives strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him being shouted at by protesters on Friday morning as he tried to get into the elevator for the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes closed for a few minutes as they reprimanded him, and it was all live on CNN.
"They're standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth on the ground?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on advancing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate ballot.
But Flake said he would only do that if there was a deal with the FBI to review the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and a few senators after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was significant, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the costs of the loan was "totally absurd".
Police arrested suspect Dayton Simpson in the death of a Louisiana State University athlete.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
Twenty-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB said.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail has been set at $350,000, his lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's office released a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head near the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for their active pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 guard grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Simms' death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", said the coach.
A volcano spewed ash over Mexico City
The eruption of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern settlements of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was following more tremors and aftershocks.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in populated areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police over public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote for Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Later that day, fights also broke out, and the police used batons to quell the fights.
For more than several hours, independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while trade union protesters chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low due to a boycott by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped out overnight on Friday to stop demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia had a chance at independence.
Last year was one of our best.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-selected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, filmed the protest in support of the police, saying the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"Everything is becoming possible", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners: men arrested after smuggling car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly crashed a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident happened in Ballynaard Crescent on Thursday at around 7.30pm BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, it could have been a single-shot to the car.
Menga's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 victory against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the win.
The up-and-coming Livingston caught up to the Rangers with the signing of Stephen Gerrard, with his only two losses in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Minga's incident proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side moved up one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side are unbeaten in the Championship this season and will face the leaders Hearts next week, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Livingstons remain undefeated in the division over six games, and Coach Holt still hasn't faced a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the brutal guests.
Holt's team needed a long lead before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his breakthrough, but he was dragging the attack around the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts from a distance after he slid the headshot of Craig Halkett over the goal.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems with the set stakes.
And that's exactly how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston got an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set up Menga, who just touched a field goal from the center of the sixteen.
By this point the Rangers had dominated possession, but could not break through the home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos scored a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow carried the ball away from another Livingston putt.
Livingston's sixteen was consistently passed and consistently defended, while two penalty requests  after Halkett's challenge for a replacement for Glenn Middleton and one for a handball  were denied.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston "Analysis" by the band
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony MacArthur arena
A phenomenal game and score for Livingston
They've been great, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style and character of play barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral on their toes.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
As good as they were under Gerard, they're falling behind by the same standards.
Their last game was a weak one. They only managed to open the hosts once. And that's a little bit of a relief to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been exacerbated by issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then heads to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protesters portray the divisiveness of the visitor celebrated as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Motorcyclist killed in crash in Deptford
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision happened near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy intersection in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision happened several months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been put in place and buses have been rerouted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado Unit were brought in to deal with the riots, which involve eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Officers are being treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been directed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the Public Order and Peace Police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (may be beneficial for dry areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's likely to do so early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert southwest region, posing a risk of flash flooding.
The state weather station has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, as far south as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Sweet Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move in a direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station tweeted that only 60 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mongolian rim.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated spots up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the areas at risk of flash floods, the Rose rain can be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides throughout the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and is receding.
Therefore, rain with tropical storm strength is expected in Mexico in the afternoon or evening hours of Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
Three to six inches of rain is expected from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches, weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rains in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the desert region of the southwestern United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and debris flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are asking if anyone has cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the most hatred and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's most brutal and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the most hatred and anger from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and on her charges.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and bravery that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of affirmation for one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the significance of the Republican primary.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting", he said.
That's why I'm everywhere, fighting for great candidates.
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to resist and to prevent.
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed up by huge waves hitting beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when waves as high as 6 meters (18 feet) hit the shore at sunset, carrying many to certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After the 7.5-magnitude quake, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster intervention agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it swept cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, could have amplified the magnitude of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications were completely damaged with no information from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were being sent to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to inform that a tsunami had hit Palo, although authorities said the waves came at about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the upper floors of the building screaming frantically, warning people on the street below of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water washes up on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency use only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The total death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees took shelter in tree shelters in the yard of their office, they passed through scenes of desolation along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief groups began grim efforts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palo.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can get international help, but we don't have the status yet.
As the second night in Palo fell after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the dark tale of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under a gun for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who are stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, when news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate in the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palo competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray tick mark instead of a blue one.
"I think it means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM at Newport Pier.
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was cashing in at an ATM at Newport Pier, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to top it up with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was meant to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Jay
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Y.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old West had been nicknamed Jay for some time and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show who had to quit for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think 'Jay' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
Which means I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It started from Cana, which means the one, the only, the only, the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pee Dee or Didi, but this year he revealed his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator Jay-Z also uses his name with or without a comma and all capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's acting president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
The military fired on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly aid to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about AI, even though the US has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China rolled out its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI would be a good start, considering that all other countries are so far ahead of the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI will be made by the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American lottery player, and later was a director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the previous competitions for U.S. government technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
China's State Council released its Next Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese State Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of the work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an ACCA.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation in the United States calling for the creation of a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its EU and NATO membership claims.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, entry into bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gose Taniewski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the back entrance", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said the result would be a confirmation of our future.
The poll, released last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes all of Brighton's defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal look so easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed through three of Brighton's defensive players before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four Greens.
He's got one defensive player out before he runs a couple more on the edge of Brighton's sixteen.
He then passed a left of him to Sterling.
The English striker used his first come-from-behind to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a single right-sided shot.
"Aguero has foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But the Blue Devils' initial lead was given to them by Sterling in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball into Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball down the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he led Sterling to the far post.
The Blue Devils' offense put the ball in the net before it went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to rush another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to make it to center field Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies had at least a Joker for a spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still fighting to cement their place in the top flight.
Even if we're not playing for nothing, at least we can throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is probably going to be playing at the highest level of any moment I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals are still due to announce a starter for the week, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start on lap 34, had practice pitching Thursday and will pitch his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his selection of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court while speaking about the importance of the Republican primary.
Everything we've done so far will be on the line in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big  I'm not running, but I really fight, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates, he said.
Trump continued, "You look at these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using every means at their disposal, you see the malice, the rudeness.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to step on it to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we're not gonna give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and to hinder.
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, rude and untrue.
He mentioned Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience responded with shouts of outrage.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting a minute. That was really bad body language.
Labour no longer accepts differences of opinion.
People who express their opinions are not tolerated
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last of a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome just for expressing an opinion.
My fellow MP, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly because of her strong stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the Friday night council meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately today, that's not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "soft, soft" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged as acceptable to the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never have otherwise taken, whether it was about national security or EU internal security.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it doesn't really matter what I say, there's critical harassment on social media calling for condemnation, denying the policies of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one with that experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for a vote of no confidence or a change in the selection rules, the party becomes more opinionated.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Back 32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party as a student, spurred on by the Thatcher government's concern that it had literally left my classroom crumbling, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never kept my politics a secret, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the demand on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes into a Brexit with a force that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how many condemnative threats or political opportunism I endure, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Ear 38  17 Melrose: undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Eare deserved the triumph in this beautifully entertaining day-match of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side in the top 10.
In the end, it's all due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which the home team has taken, and Coach Peter Murczy has every right to be pleased.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Eyre, they have taken their chances better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute point, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Eyre the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to improve his numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo extended Ear's lead with a penalty, earlier, just at halftime, he scored a point, then converted a solo point to make 17  5 for Ear on the save.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's point converted by Baggott cut the lead to five points.
There was then a long hold due to a serious injury to Ruairid Knott, who was carried on a stretcher, and from the restart, Eyre continued to struggle with Stafford McDowall's point converted by Climo.
Eyre's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man's unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with merciless pressure.
But the home team bounced back and when Strawan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking out Clima without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of Eyre's sharp attack.
Klimot converted, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took a shot from David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The "Still Game" star looks set for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kearnan is planning for life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun reported that Kearnan was trying to get involved in the successful Glasgow restaurant trade.
Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a cloaked naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right".
It's our duty to return it.
Across mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may now be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court on October 1 after five years of litigation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and calm and of course expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzada, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign sea access.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also highly dependent on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he solemnly declared in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even if it rules in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign territory to Chile and has said it will not decide the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And the last four years may have pushed Bolivia's cause backward instead of forward.
"The current Bolivian administration has exploited the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes", Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velez, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzasdia also dismissed that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
A decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past.
North Korea says it won't go nuclear unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Lee was speaking Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to think that continued US sanctions and objections to declaring an end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats that are on their way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of drops or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of unbuttoned oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The highly impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their eye-catching creations around the track.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide feathery border that covered the model's head.
Other oversized accessories included zircon belts, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like a scuba gear complete with goggles and a diving tube, and another looked like a melted cornet ice cream.
And if you keep making that huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that giant hats may come to stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that went viral on social media sent another great creation onto the runway, a straw beach bag nearly the size of the model it was dragging.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out in Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, as the designer has caused such a huge impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for too big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test scores, only reinforced by individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him imaginative.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike at his soul.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test scores, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade of 5+.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of 5+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved 5.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now, as an elective, seen on the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in independent school curricula, as elsewhere.
A 2014 OC Employment and Skills Commission survey found that of the reasons employers cited for job filling failure, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, learning a second language will give him a real advantage in the future as a life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give polyglot an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to communicate, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, that is, 15 percent of people.
So investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages they teach.
A few schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the OK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
There's no denying at this point, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, and this needs to be replicated in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It must be done.
John Edward is the headmaster of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is going to lead the Lakers to their first game in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is still up in the air.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited time.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
YouTube channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has launched a series of rallies as part of his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including visits to hot spots like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is in limbo, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans could lose control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally tonight in West Virginia and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online with a live YouTube stream.
This week, Trump is likely to address the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's arraignment hearing, which has become tense over sexual misconduct allegations with the Senate vote expected to be delayed by a week while the FBI investigation continues.
The primary goal of the rally series is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week are aimed at "boosting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to be named.
Scheduled for the West Bank Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday was Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows courage in the fight to keep hopes alive at the start of the individual competition on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, Saturday afternoon fours might have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The vicissitudes of luck are a completely fictional sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and especially in these games.
Who would you say is happy now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I guess", Jordan Spit said after today's contest.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, a four-point lead and 12 games to go.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel they have a slight wind in their sails even though they have enough momentum, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
The interview was excellent and set an example.
Those loud shouts of celebration grew louder as his game progressed, with a key shot that led to a four-four tie as he and Thomas had two missed shots after two rounds.
His game-winning shot at 15 was met with a similar scream, telling you that he believes the U.S. team is not out of the game.
"You just have to go deep and take care of your competition", Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to go for a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
The strange but beautiful duo of Europe are four of four and they can't be wrong.
The Hollywoods were the only couple without a bad hit on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided a bad hit on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way they seem to flow their energy to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players to secure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, other than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's preferable to both at the same time in different holes.
Yet, talk of European glory remains unjustified.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning's hero of the doubleheader, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A missed shot and two doubles from the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
Sunday, though, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
The double and fours are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't listen to and the way the strategy can suddenly change.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus gained a significant lead on the final day, but the season of fours also showed that the US team can fight although some, especially the Americans, were skeptical.
The Europeans lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins as Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team who had many mistakes in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more of a fight in the fours, winning two games, but they couldn't match the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual games this week to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and beat the exhausted Woods and American starter Bryson Deshambo by an even stronger score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who has been through two swords on Saturday, has had moments of great play, but now he's lost 19 of 29 games in doubles and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning doubles, returned as Henrik Stenson's partner in the fours with a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, Europeans were not at all comfortable on that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a new American record with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the doubles and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McClory by 4&3 in the fours, but lost on the opening, two-hole course.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point deficit in an individual game, although as title holders, Furyk's team had a tie score sufficient to retain the trophy.
After being second for two days, however, the weekly counterattack looks set to remain above them.
North Korea says there's no way to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extended sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance the country will unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Jong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no way we can unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a nuclear disarmament approach at this stage, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament without discussion, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump gave a guarantee of North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to budge on tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on nuclear disarmament first and foremost and is increasing the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have ended in such a dead end".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles at the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racing" with a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, much later praised Kim for his courageous steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Security Council sanctions must continue in full and without exception until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent funding of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea just hours later due to gangster demands.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to disarm its missile facility and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump gave Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates to sleep more in order to combat the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night on caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world's top university often know nothing about basic self-care.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
And at the end of the lecture, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, a picture of a dorm where students press coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how poor sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routines.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know it won't change student behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke", added Professor Chesler.
The culture of working all night is still alive, he said, and modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough good-quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon in the fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student, helped Professor Chesler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course across the entire campus.
He hopes the next step is to require all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students consider setting an alarm to tell them when to go to bed and when to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Manga's goal knocked Gerard's men down
The Rangers suffered another stunning, sad day as Dolly Menga's shot sent Stephen Gerrard's fledgling team down 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were keen to register their first win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gerry Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's team's second defeat in 18 games as manager which left his side eight points behind runners-up Hearts in the Scottish Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into halftime and the Rangers' lineup lost inspiration and chances to tie.
Now Rangers are down to sixth and Livingston have moved up to third, trailing Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be additional problems ahead for the Rangers after linebacker Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after apparently being hit by a long-range object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing the same Livingston XI that scored a point against Hearts last week and would have been delighted at the way his well-coached lineup snapped at opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but the Livingstons did more with the ball than they did.
They were due to score two minutes into the first half when Menga's first play sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Then a long-range shot by Keehan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only play openly on defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have gotten a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but referee Stephen Thomson did not sign off on the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to score just two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not swayed by Lasana Kulibally's header and the weak kick of Ovi Edaria.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute start may have been counterproductive to the game, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their play.
Once again, the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' shot.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Minga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the substitution had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a block.
But Livingston managed to get the guest players to play a type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead late in the game, but McGregor put up a good field goal and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow played head-to-head.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another penalty request after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson again disapproved.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac: "Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE HELP... the day in Germany that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then it has become a staple of science, the Geiger counter has become a staple of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell, starring these seemingly gullible, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that?
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactivity in the minerals.
Say, that must have jumped now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and growing them in a laboratory
You can see protein in many types of cancer and then it's returned to the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, swapping them in the lab so they can screen for a protein called HER2 in many types of cancer, and then putting them back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that shows great promise".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells works in treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump stunt wearing a cap with his slogan after a Saturday night live performance.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast Saturday night after a futile performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, which he wore a cap that said Make America Great Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Often when I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
The Saturday night live show kicked off with a satire by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, a video of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time getting behind the scenes because of his cap.
I was laughed at backstage.
They told me not to show up with that hat.
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the sinking place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken place?" He said he would put on his Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love".
His comments drew public outrage at least twice, and the evening show crew seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the label: "The whole studio is embarrassed".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Veste surprised many by performing "I Want It That Way", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by conservative TPSAD leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU for standing up to the mob.
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was on his own, which is absolutely wonderful.
But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now being formally known as Kane West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg goes by the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist from formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihakmor, police said.
The accused is due to appear before the High Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has been attacked by toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as the skilled swordsman John Snow in the violent, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #NowISay era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having strong feelings about the matter.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is it about TV and what is it about the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously there's something wrong with young men.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be involved in a Game of Thrones sequel when the series ended the following summer, saying that he "ended with the battles and the horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way she gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Iggrit, a character who had a love-hate relationship with Keith's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.

HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases were transmitted through sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, surveys show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of the disease is due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies statements made by a staff member linked to a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has asserted that the claims are from ultra-right sympathizers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Reddit have published that the IP address that identifies the source of the post is linked to Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff has been released, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these untrue and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous", wrote Fleischer.
This shows that she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
He must not be challenged.
He must not question the prosecution's motives.
He must remain calm and composed.
Fletcher appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was blamed by critics for looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also posted on Twitter.
"If true, that's a big deal", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the authorities and police of the false allegations.
"We will allow the perpetrators to be discovered", she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
The thought of Johnny English attacking again undermined Rowan Atkinson's spy schemes.
It is now traditional to seek out Brexit elements in every new British-related film, and that seems to be true of this reboot of the devious, action-comedy franchise Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Reborn.
Will the careful self-deprecation of the subject of how obvious we are to nowhere be the new export opportunity the nation has?
Despite all this, the big-eyed, grimacing face of incompetent Johnny English has been given a license to "stop things" a second time - his name primarily implies that he is a wide-ranging comic creation, made for movie-goers in non-English speaking places.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts at careful glamour, bears a slight resemblance to Clouseau, has Mr. Bean features and part of the boy playing a note from the Chariots of Fire song from the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once appeared in a now-forgotten TV commercial for Barclays, leaving chaos behind.
There's a moment or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I really liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor, and the rotor blades were hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since serious film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's freakish accidents are not as inventive and focused as the silent strokes of Atkinson's character Bean.
The theme that keeps coming up is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the disappointment of the agent in charge - a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best in this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired ones.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a teacher at a private school, but Anna Black gives classes on secret agents: there are some good guys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Beau, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in a relationship with a submarine commander, a comedic role that Vicky Pepperdine has not used well.
So Batman and Robin, to screw up everything at the Royal Secret Service, return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurdities: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they wreak havoc after faking themselves on Volta's luxury yacht; and English sets off into anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to get inside Volta's house.
All the brakes are off for the last scene, but as nice and loud as he is, there's plenty of kids' TV throughout the movie.
Nice and moderate stuff.
And as with all the other films with Johnny English, I can't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would use his talent?
Labour denies it is planning to make the British work four days a week but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan to make the British work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with AI to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would get the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea fits with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more worker-friendly.
The shift to a four-day workweek is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior party member told the Sunday Times: "The revised strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a move that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party had advocated a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of faceless CEOs and profiteers in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back because the Labour government could make "deductions" for unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed plans to have workers become part of company boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds whereby 10 percent of the capital of private firms would go to employees, who would be able to take an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, giving a statement to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings may prompt some Republican senators to consider withdrawing support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think it's obvious", said Kennedy.
I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, looks like it's carved into stone.
"My decision has been made on Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this:
Everyone she names they couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring celebrity acts, has an impressive mission: ending poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the large lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete a few tasks or actions such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or some other useful action that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen because it's 12 years away from achieving it all?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to demand action or just another case of click activism - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million activity from supporters, acting for many different causes.
They say these activities have helped to inspire world leaders to announce commitments and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and predictions resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion had already been sent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised directly affect nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are Power of Food, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers dedicated to "helping children reach their potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help with the country's malnutrition after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historical record", Ambassador Tracey Ullman of Power of Food told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It's going to be a long and hard road - we're never going to make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists performing at this year's New York City event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports.
Washington could use the navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russian intervention in Syria - namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a cover for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is to trade energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he is reported to have said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes remain open and if necessary blockade them to prevent their energy from reaching the market", he said.
Zinki addressed the audience at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the investment and replace the fuel", he said, while referring to Russia as a "disadvantageous country" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the "inappropriate" Nordtek 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nordtek 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion and is expected to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kemph, the first person of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider whether to run for president in 2020, said Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she will carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman at the helm", she said, according to Hill.
After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.
Warren praised President Donald Trump's work during the city council meeting and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent support such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination, and 48 percent opposed.
Other prominent Democratic Party names discussed for the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"From what my son is going through, what he's going through since he came back, I know how other families feel torn apart by post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest the "elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans come back a little different, they come back strengthened, they come back and they wonder if there's any respect for what they and their fellow airmen, and every other member of the military, have given for the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assault on a female, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 states and Washington City support a challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington are supporting a challenge to a new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed an amicus curiae petition Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. Parliament, filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner and violent gang members abused her, but the US authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was locked up in Texas.
The public defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many asylum claims in the United States originate, as nations with persistent gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Public Defender Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of legislation at the federal, state and international levels.
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the claim and such a provision violates that principle", according to the court petition (amicus curiae).
Furthermore, the letter's defenders argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering are harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs than to provide the necessary labor force.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum exists for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said at the policy launch on June 11.
Asylum was never conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palo as the death toll doubles in the race for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, ambulances are bringing bodies.
There's no clean water.
Residents return to their destroyed homes and pick up items they've been told they can save.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palo Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to frequent successive smaller earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the powerful quake in his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed in the rubble of the wall, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard the wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the baby.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of harassing us with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese state-run newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper listing the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge China has denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked, according to US intelligence agencies, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they are levelling import tariffs against each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former, longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling down on harassment with propaganda ads in our free press.
"In decimating propaganda, the Chinese government abuses America's cherished tradition of free speech and free media by placing ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the nearby newsstand here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see a true reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most widely read newspapers had declined his offer to publish the column, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are moving away from women's votes ahead of the midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn.
With many Republicans silent to watch or defend Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several sexual assault allegations, analysts warn there will be negative repercussions, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated they want to proceed with the vote.
There is no going back from such things, writes Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for the Hill in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he doubts the pressure on the FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November", Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a protest in the Senate floor as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans go ahead with the vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it's about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a majority accept the first-mentioned side.
A new Yu-Gi-Oh! poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, on Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, while drunk, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party while they were both students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, INRAPT, is a company built on the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up business.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online data warehouse, or POD for short.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming to you on the same browser at the same time.
What's unique about a personal data warehouse on the Internet is that it only depends on the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it data-driven personalization.
The idea of INRAPT, according to the company's CEO John Bruce is that the company provide the resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several development programmers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the INRAPT website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to implement a complete overhaul where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a Medium release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that INRAPT's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the start of INRAPT, Berners-Lee would remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross wearer of World War I
The only Church of England priest to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, he has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, the Honourable Bernard Van was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military decoration.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very thick fog and under heavy cannon and machine gun fire.
He later ran to the firing range and bravely led the way before single-handedly attacking a cannon nest and disabling three of the attendants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid wreaths after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was honored to be part of the parade, adding "The courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Belator 206 instead of Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you're up all night watching Belator 206 and you don't get to see the main event.
The San Jose roster contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that were shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gerard Mussi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying up late because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the download of a children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke".
"The law is that at 6am that content was inappropriate, so it had to be moved to a children's program", said Dave Swartz, Belator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
- The pig's egg, yes.
Company president Belator Scott Cooker said they would work on a schedule that would include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about re-releasing, I think we can probably find a solution", said Cooker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning, and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were favorable.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't. It was a legal matter.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we overdid it.
It's an unfortunate situation
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic show jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that they weren't like me.
Speaking on Radio 4's first ever Discs on a Desert Island show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show Kirsty Young has taken a month-long leave of absence due to illness.
Appearing as a minor character in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than everyone else growing up" because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathies for boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference are what have given me strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist Olympic has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without division and wanted to give HOPE to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone his age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daly said that all his looks had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept dying and one of the last things he asked them was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't here to be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Pride of Heather Small - which spins in his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he still rages.

Mickelson, not in shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to change his form to avoid an unfortunate turn.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the five-time champion often represents the United States, he divided his time to cheer and practice his game, on the range, hoping to fix what was holding him back.
Never the best driver, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the cramped Le Golf National, where long-range rough shots are a regular punishment for carelessness.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are down by four points from 12 individual games, get off to a rough start, Mickelson's play could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see any other way.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he touched me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furik said.
He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but it went like this, and we thought that's what we should do.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career where he never reached the best results of his individual career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun playing with him, like this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before individual events on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a disadvantage.
The Dane made his debut at a match in Valderrama in 1997, when the Steve Ballesteros-led team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they crossed the finish line with only their noses, with the smallest lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself we had a big lead at the Waldemar; we had a big lead at Brooklyn when we lost and at the Waldemar when we won by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on this team that this isn't over.
You go get ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play like it's right.
This isn't over while the game is going on.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn added, pleased with his players' performance on a difficult golf course: "I don't want to give premature ratings on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We have the individual games tomorrow, and that's a different job.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play solo, that's when all your golfing skills are tested.
That's the message we need to send to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will require players to play better individually than they did in doubles, with the exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the final day's changes because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser when Europe performed the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word there", he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, brought the players together before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, like we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We line up the line appropriately and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, like we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with taking on Rory McCloy first and facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the guys because I think that's how we'll cover everything", Bjorn said of the selection in the individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed again.
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and soaring prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wittemberg class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014 but problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wittemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Among other important features is the less maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent from home ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes De Waite.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wittemberg-class ships will have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was drastically overweight which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also became an issue.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the newest frigates are particularly important given warnings of Germany's reduced naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy lacks ships that can be deployed.
The representative said the problem has worsened over time, because the old ships are being retired but no replacement ships are being provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wittemberg class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A new survey of property in the Scottish Highlands is being conducted to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide answers about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the long-eared brown bats and the daubenton bats at Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the bats during the season.
N-H-S staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds from all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the species of bats.
Then a habitat map will be drawn to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect beds and habitat loss.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do adhesive tape for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their night-hunting habits make their ears useful for catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct searches, bed inspections, and occasional rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Treve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species that live in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Tribe we have a great bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, two very old and very good housing.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other sites will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before renovations are made because the unintentional destruction of a litter can destroy up to 400 females and young, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don't know how they live".
Ronaldo has denied rape charges and lawyers are suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations fake news, adding that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Majorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as fake news.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"What was reported today is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They like to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal. I know.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on charges they called "unacceptable transmission of suspicions from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player will seek damages for non-fatal damage in addition to an amount commensurate with the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was 99 percent "good boy" but relented below that one percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to a settlement without a trial because she feared reprisals and was worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she's now seeking a reversal of the agreement because she has injuries from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack happened and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will always regret losing the carmakers
Britain will always regret losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concernful" that Toyota-UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its Burnton plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border deadlock in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnton plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avenis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a shutdown of production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnton.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade would work in a no-deal exit, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-We, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU, for cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border that industry says could cause delays and parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's supply of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was precisely designed to avoid such border checks.
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only to have success in enjoying the present, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuevalari, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House has announced.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court justice continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential law violations by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Miller's independence has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified at.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh charges, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been determined, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things go and I always try to keep the press properly informed.
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the low number of briefings was not due to a dislike of the "great influence" of television journalists, though he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president hosts more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without providing evidence: "We have looked at those numbers".
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but while the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often and you've seen us do it repeatedly over the last few weeks, and conversations with the president of the United States will replace press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when attending open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely attends private press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in Scotland's national healthcare system about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national healthcare system expressing the country's gratitude and wishes for them to stay on after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of resolving status applications for EU citizens working in lower level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued over the summer, with the aim of reaching the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of no deal.
I know this is a very upsetting time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of value to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers defensive lineman, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline of the court and just fell to the ground", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the field, then placed him in a stretcher and took him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abercrombie is a sophomore and is playing his first season in the redshirt roster at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five sacks on Saturday before being out of the game, resulting in a total of 18 sacks this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administration fee when buying property in the UK
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administration fee when buying property in the UK, and this extra money will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay UK tax
The Ministry expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year, funds which will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administration fee when buying property in the UK, and this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The move would be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income earners.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay UK tax, with the additional funding reinforcing the Government's efforts to improve the situation of homeless people.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administration fee includes the higher rates introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of the property with the intention of renting it, can reach up to three percent.
The Ministry expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which has led to higher prices and made it difficult for first-time buyers to get involved in the residential property buying process.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the administration fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of offering high prices on properties that they hold onto but do not use and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for affordable housing in order to fix the shameful housing situation in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending evictions without just cause.
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my premiership to restoring the British dream, which is to make life better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy homes as easily as eligible UK residents.
The dream of owning one's own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of the homeless too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland".
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, said his ultimate ambition was to become manager of the Scottish national team in the future.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club who are currently in third place in the Premier League with just three points behind the top club.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But I grew up watching Scotland all the time in Hampden with my dad and something always drew me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I managed the club successfully.
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing he had to follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success at the moment is judged by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"Given the structure and facilities of this club, it definitely belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get this club back to where it was, but I'll probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back to where it was.
Ross has been a manager for just three years, having entered the career after working as assistant manager at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to League Three and brought St Mirren back from the brink of losing the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably a real crossroads for me", he recalls taking the "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough money, and enjoying certain privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through some things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in this role than I've ever felt in my entire adult life.
You can hear the full interview on Sportssound on Sunday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
According to one study, the ideal time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits of British pubs which are currently in a very difficult situation but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy firm CGA said: "The sunny weather and longer than expected for England's World Cup participation meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pubs' profits rose by 2.8 per cent and restaurants' significantly declined.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened further during July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks saw a much higher increase compared to previous years as opposed to restaurants that saw a decline.
Pubs that sell mostly food were also badly affected by the sunny periods, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the most successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while the sale of food increased by only three percent.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is hardly surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales over a year period will be particularly striking as a supplement to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the predominantly food-serving stores, and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much-needed respite.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in new brand announcements.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined revenues of over £9 billion and is a proven benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
The study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears that such accounts are posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had one main profile that they showed their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, create a social media profile that hides them from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts, short for the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has raised fears that such accounts may be posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a cleaned up main profile that they showed their parents, and they also had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile found a teenager asking others to rape her.
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admitted to having one of them a secret.
HMC's chief executive Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Elide Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated female athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport's leadership to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and global athletics community has a huge respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit immensely if she became a member of the committee", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am prepared to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help to steer the sport in Scotland in the right direction".
The American who won the 200 and 400 metres titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to winning a total of four Olympic gold medals and who now appears regularly as a commentator on BBC, was unable to go after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell whether or how well I would recover.
The whole process was exhausting, but I have made a full recovery, and I can walk and do agility exercises again!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows sparked a rift on the Internet
A breast pump company sparked a rift on the Internet when it ran an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is being billed as the "world's most delicate breast pump", user-oriented technology company Elvie released a hilarious music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cowshed full of hay to a song that goes like this: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't hips, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump, pump, I'm feeding the babies, pump, pump, I'm rubbing my breasts".
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the dairy industry's failures.
It's a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them just days after they are born", says one commentary.
The Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary reads: "This is understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?
Another added: "Really inappropriate advertising".
Others, however, defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "funny".
I think this idea is brilliant.
I'll buy a pump like this if I can still get it.
The milking made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product, one of the comments said.
Another commented: This is a fun ad for mothers who milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced while discreet pumps were being urinated into their breasts.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into the breastplate, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even leave the house while they milk.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and RDP at Mother commented: "Elvie's pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milking and dairy cows, we wanted to bring pump milking and the challenges it brings to the fore, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and intimate way.
This isn't the first time that Elvis' pump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Martha Jacobovsky wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared jeopardizing their own stay in the country if they applied to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress last week that the agency arrested dozens of individuals who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we're continuing to hunt these individuals down, Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the processing of cases involving children, authorities have introduced new rules that some of them will be required to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard required.
Many of them will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, in order to present their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to receive relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, say shelter workers and reports that have surfaced from the system in the past few months.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger facilities like Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely to ignore signs that the child is having difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends may add to the trauma that most of them already face.
Syria has told the American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally present in Syria under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that they would be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions", he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle" until we clear all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said conditions are good for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They politicize a question that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be eradicated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of government and opposition members soon to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution", and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidential term, which is likely to be the hope of many liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever seen!
As of now, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the strike-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up 1.7 million from the same period four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top of cable ratings with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is broadcast.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to because this is not something we understand", says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's television drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"Because I think it's really funny", said Mrs. Scovel.
There's a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the well-being of the global economy.
The exception to this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you watch a six-hour panel of experts debate the use of the "deep background" source by Bob Woodward for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 velvet bomber jacket and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does that makes you feel like you're watching a reality show is that he brings you something new every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's show's rotating team and daily reversals (NFL scores, Kim Jong-un accolades).
You can't afford to miss an episode because then you can't make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and it was 80 degrees outside his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't look away, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in jeopardy.
"I remember we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

An influx of foreign funds in the tightest midterm election in the race for the upper house
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is getting a lot of funding from reorganization of congressional districts where there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
This recently redeveloped Pittsburgh suburb is the running of Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won another district seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th Congressional District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Congressional District.
The maps were altered after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is unconstitutional.
The race for the new 17th Congressional District presents a tough campaign finance competition between the parties' main sponsors, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March midterm elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district that were characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this seat was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then backed out.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But only in relation to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of about US$140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the summit, diplomats say.
All three U.S. officials returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without reporting any harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate as described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their views were backed up by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn about history
The next thing that could happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very strong evidence in the public record.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our election.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to shoulder responsibility in that body as he prepares to reappear before voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties here, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, or that of his European colleagues.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have certain choices to make that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy either accelerates or delays.
Americans now face several such tipping points.
What if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly film the president and speculated that he was unfit for the position he was holding.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
"What if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI is incomplete or irregular, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault and perjury charges?
And first of all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will impeach Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy faces a long winter.
But I believe that won't happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika-logo table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers with an upbeat attitude ahead of the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win over Austria will cement their position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Dorrance, the midfielder due to a knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater success.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we came back with a winning point.
We might have given a little more at the end, but the outcome was probably a fair one.
They were better in the first half, and we gave our best in the second half and we were better.
We have another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good run in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough year, given everything that happened, my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a positive factor about the venue.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, put the past season behind us and achieve success.
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with family members.
About half of the participants in a study conducted by Nationwide said that they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, which can help you cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Get your legal paperwork in order: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Get a health care proxy so that you can authorize a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health care professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial resources.
This way, you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and pay your bills if you are unable to do so yourself.
Consider the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details so that you are prepared.
"It's not just about finances, but also about who the doctors are?" asks Martin.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan like this.
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was returning home from a night out.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST (UK Summer Time), as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, aid workers cannot get information from Donggala district, a region north of Palo that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo after the disaster.
Following are some key facts about Palu and Dongola, Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongola is a district that stretches for more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) along the coast in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The district, which is an administrative region within a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morawai, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency says that Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit western Donga in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them Aceh residents.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that devastates the southern coast and kills nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing desolation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police officials.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of release on payment of a $500 US fine, KTUU reported.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he stated that he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was going to testify in court, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence crime report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the festival on the beach in Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck in October to attack a bike path on the West Side of Manhattan's Lower East Side and run over pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saifov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and thought", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner as "horrific, brutal and twisted".
"Saipov has caused, injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagucho", the state's intent statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he asked to have the ISIS flag placed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saifov said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and sentencing to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference promised to mobilise the People's Army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone at a march in Birmingham said the UK would have been out of the EU by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in uniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by anti-Brexit Tory party members joining a separate anti-Brexit protest being held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to move forward with the Chequers plan despite attacks from pro-Brexit figures, anti-Brexit figures and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bonn told the Leave Means Leave pro-Brexit rally in Solihull that he wants to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan".
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be subservient now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate".
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party was also present at the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well received by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who are taking to the streets and to whom we owe our election victory.
Please abandon the Checker plan and start listening to us.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage told the assembly that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to surrender the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has enabled us to win Brexit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit figures marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend carrying banners reading "Tories against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference over the app the party created.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete and utter farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to give his presidential bid a lot of thought.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic Party representative was speaking about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she might replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, which uses a city hall format.
One of the people in attendance asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top.
Suspect in shooting and killing basketball player Simms of LSU has been arrested.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday, 247sports reported.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene, possessing a weapon, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 6-foot-9 junior growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after team orders secured victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton it became clear that the Mercedes team's commands would play a big part in the race.
From the half-position Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the brink as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Bethel entered the box first, leaving Hamilton to fight the distraction at the end of the group, something that was to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went ahead after a one-on-one action that caused the Ferrari driver to involuntarily leave the interior at his own free risk to stay out after a double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap finished seventh.
He then led for most of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the pits on lap 44, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
Today is a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me in.
"The team made a truly exceptional decision to have its own pair in the race", Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish the letter from Christine Blasie Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are mean and rude and dishonest.
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and reckless and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you release this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't publish it.
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish-- no, we didn't publish, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter with information about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish her story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did what she asked.
But the president didn't seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same at the rally on Saturday: "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations to achieve their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see their malice, their meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to regain power and control", the president said as Mediaite reported.
The elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the game against Dundee.
Dundee Stars compensated for their loss in Friday's Elite League fixture against Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took the lead for the home team before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee ahead of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefi's boys, who returned with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's chance came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFaul, whose addition was provided by David Rutherford as Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan securing the home lead with 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Cooney to make the score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first period, when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard returned with a powerful play and goal, with the score 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in the last half of the fifth period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of people take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to devastate the area, with many trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But even as his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the constantly shifting control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air flight number 6321 which was on the runway at the time would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower the moment he thought the tower was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Johannes Sirit, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said his decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palo.
"This news breaks our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be rising as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters) have devastated Palo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "The ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The supermarkets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready? " reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Nigeria said in a statement that they could not find the male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuck Island airport.
Officials on Friday announced that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane crashed into a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying too low.
"That's a very good thing", said Janes.
Janes said that he and the others managed to cross the halfway point of the water and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on the harbor's reconstruction also helped rescue people by using a lifeboat to bring them to shore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG in the past two decades, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst determined a time frame for the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors wrapped up presenting the case Saturday for a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is due to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to rule on the case later that day.
What is conscientious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to combat negative attitudes towards the genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as music with political messages aimed at addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-popularise hip-hop with a conscience.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced their own resurgence through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
A New York nanny is suing a married couple for being fired for sending a racist message.
A nanny in New York is suing a married couple for being fired on discrimination grounds after mistakenly receiving a text from her mother complaining about the fact that she was still a black woman.
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit actually constitutes "extortion".
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of work of new nanny Giselle Morris, she found out that she was black.
"Not a single black eye", wrote Mrs. Placebo-Flaxman in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Placebo-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "uncomfortable", she fired Ms. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing a poor job and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and seeking damages for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, an engagement that would involve her living with the family, which she was originally engaged to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do these things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the accusations of racism, saying that firing Ms. Morris was a reasonable move because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist", her husband Joel Plateau told the Post.
But would you trust your children with a person to whom you were rude, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's face it.
Claiming the lawsuit constitutes "extortion", Placebo said his wife had given birth to the baby only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
Would you attack someone in that situation?
That's not exactly the finest investment banker's line.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers fear readers won't be able to relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's really hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the enormous success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the book by a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was both bitter and sweet after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father felt quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't want to show off at all", she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you're proud of him even though the success is not your own.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was a creation of his own imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive", said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We're going to be together.
The effects of the medications given to keep her heart pumping were slowly fading and they were leaving her system.
She died early, which meant all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, or scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay in the closet.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the plight she was facing.
"No one knew", she said.
I bowed my head and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.
Mourning women place signs on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries place postcards on Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, says that her son had great potential to become a chef, and his smile was contagious.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died because it was a really dark place.
His brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that it will have a consequential effect".
Mrs. Davis makes the cards to let others know that there are people out there they can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to start talking.
Mrs. Humphries, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was unhappy or depressed, so he didn't say anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when the children opened their presents, and he didn't even look them in the eye or make any contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: "This kind of thing tears a family apart.
It leaves us broken.
But we must keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain since the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembled what he was looking for, which is a time-limited investigation, with a limited scope, maybe we could achieve a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would disintegrate in the face of entrenched partisan unrest.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican Party supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is solely due to timing.
The midterm elections are only a few weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush addresses the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There's a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to reverse the outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee population has declined under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Byung-seog, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most North Korean refugees eventually gain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss issues focused on the stalemate in denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S.-imposed sanctions for stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The House Minority Leader called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that given his temperament he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted like that, they would say she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes even crying and licking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and a coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he has been shown to be biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi did not answer a question about whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is he not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, but he's not fit to serve on the court where he currently serves", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about the possible rulings that Kavanaugh would make against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a subject of conservative justice.
In confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to walk into a courtroom and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it?'", Pelosi said.
Women should use it too.
It's really sharp criticism, months and years of building up anger, which she can't get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, and she told me that she cries when she's angry, but she's managed to develop her own technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's genius.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office was when I once started crying in an unspeakable rage and an older woman, a cold manager who I had always been somewhat afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they got to touch you.
Patricia Schroeder at the time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987 when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called the "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"That was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me 30 years later through laughter.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched long ago, she did not have sufficient financial resources, so she promised not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 each would give her only $250.
"Do they think I should get a discount?" she wondered.
During the speech announcing that she would not formally start a campaign, she was so overcome with emotion, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, she started to cry.
"If you saw me, you'd probably think I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Mrs. Schroeder of the media's reaction to the incident.
You'd think the Clinics would be my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.
Did she cry?
How a trade war between the US and China could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire with the onset of the US-China trade war has been deafening and even though the battle is far from over, the clash between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly this week with the imposition of new tariffs on goods worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has always been in the business of re-in-kind, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to pay back the US with equal measure, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting its demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could result in positive support for China in the long run as the interdependence of the two economies decreases.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of a sharp economic decline in either country is far more dangerous than was previously established by observers", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem said conditions in the country were improving.
'Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in an effort to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe defeated Team USA in the 2018 Ryder Cup by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the lead after Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, which was needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled through most of the tournament, hit the water in his first hole shot in the par-3 on the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranked player in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups became the European to win the most titles at the tournament with 25.5 points earned during his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year has been really tough.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to have been able to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He now cedes the place to his compatriot John Rum, who on Sunday won one-on-one against Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, by a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's an incredible statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to steer the game to the low-grass courts, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we were giving the European team a hard time.
We fought.
Drop it for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give it to them.
They beat us.
New information on red tide: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, conditions of uneven algal blooms were observed in the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide, caused by the red seaweed bloom, stretches about 130 miles along the coast from Pinellas County north to Lee County south.
Red tide features can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the number is still lower than last week.
Red tide was also reported in Pasco County.
The following concentrations were observed during the past week: moderate concentrations in or on the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsborough County, common to high concentrations in or on the coast of Sarasota County, common to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations on or on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation cases are still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No cases of respiratory irritation have been reported in northwest Florida during the past week.
