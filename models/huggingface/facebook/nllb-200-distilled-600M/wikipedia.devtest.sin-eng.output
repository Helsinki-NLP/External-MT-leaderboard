After Aknatan's death, she will assume the post of Empress/State Secretary for Tutankhamun.
For no apparent reason, the shape of the figure with the name of the figure is not changed.
Even in the immortal arts, kings are portrayed as bisexual.
When the immortal era changed names, people added the word "Atan" to their name, and the word "Amun" was quickly removed.
Since the names of the immortal kings have been erased from history, Manath's record is the only ancient record that mentions this.
Her successor kings used similar first names, and she was not given a royal funeral.
Her plot succeeds, and the Hittite prince Sansa comes to Egypt and marries her and inherits the throne.
Since her memorial temple was located in Thebes, the religious capital of the Ummah, the Ummah may have served as its temple.
It is controversial whether she has had a shared or single rule since her reign.
If a new crown was added to her crown, it would be a powerful testimony to Nefertiti's new name and title.
Her age does not seem to be a barrier to that status, as Tutankhamun ascended to the throne at such a young age.
According to some accounts, she adopted the name Smenkhare and ruled the country like a man.
Perhaps the authority of the land was not in Akkadian hands at the time, but in the hands of his secret and ruler.
Perhaps this is a temple complex.
Some have pointed to evidence that she is the Queen of Merit.
She became the queen of the kingdom after him, and was called Ankhpeperur.
She has come to this conclusion, taking into account the fact that she gradually married a "servant" Ai.
She seems to have a rather mild policy of "priesthood".
She died in childbirth on the royal tombstone.
She is considered to have ruled as a monarch.
It is said that after marrying her and entering the throne, Smenkhare used the masculine form of her first name as her name.
The tombstone, which was supposedly built for her, appears to have been abandoned.
After her husband's death, she used the royal name of Ankhiperur.
Whether she reigned before or after Smenskhare depends on her identity.
According to Alan, King Neffernfeuerwartan is the name given to all three of the above if the feminine characteristics are not taken into account.
Alan suggests that she may have been late for her first performance of the mecatane at the age of three.
Rarely, these names are followed by the word "reasonable" with feminine qualities.
Soon afterwards, she was promoted to the position of co-regent, and a fourth cartridge was issued to mention both kings.
The Egyptians have tried to hide the evidence of immortal kings from the future.
Among Egyptians, leading scholars have many opinions on this subject.
James Allen offers a ghostly interpretation of the existence of two successive kings of the same name.
That is why the name "number" was then used to refer to the content of the content of the smengkhare.
One scholar suggests names of different individuals for this purpose, but the debate has not yet ended satisfactorily.
She will be the chosen successor of Aknatan.
Which means she died near that time.
The same tombstone describes an ancient temple in Thebes.
If so, the vision here may have belonged to another member of the royal family, like Merrittanton.
This is because her heroes have linked her to Aknatan ("the favorite of Wa-En-Rei").
When it is associated with Nephernephruathan, its prefix represents an Aknatan-related hero, like "the favourite of Wa Enre".
It's supposed to be a few years after the cemetery's shut down.
He also claims that she was the queen of Dakmunsu, who had ties with the Hittites.
Also, there are no instances where the name "Nephernephruathan" is associated with "short" personal names.
And then, during the reign of Horemheb, the entire Immortal Age was abhorred.
She also felt that she had no need to use pharaohs' names, such as a double cartridge, to represent her husband.
Nor is it possible to confirm the date of death of the owner of the tomb or whether he served the new king.
It is symbolized by the Meritathon, who holds the title of Grand Royal Wife, and a gift to the owner of the tomb.
So there is no evidence of King Tutankhamun in the city of Amarna.
He will take sole control and change his name to AnciphalopteraNephernephrauthan.
Neffernfeuerrutan will take the throne after him.
By that time, Aknaton was trying to become a father to her daughters and grandchildren.
Eden Dodson's Eternal Sunset is considered the most modern work of fiction on chronology and the order of events.
They are often seen in the form of a "favorite" or "active" young woman toward her husband.
Four headed cartridges next to each other, enough to name two kings.
His findings were later confirmed by James Allen.
After his death, she gains full pharaohly authority and rules the kingdom under the name of King Neferneferuatan of Ankhpeperu.
He says that while Aknatan, Nefurnekaratan and Smenengkara are kings of Amarna, only a few rings are found as evidence of Tutankhat.
He said the name 'number' has different meanings depending on how it is associated with the name Smenkhare or Neffernfurraton.
He suggests that Merrittans demise was due to political inefficiencies.
The book of Egyptian history, written by him, lists kings by dynasty.
He will crown her with the name Smenkhare.
The cut marks represent the beginning of work at the final location chosen to establish her miniature.
However, the date of the apparition of Merrill's tomb is not given, nor is there any mention of Aknatan.
Gabaldi says that the wine chart of Smengkhare shows Smengkhare as having ascended the throne after Aknaton.
The inscription of Aknatan's name on Tutankhamun's tomb as the Queen of Merit indicates that she ascended the throne after Nefertiti.
A fragment of the priests found in Tutankhamun's tomb:
Since Tutankhamun was still alive and belonged to the royal line, Queen Meritathon must have worked to prevent his succession.
Dodson concludes that Nefertiti is the mother of Tutankhamun.
"The next argument is clearly about her origin", Dodson writes.
Dodson suspects she's also been used as a senior in the Tutancham State Yearbook.
Others still believe that Smenkhra and Neffernfaruatan are one and the same.
A priest of the Ptolemaic era in the third century.
The information about the connection between Dakhumsu and Sanansa comes primarily from Hittite sources written years after the incident.
But perhaps because she was unable to rule the kingdom, she was downgraded from a royal position to a royal wife.
But Alan believes that these titles and their appearance are simply 'fake' names that children are going to fill in the blanks.
But the rings and scarabberries that contain his name indicate that the city was inhabited during his reign.
But the item may have belonged to one of these two people.
But since the statues do not resemble Tutankhamun and his queen, it has been suggested that the images are of Smenengkar and Meritanton.
But there are also claims that they belong to Akkanton and Nephertite.
But recently it has been suggested that in the first year of his successor, his vineyard will produce wine.
But this argument is only a conjecture, since there is no date-coded evidence of the kings of the Reds or contemporaries.
However, his work is currently unknown, and only excerpts from his work have survived.
But the idea of Smenkhare's reign is still controversial.
Merenne also proposed a new kingdom of co-rule and no double dates.
Or because Tutankhamun succeeded her, his officials will bury her with a set of funerary items from another king.
Reyes sees this as an important factor in solving the Nephritis problem.
Much of her information was erased from history by Neffernfreuerton's successor.
Neffernfeurouathan's successor seems to have refused her a royal funeral.
Alan later pointed out that Neffernfaruatan's enemies can be divided into three types.
The evidence for the existence of a Nephronoferuatan, her gender and identity, is thus a factor.
Nephronoferuatons are thought to be the most volatile of the meritatons.
The one who most likely believed that King Nefertiti was Meritaton was Mark Gabaldi.
Nephernephruathan was an early name suggested for King Nephertiti.
The records of later years mention only a queen.
Later, French Egyptologist Marc Gabaldi noted that some of the remains found in Tutankhamun's tomb were originally erected for Neffernfeurouathan.
The Parry inscriptions describe her years of reign, so it is believed that she took control alone.
Surprisingly, it originated in the same temple as this other visionary and ruler's memorial.
Since Aknatan was not a male heir, the next Ankhsenpathan would be his wife.
Although the pot may have had the idea of a joint government, it may have been an attempt by a king to associate his name with the name of his predecessor.
Most Egyptians recognize her as a woman and a king other than the Smenkhare.
Mark Gabaldi has stated in several of his pamphlets and at least one book (in French) that she is a Meritart.
Mark Gabold claims that the Tutanhattan government has not ruled Amarna for more than a few months.
It seems that during her reign, the ban on the pilgrimage of the Ammon was lifted and traditional religion was restored.
According to Miller, they were "written with a deep understanding of the tragic failure of this strategy".
Miller says that "the word 'servant' is often used in a derogatory sense, not in a literal sense.
Previously, the name of almost the entire kingdom of Smensensk and the great royal wife of Meritatan was recorded in a stone table containing the inscription.
After the recent violence, it officially resumed operations.
The same can be said of the Hatshepsut text on the tomb of Penat.
Without granddaughters, there is no evidence to argue her age.
One could say that Mursilie is trying to shift the full responsibility of the movement to the Egyptians, revising history to some extent.
There are no instances where the name "Smenkhare" is accompanied by a "long" prefix.
While some of the facts of this hypothesis are accepted as true, the argument that Nefertiti was Tutankhamun's mother has been proven false.
This provides evidence of his brief reign.
This information suggests that Nefertiti was deposed in a power struggle.
The currency clearly identifies the letters "Djezer" and "Kherpar" and a part of the symbol "K".
These objects have become the basis of many theories today.
The importance of this argument depends on her name: it is so unlikely that someone would change his name to Nephernephruathan.
The statue depicts her as the queen at the time of the construction, with a flat top.
The shabby is made of two pieces, and there is a piece that is said to fit between the two.
Reyes explains that Nefertiti did not disappear and that she appears in a number of relics from Aknatan's final days.
This was also the basis for modern timing in ancient Egypt.
This was originally said and applied to her daughter's performance.
This is a simple logical argument used to describe the nature of heroes.
This is true, but Smengkhare has never had an independent state.
A daughter of Meritaton was born to Vitth Aknaton, who may have married her daughter of Meketatan.
Merritt-Arton felt no need to change his name.
The debate between Melesine Smenkhare and Neffernferuaton led to new interpretations of the evidence.
If her painting were present, it would be possible to see how Nefertiti's painting was modified to fit the new calligraphy.
If her entire picture had been replaced here, it would have meant that Nefertiti was replaced by a king named Nefertiti.
Most of James Allen's work here describes a woman primarily of Neffernfeerton, but she is not a smenger.
Nephertiti's name is replaced by Nepherthauran.

Six people died while the ship was under construction, and another died from a falling wooden head just before launch.
If the ship were full, it would be only a third of the size of the boats.
And the ship was not able to bring any more, because the bodies of the ship were caught by the waves and scattered.
The system consisted of pipes, tubes and valves spread throughout the ship.
Only less than a third of the ship's crew survived.
The crew was divided into three main sections.
The open decks were covered with planks and timbers, and the ceiling was made of coral.
Four out of five crew members are from the same city.
The bottom of the ship was also located on this floor.
Later, it was confirmed that the Titanic had sunk with hundreds of passengers.
The ship was tested for about 12 hours at various speeds, making quick turns and stopping.
During the training, the ship was tested for various features and tests were first carried out at Lake Belfast and then the ship was sent to the Irish Sea.
The first class also had a swimming pool, a gym, a skosh gym and a special bathroom called "Turkish Baths".
The first-class public spaces were made of decorated wood and included prehistoric furnishings.
The first-class staircase and gym were in the center of the ship, with the roof of the first-class lounge rising up.
The first and second class passengers were personally received by the captain of the ship and guided to their rooms by the Stewards.

The news had the greatest impact on the residents of Southampton.
Many families, especially those from Southampton, lost their creditors to the majority of families who joined the staff.
Most of the work was dangerous and was done without proper security.
Most of the passengers left New York to visit relatives.

The situation gradually declined during the day, and by that evening had become clear, calm and extremely cold.
These boilers were powered by burning coal.
The letter never reached the recipient and was returned to the museum in Liverpool.
These changes increased the weight of the Titanic and gave her the fortune of being the largest ship to sail the ocean at the time.
Each of these engines contributed to the rotation of a piece of the ship.
The event has been the basis for many books, films, songs, games, etc.
The ship was taken out of the dock, engine, smoke windows, top structure and interior trim, and was taken to another jet.
Thousands of books, movies, exhibitions, and festivals around the world have been published to preserve its memory.
The strike ended just days before the ship sailed, but it failed to have a significant impact on the increase in passenger numbers.
These steam-powered engines were always double-powered, with one always running and the other ready as an auxiliary engine.
All three classes were provided with facilities for leisure time.
The tourist post office and the Scotch Stadium were also located here.
Most Southampton families lost their lenders.

Perhaps if the ship had been completed properly, she might not have faced the misfortune of meeting the ice-skinned.
Some bodies were shipped to relatives in North America and Europe for burial.
Some died of heart failure or drowning.
Each ship was scheduled to sail three times a week from Southampton, England, to New York.
Each engine was connected to a long rod that rotated the blades.

The Bible says that "they will not be able to understand the truth, but they will learn the truth".
The path to Nibbana, or the solar pathway, is sometimes called the Dharma-Dhamma-Chip of these three disciplines.
A monk with a subdominant body told him that reaching the Nibbana goal was a success.
A person who has reached the state of Nibbana is called a half-breed.

After Aknatan's death, she will assume the post of Empress/State Secretary for Tutankhamun.
Since the names of the immortal kings have been erased from history, Manath's record is the only ancient record that mentions this.
Her successor kings used similar first names, and she was not given a royal funeral.
Her plot succeeds, and the Hittite prince Sansa comes to Egypt and marries her and inherits the throne.
Since her memorial temple was located in Thebes, the religious capital of the Ummah, the Ummah may have served as its temple.
It is controversial whether she has had a shared or single rule since her reign.
If a new crown was added to her crown, it would be a powerful testimony to Nefertiti's new name and title.
Her age does not seem to be a barrier to that status, as Tutankhamun ascended to the throne at such a young age.
Perhaps the authority of the land was not in Akkadian hands at the time, but in the hands of his secret and ruler.
Perhaps this is a temple complex.
She became the queen of the kingdom after him, and was called Ankhpeperur.
She seems to have a rather mild policy of "priesthood".
She died in childbirth on the royal tombstone.
After her husband's death, she used the royal name of Ankhiperur.
Whether she reigned before or after Smenskhare depends on her identity.
According to Alan, King Neffernfeuerwartan is the name given to all three of the above if the feminine characteristics are not taken into account.
Alan suggests that she may have been late for her first performance of the mecatane at the age of three.
Rarely, these names are followed by the word "reasonable" with feminine qualities.
The Egyptians have tried to hide the evidence of immortal kings from the future.
Among Egyptians, leading scholars have many opinions on this subject.
That is why the name "number" was then used to refer to the content of the content of the smengkhare.
One scholar suggests names of different individuals for this purpose, but the debate has not yet ended satisfactorily.
Which means she died near that time.
If so, the vision here may have belonged to another member of the royal family, like Merrittanton.
It's supposed to be a few years after the cemetery's shut down.
Also, there are no instances where the name "Nephernephruathan" is associated with "short" personal names.
And then, during the reign of Horemheb, the entire Immortal Age was abhorred.
She also felt that she had no need to use pharaohs' names, such as a double cartridge, to represent her husband.
It is symbolized by the Meritathon, who holds the title of Grand Royal Wife, and a gift to the owner of the tomb.
So there is no evidence of King Tutankhamun in the city of Amarna.
He will take sole control and change his name to AnciphalopteraNephernephrauthan.
Eden Dodson's Eternal Sunset is considered the most modern work of fiction on chronology and the order of events.
Four headed cartridges next to each other, enough to name two kings.
His findings were later confirmed by James Allen.
After his death, she gains full pharaohly authority and rules the kingdom under the name of King Neferneferuatan of Ankhpeperu.
He said the name 'number' has different meanings depending on how it is associated with the name Smenkhare or Neffernfurraton.
The book of Egyptian history, written by him, lists kings by dynasty.
He will crown her with the name Smenkhare.
However, the date of the apparition of Merrill's tomb is not given, nor is there any mention of Aknatan.
Gabaldi says that the wine chart of Smengkhare shows Smengkhare as having ascended the throne after Aknaton.
The inscription of Aknatan's name on Tutankhamun's tomb as the Queen of Merit indicates that she ascended the throne after Nefertiti.
A fragment of the priests found in Tutankhamun's tomb:
Since Tutankhamun was still alive and belonged to the royal line, Queen Meritathon must have worked to prevent his succession.
Dodson concludes that Nefertiti is the mother of Tutankhamun.
"The next argument is clearly about her origin", Dodson writes.
Dodson suspects she's also been used as a senior in the Tutancham State Yearbook.
But perhaps because she was unable to rule the kingdom, she was downgraded from a royal position to a royal wife.
But the item may have belonged to one of these two people.
But since the statues do not resemble Tutankhamun and his queen, it has been suggested that the images are of Smenengkar and Meritanton.
However, his work is currently unknown, and only excerpts from his work have survived.
But the idea of Smenkhare's reign is still controversial.
Merenne also proposed a new kingdom of co-rule and no double dates.
Or because Tutankhamun succeeded her, his officials will bury her with a set of funerary items from another king.
Reyes sees this as an important factor in solving the Nephritis problem.
Much of her information was erased from history by Neffernfreuerton's successor.
Neffernfeurouathan's successor seems to have refused her a royal funeral.
Alan later pointed out that Neffernfaruatan's enemies can be divided into three types.
The evidence for the existence of a Nephronoferuatan, her gender and identity, is thus a factor.
The one who most likely believed that King Nefertiti was Meritaton was Mark Gabaldi.
Nephernephruathan was an early name suggested for King Nephertiti.
Later, French Egyptologist Marc Gabaldi noted that some of the remains found in Tutankhamun's tomb were originally erected for Neffernfeurouathan.
The Parry inscriptions describe her years of reign, so it is believed that she took control alone.
Most Egyptians recognize her as a woman and a king other than the Smenkhare.
Mark Gabaldi has stated in several of his pamphlets and at least one book (in French) that she is a Meritart.
Mark Gabold claims that the Tutanhattan government has not ruled Amarna for more than a few months.
According to Miller, they were "written with a deep understanding of the tragic failure of this strategy".
Miller says that "the word 'servant' is often used in a derogatory sense, not in a literal sense.
The same can be said of the Hatshepsut text on the tomb of Penat.
Without granddaughters, there is no evidence to argue her age.
One could say that Mursilie is trying to shift the full responsibility of the movement to the Egyptians, revising history to some extent.
While some of the facts of this hypothesis are accepted as true, the argument that Nefertiti was Tutankhamun's mother has been proven false.
This provides evidence of his brief reign.
The importance of this argument depends on her name: it is so unlikely that someone would change his name to Nephernephruathan.
The shabby is made of two pieces, and there is a piece that is said to fit between the two.
This was also the basis for modern timing in ancient Egypt.
This was originally said and applied to her daughter's performance.
This is a simple logical argument used to describe the nature of heroes.
The debate between Melesine Smenkhare and Neffernferuaton led to new interpretations of the evidence.
If her entire picture had been replaced here, it would have meant that Nefertiti was replaced by a king named Nefertiti.
Nephertiti's name is replaced by Nepherthauran.
Although the baby's name is not given, it is possible to identify the baby as a girl.
The paradox here reveals that there may have been objections to the appointment of Nephernephruat or that such objections were expected to arise.
Meanwhile, there are the heroes of "Auton's Favorite" and "The Ruler".
So it's clear that there were two heads of state.
So these masks were originally designed for Queen Nefertiti, the mistress of Akhenaten.
These men have never met any heroes or cartridges of the Pharaoh.
Due to this dispute, Smenengkar was placed after Neffernfraier.
There are many interesting theories among Egyptians about the timing of this era.
Like many facts of this age, this fact is a suggestion, not a conclusion.
The focus is on revealing the identity of Nephernephruathan.
A small statue of Tutankhamun was also displayed in the tomb.
This simple relationship is therefore not always a representation of shared control.
For this reason, when a scientist has an opinion on one of his tenures and status in a debate, the others may have a completely different opinion.
This will result in no accurate information about the events.
This may be seen as a step forward in the argument for a reigning queen.
Reyes believes that Nefertiti ruled the kingdom independently for a while before Queen Tutankhamun ascended to the throne.
Although the close-up view of many of the monuments led to the publication of definitions of homosexuality, it was ignored by later evidence and revelations.
Evidence suggests that if he had lived for a very short time, it would be difficult to reveal the clarity of this.
If a person is missing from inscriptions and carvings, the simplest explanation is that he is dead.
After Smenkhra, Nephernephruathan of Ankhpeperu may have been the co-regent of Queen Nephertiti for a time.
The Egyptians have given little support to the Smenkhkare/Sanansa hypothesis.
Scholars have not reached a consensus on the succession of Smenkhare and Nefertiti.
The extremely vague nature of the facts encountered has made it difficult to prove various arguments.
On the Hittite side, Supiluliuma was well aware of the risks posed by the disclosure of the plan, but he thought about the benefits.
