I'll call him Monday.
Stamp the package and mail it.
Where did that go next?
I heard a very silly song yesterday.
Hall.
I'm too busy at work.
He stopped next to Thomas' seat.
Did Thomas love Mary?
Your life to the foreigner!
Happy birthday to you!
I remembered where I was raised.
I didn't invite you.
I made my feet.

May I ask how old you are?
There's a little brown dog under that table.
Come without delay.
Who does this?
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
I'm curious that Thomas is learning French.
Are you students?

I understand there's a man there.
The man who knows nothing inside.
You will get an internal book if you come to the Book Council!
Today is Tuesday. I'm buying fish.
What did you do with their car?
Learning through the medium of French is not necessary.

Were you at home yesterday?
Thomas promised to return soon.
My name is Jack.
I'll see you again.
"Who did this to you?" "Not me".
I hope so, because the barrel is full.

I'm waiting for the train.
Good guess!

I want to go to Sweden.
Thank you very much!
Fish is good for you.
I don't have to go.
How many trucks do we have?
The day is blessed for you.
I won't write good French.
This is yours.

Were you not tired?
What's your name?

These students are Koreans.
Are you sure?

What's her name?
This tale is far more interesting than the previous one.
Do you want sugar?
What day is it again?
The weather is as good as it gets.
I am learning the Greek language.
No wonder he is so angry.
She is very windy.
"Was it Thomas who gave us this video?" "No".
I wonder who came.
