The match started at 10:00 am in excellent weather and, with the exception of the morning rush, which quickly spread, it was a great day for rugby sevens.
South Africa's first-placed team went in the right direction, comfortably winning with a 26-0 win over Zambia's fifth-placed team.

The discipline of the defense, the handling of the ball and the excellent teamwork made them exceptional and it was certain that this team was the one to be defeated.
Amsterdam City and Anna Frankow Museum say the tree is fungus-infected and poses a public health risk because they believe it could fall at any time.
The execution was scheduled for Tuesday, but this was prevented by the court's extraordinary ruling.
Seven Sisters all cave entrances have an average of at least 100 to 250 metres (328 to 820 ft).
Infrared images show the temperature difference between day and night indicating that it's probably a cave.
By day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and by night they are warmer.
Their heat changes are not as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain relatively constant temperatures, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the astrogeological team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.

Chambers accused God of spreading death, devastation and terrorization to millions of Earth's inhabitants.
Agnostico Chambers claims that his accusation is unfounded and anyone can sue anyone.
The story, presented by Camille Saint-Saens in the French opera, is about an artist whose life is driven by a love of drugs and Japan.
The result is that the performers smoke marijuana on stage and the theater itself encourages the audience to join them.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Texas Governor Rick Perry and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann finished in fourth, fifth and sixth place.

Finally, there are many small cats (including free-living domestic cats) whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the eco-nick system, which means that each cat has its own tasks that prevent it from competing with others.
The lion is the most social of cats, living in large groups called packets.
The group consists of one to three related adult males, together with up to 30 females and young.
Female are usually close relatives and represent a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves similarly to the pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's shout is not like the shout of a full-necked lion, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouting words.

Scientists believe that the ocelots observe and find animals to eat (eat) by smell, when they know where they have been on the ground by cleansing.

When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, when crossing a mountain ridge or river or moving to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.

The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.

Corridors were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the trail was mostly made up of only parallel boards, it allowed the horse to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than other roads that were slightly thicker.
The use of rails was introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually found that tracks were more efficient if they had iron belts on their surfaces.
