Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, which confirms that although the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increased number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown pathogens was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, a novel coronavirus, is now referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, they have a respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In about 14%, COVID-19 infection worsened to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% had a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative COVID-19 count in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has spread increasingly geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently dynamic in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of EuroSurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first European confirmed cases of COVID-19 as defined by the WHO.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health bodies and the WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases intermittently over 14 days, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, during the period between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy during the period between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trends in cumulative COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK over a 14-day period followed those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative COVID-19 count started to rise around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It highlights that as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK reported a total number of cases already similar to that in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings suggest that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, despite different national public health responses, possible differences in country definitions and different protocols for choosing which patients should be tested to confirm COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy described the situation where nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on hospitalization and/or ICU admission of COVID-19 cases are available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to be collected in a systematic way to complement existing surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and Medium Care beds per 100,000 people in 201011).
Modeling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a risk of &gt;90% exceeding ICU bed capacity, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
Because cases have so far been aggregated in specific areas in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the level of the regional statistical unit designation 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
So countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the scenario of a sustainable community transition of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare, especially intensive care, like this one that is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As shown in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, comprehensive proactive approach is key to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as we shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is limited opportunity for countries to increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
SARS-CoV-2, like its cousin, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and affects older people than younger people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of the disease epidemic, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prognosis and its prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eradicate the disease that is a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable anniversary for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to a new viral disease outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease associated with it was named COVID-19.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research studies on COVID-19 have been published covering the virology of the disease, its epidemiology, causes, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 that identified the virus sequence isolated from several patients.
This review aims to summarise the research progress in the new and rapidly developing field.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by COPD, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prognosis as well as some pressing questions that remain to be answered.
Coronaviruses are usually considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, and have been primarily responsible for about 15% of the 4 common colds.
Yet, in this century, we've encountered two severe human disease-causing coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a staggering rate of spread and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with unknown origin pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, cases of infection among healthcare providers were reported, indicating the possibility of the disease being transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed with all public transportation stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that among the 41 confirmed cases of patients, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the infection's onset from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure (Figure 2) 2).
With the situation evolving rapidly, the final extent of the outbreak and its severity have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but it mainly affected those between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half of the infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread between communities in and around Hubei mainly.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (baseline reproduction number) was 3.77 (confidence range 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the modified baseline reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases is increasing exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the high travel before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.44% (confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%) and the modified mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a large, enveloped genus of viruses that contain a single-stranded positive ribose DNA genome.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and the sexually transmitted coronaviruses alpha and beta are known to infect humans.
The S-encapsulated sugar protein binds to its cellular receptors, which are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Sars-Cove and MERS-Cove dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPB4), respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genomic RNA along with the envelope proteins and the nucleated vesicles form vesicles containing virions, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus further.
The first genomic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% among 10 sequence-tested samples collected from the original outbreak site, the Hunan Seafood Market Bohan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Transmission electron microscopy has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 at a weaker binding than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a short neonatal protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibits IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have any range or pattern with a known function.
On 18 February 2020, Chu and others reported the full-length structure of the human angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme under a 2.9 Å ultracold electron microscope within a compound with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had coalesced to form a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to the S protein, providing a clue to the identification of the coronavirus and the infection.
The sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for screening for drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host.
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and been transmitted to humans through the butterfly and camel cats, respectively.
By comparing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus matching 96% with SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission pathway has not yet been clarified.
G and others proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans which involved a symmetrical reassembly within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that ant-eaters - long-tongued ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity in the coronavirus detected in ant-eaters and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference across two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, we expect conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical properties of Sars-Kov-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and humidity between 40 and 50 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine detergents, peroxy acetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorooxide, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race in general lacks immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and therefore they are more susceptible to the new virus.
At present, she has not requested any detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4) 4).
Generally, after a virus has invaded the host, the normal immune system recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) including the C-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), Nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I protein-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, the maturation of branched-cell, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large lymphocyte cell's production of viral antibodies.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T cell function by inducing programmed T cell death.
Cluster immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in fighting viral infections.
For example, I neutralized antibodies isolated from a recovered Mers-Cove patient.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which first appeared in groups, is more likely to infect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or between 3 and 7 days mostly, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, and thus prevent infected but asymptomatic people from passing the virus on to others.
As a common practice, people who are exposed to or infected with the virus are usually asked to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and primary manifestation of COVID-19, and may be symptomless or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia within one week of onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly progressed to severe respiratory syndrome, infectious trauma, metabolic acidosis, and spinal stenosis.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without having a pulmonary imaging scan, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, 3% for diarrhoea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that had been infected by someone without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with MERS' higher COVID-19 mortality rate.
Diarrhoea (26%) and strep throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it turned out that both fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and that respiratory support was needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% while the confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the basal reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 on a 95% CI confidence range of 5.71 to 7.23, while the basal reproduction number of SARS-CoV ranged between only 2 and 4.
A comparison between SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproduction number is shown in Table Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
So, SARS-CoV-2 is much harder to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of the disease in clusters often occurs in the same family or from the same cluster or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with people or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it was reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending a signal to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphocyte deficiency with a white blood cell count of 4×109/litre including a lymphocyte count of 1×109/litre, and elevated levels of the transporter aminespartate and serum virase were detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver, muscle, and myoglobin enzymes in their blood, and most patients had increased C-reactive protein and red blood cell counts.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of dimer D, which is caused by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Imaging abnormalities occur in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-lobed shadows or a glass-filled blur in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When A.I.S. occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid buildup, and advanced fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Malfunction of type 1 and type 2 lung cells reduces the level of surface stimulant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to dilate and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst chest X-ray results are often compared to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed lung cell shedding, hyaline formation, lymphatic drainage, and multi-nucleated cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to what happens in patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribose DNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) has been used as a key criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high rate of false negative results, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which no longer rely on RT-PCR individually) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
So a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, lab tests, and radiographic findings is essential and fundamental to making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects pieces of SARS-CoV-2-created ribose DNA at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mL to 200 × 10-18 mL (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a plunger in less than an hour without the need for precision devices.
We hope that the new technology can improve sensitivity and suitability dramatically if tested in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can provide primarily supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, stimulants, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs first, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other organs that release the angiotensin-2 transformer enzyme, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and non-invasive artificial respirators depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiopulmonary resuscitation technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and infectious trauma, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
A cytokine storm is known to be caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals, which is the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially in acute patients.
Stimulating hormones, tuciselisumab, and a monospecific antibody that is anti-interleukin-6 have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storm include modification of the immune response directed by T cells; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of genus kinase; planatumumab; inhibition of cytokine signaling 4; and histone descaling inhibitors.
Antibiotics and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at higher doses were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially atherosclerosis, which severely affects the prognosis of the disease.
However, the use of short courses of hormone-stimulating drugs in small to moderate doses has been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral therapy has been confirmed to be effective.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is an emerging antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other mono-chain ribose-DNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilead submitted the compound to China to conduct some trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being closely watched.
In addition, parisetinib, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after blubenavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation.
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a disease in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immune globulin (AG) produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and directly neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are essential to make this method widely available before definitive treatments can be developed.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an immune response to over-stimulation and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating patients with critical conditions.
It's difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
So isolating B cells from recovering patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode for active antibodies, or screening for active antibodies against the virus' core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are highly dependent on a combination of multiple components in a composition that varies by diagnosis based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as it is difficult to extract and verify these ingredients or their optimal compositions.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and their severity must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Paul Chang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine combined therapy.
They found that the recovery time from high body temperature, symptom fading, and hospital stays was much shorter in the Western medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine group than in the Western medicine alone group.
Most impressively, the rate of symptom exacerbation (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western medicine + TCM treatment group compared to the Western medicine-only treatment group (7.4% vs 46.2%), and the death rate was lower in the Western medicine + TCM treatment group compared to the Western medicine-only treatment group (8.8% vs 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still await further well-studied trials on a larger scale and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and to explain the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel extremely afraid of highly contagious and even fatal illness, and people under quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the side effects of medications, such as insomnia caused by stimulating hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorders.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric disorders were reported including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychosis, psychotic symptoms, delusions, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatizing their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contact points with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct interference with one another.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from infected animals and humans to susceptible hosts are essential and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-lasting antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Weakened live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS treatment.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the living body in the elderly, in lethal challenge models and in their prevention of source animal virus infection was not determined before a clinical study began.
Perhaps it's because SARS vanished 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, isolated MERS cases and clusters continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in the infected areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS have been developed using inactive virus, deoxygenated RNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of the protein composition, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is challenging because of the length of time (average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without any consequences.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of disease transmission and death in severe cases.
So building a disease prognosis model is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of disease in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
Age groups between 30 and 65 years were mainly affected by COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as shown above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not need it (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a predictor of outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as shown above.
Co-morbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart attacks and irregular heartbeats.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are closely linked and may interfere.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
A link has also been suggested between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate-dependent enzyme (LDH), amine aspartate transporter (AST), alanine transporter (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So, they're traditional signs of dysfunction in the heart or liver.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray imaging and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered alongside other problems to predict COVID-19 outcomes and complications.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressants as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of stimulant hormones have been widely used in SARS patients, many vascular osteonecrosis survivors have suffered with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced extreme stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological counselling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to reproducing in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or in the incubation period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were in a very satisfactory state, while most transmission of the virus did not occur in the early stages.
So, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
Efforts are currently underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost all the population in the hope of halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have done a lot of damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline will last for three to four months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-oar and throat scans of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a recurrent flu-like outbreak.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled through strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It's possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 could become weaker in terms of infectivity and eventually go away or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, raising a new possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great precautions need to be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have come into contact with sick or infected people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small ferrions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of ferrions able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is approximately 85 nm each.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks stacked together, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (series number 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses when working with patients.
For the general population in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is a good distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a new virus, its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have caused a state of high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human replication and that there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly reduced the general public's alertness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, a critical time to contain the disease to its lowest point in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be (1) more careful when releasing public data because every word matters to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrained to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more dedicated to issuing targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of and periodically improve the community's epidemiologic response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
It spread in less than two months throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a sense of recurrence of SARS infection.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger individuals and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A normal SARS-CoV-2 ribose DNA test can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become infected again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are still many critical questions to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to my numbers one and two, we can't stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak could come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathogenic changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells that secrete the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve as it travels between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, or will it fade away like SARS, or will it come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary, but it may take time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal origins of the human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution between coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown the other side to reveal how serious and life-threatening human coronavirus infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought a new focus on coronaviruses, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with the potential to cause disease compared to its sibling SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is an animal disease, so our understanding of the animal origins of the human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
Intermediate host reservoirs for some human coronaviruses have also been identified.
Identifying host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Investigating the interactions between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides important insight into the origin of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their date of discovery as well as their animal origins and transition between species.
More importantly, we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of viral evolution and genome reassembly.
In this context, the disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for successful host switching and the impact of virus evolutionary complications on disease severity.
Coronaviruses belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of single-stranded, positive-directional ribose-encapsulated viruses.
These viruses have the largest genome of all ribose-DNA viruses, at 26 to 32 kilobases, and are called "coronaviruses" because their structure resembles a crown under a microscope.
In terms of structural properties, coronaviruses have unbroken genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyprotein types pp1a and pp1ab.
The multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including spike S, envelope E, membrane M, and DNA protein N.
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of extra proteins from specific strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (Coronavirus alpha, Coronavirus beta, Coronavirus gamma, and Coronavirus delta), among which are the beta coronaviruses, which include most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, W, C, and D).
Evidence from genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origin of most coronaviruses alpha and beta, while birds are the main repository of coronaviruses gamma and delta.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have continually overcome species barriers and some have emerged as the cause of serious human disease.
Seven human coronaviruses are known so far.
These include the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-NL63, which belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta coronaviruses include human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus HKU1, and human coronavirus NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a cold, diarrhea, or both.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infection in a larger number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASDS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
It was isolated from the human coronavirus 229E, strain B814, from nasal secretions of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Much information has since been gathered through intensive studies of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which heal symptoms automatically.
In fact, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was harmless until SARS broke out.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest in our modern history, with 8,000 cases and an estimated 10 percent deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has emerged as a stable epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a scattered spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (NCoV-2019), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current pandemic 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 on 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses are from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Animal tracing of human coronaviruses has provided a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and limiting factors of interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate host, and enlarged host animal (enlarged host animal) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future fallout.
In this review, we provide an overview of animal origins, species transition, and the human coronaviruses that cause disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original human coronaviruses are usually pathogenic in their natural host reservoir but become pathogenic after they are transferred between species to a new host.
We are also reviewing the pathway assessment of the human coronavirus where an increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in morbidity.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the human coronavirus 229E was first isolated from nasal secretions of cold patients, different types of coronaviruses were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkey, rats, cattle, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and informative.
The first strain of the human coronavirus 229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to live in the lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients with HCoV-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, nausea, sore throat, with fever, and cough in approximately 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus OC43 was isolated from an organ farm and was later transmitted in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of human coronavirus infection OC43 appear to be similar to those caused by human coronavirus 229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms of infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nasal viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to be most prevalent during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human voluntary study, infection of healthy individuals with the HCoV-229E caused a mild cold.
Only a few patients with immunodeficiency have shown severe lower respiratory tract injury.
SARS, also known as "non-infectious pneumonia", is the first human coronavirus pandemic well documented in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the superinfectious carrier, it has been estimated that one case of infection can lead to approximately two second cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load appearing on day 10 of illness.
The onset of SARS-CoV symptoms begins with muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea, and chills, and is followed by late symptoms of difficulty breathing, cough, and shortness of breath.
Lymphocyte deficiency, liver dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory dysfunctions of SARS.
In SARS patients, widespread gum damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased number of phloem cells are also observed.
About 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs including the digestive system, liver and kidneys can also be affected and are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be especially fatal in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to research the human coronavirus.
The human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and HIV patients with respiratory diseases.
Cold, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample from the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is worldwide.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
The human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis, also known as shingles.
In the same year, the human coronavirus HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, the HKU1 coronavirus has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
The HKU1 coronavirus has been found to be globally distributed and causes mild respiratory illnesses, similar to the HKU-NL63, HKU-229E, and HKU-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and generally have a low likelihood of mutating to cause high-spread diseases, but the coincidence has occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more aggressive subtype of the human coronavirus NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infection in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses gain the ability to efficiently and continuously transmit themselves within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mers-Kov was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases brought in from abroad and rare secondary transmission of close personal contact have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, and are characterized by acute, exacerbated pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered acute renal failure, which is what distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30 percent of patients have symptoms of an intestinal infection, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
During mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients later identified as being caused by SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern as COVID-19.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in Hubei Province, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and manifests itself in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a large 82% homology in nucleotide sequence, they belong to different branches of the lineage evolutionary tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People who have been reported to have no symptoms despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed important similarities and differences.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in incubation and duration of disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 infection is between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e. human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are more common in community-acquired human coronaviruses, including the appearance of unspecified or mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of Sars-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns for both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmissibility of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether oral anal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worth considering whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in the case of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained post-transmission to humans, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired human coronaviruses with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
There's another perspective, which may also be true, that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of ancient human coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause acute human disease have been eliminated as well as humans who have acute human coronaviruses.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face restriction factors in the host.
And based on this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people are infected, the greater the chance it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it's difficult to stop its transmission from person to person through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses spread between human populations over many years, causing the flu in people with good immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal repository.
On the contrary, the severe paralysis-causing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and they could not continue to spread between humans.
They need to stay in their animal enclosures and breed there and then look for the right opportunity to move to more vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It's as contagious as community-acquired human coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it causes more disease than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether they will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or an intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be helpful to review the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, storage, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal plays the role of evolutionary host for the human coronavirus if the virus has a closely related ancestor and shares a high similarity in nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and not pathogenic to the host.
Similarly, the host warehouse harbors the human coronavirus continuously and long-term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if the HCoV enters the intermediate host recently before or near its onset in humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes paralysis.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and it also plays the role of an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit it to humans to spread infection between humans.
Human coronavirus infection can reach a dead end if the virus fails to spread from within the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host, even if they may colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
Later epidemiological data revealed that the first SARS case had a history of contact with prey.
Subsequent epidemiological surveys indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV IgG than normal people.
It was first identified that masked palm butter (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no other SARS cases were reported after all the zebra cats in the markets had been killed.
However, it has been reported that the SARS-CoV test result in masked palm butter living in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, indicating that masked palm butter may be only an intermediate hyper-host, but not the natural repository of SARS-CoV.
Noting that since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to Sars-Kov, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of the amplified intermediate host of Sars-Kov is not excluded.
It seems these are all hosts that don't transmit SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research on the animal natural host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of a closely related bat coronavirus, called HKU3 (HKU3 Chinese Red Horseshoe Bat Virus), which is found in Chinese Horseshoe Bats.
The result of screening for Sars-CoV antibodies in these bats and sequencing the genome of the Chinese red-legged horse-toothed bat virus associated with acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none can be isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is known as the Sars-Cov receptor.
WIV1 extracted from a bat fecal sample was shown to use the angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme in bats, zebrafish, and humans as a cell entry receptor.
Interestingly, serum from recovering patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome was able to equate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the virus most closely related to SARS-CoV in bats, as they share 95% of the same nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of Sars-CoV and that bats are not a direct repository host of Sars-CoV.
The Mers-Cove strain evolution analysis combines the HKU4 coronavirus in bats and the HKU5 coronavirus in bats themselves.
The HKU4 coronavirus in bats and MERS-CoV uses the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase4, to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV-based RNA polymerization sequences are closer in terms of lineage evolution to their beta-coronavirus counterparts in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Meers-Cove lives in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and HKU25 in the closest bat share only 87% of the same nucleotide sequence.
So the bat may not be the direct host warehouse of Mers-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only beauty that is actually a sperm positive for MERS-CoV-equivalent antibodies, as well as beauty of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The MERS-CoV live-match of the virus in humans was isolated from the nasal scans of the single-clawed camel, suggesting that the camel serves as the original host repository for MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms generally appeared in Gemal who was experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but a high viral spread was observed.
The infected camels were spreading the virus remarkably not only through respiration but also through the oral anal canal, which is the primary route for the virus to spread from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, and these cases have been logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RaTG13 in bats isolated from horseshoe bats is involved in 96.2% nucleotide homology.
The sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship to the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host and repository of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-matched bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are presumed to be among the wildlife species sold and killed in the Wuhan seafood market, which has been linked to several initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as the hornet ant eater (Manis javanica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2-associated origin beta coronaviruses.
The genomes of this new ant-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% of the same nucleotide sequence.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about a 90% similarity at the nucleotide sequence level.
Two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sub-strains are grouped in the lineage evolution tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence matching.
In stark contrast, the receptor binding regions for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ significantly, although the overall genome sequence homology is higher.
A previous study of sick scavenger ants also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, which turned out to be similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembly and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of approximately 86.3% full-length viral genome.
We can't rule out the possibility that the anteater is an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the ant eater is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 because of the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in the ant eater.
In addition, the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in the hive-eating ants.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, scavenger ants, and other mammals is still being determined.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV-2 and the parasitic ant-eater, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-associated beta coronaviruses share the highest sequence homology of the entire genome.
It is widely speculated that the high degree of similarity between the binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the beta-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 ant-eaters is due to selective affinity evolution.
There is a counter-proposal that SARS-CoV-2 in the beta-coronavirus ant-eater and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species are likely to be recombined.
Reassembly is widespread among beta coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-NL63, and human coronavirus-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence from evolutionary lineages has suggested that both human coronavirus-NL63 and human coronavirus-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of human coronavirus-OC43 and human coronavirus-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Highlands Coronavirus) detected in three-colored bats in North America has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, the human coronavirus 229E was found to be genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/ GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and it was suspected that the flies were also its intermediate host.
For clarity, current information on the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of the evolution of strains provided evidence of human coronaviruses being transmitted between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, there was an outbreak of respiratory infection.
The history of human coronavirus 229E transmission between species is still less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to human coronavirus 229E.
Among them is the alpaca coronavirus.
There is a lot of evidence to support the virus's transmission from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a common habitat.
Whereas humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E belonging to the alpha coronaviruses in bats is polypositive and does not cause disease in bats, while the alpha coronaviruses in alpacas cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca-associated coronaviruses have not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas have been infected with the human coronavirus-229E belonging to the human coronavirus alpha cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause human disease, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
So it's not surprising that bats might transmit the HCoV-229E directly to humans.
While alpha coronaviruses in bats play the role of assembling the genes of the human coronavirus 229E, alpacas and unicorns may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in Mers-Cove.
Meares-Cove gives an excellent example of transition between species, moving from bats to unicorns to snails and unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Cove was known from the early identification of bats and was also reinforced by later findings.
Apparently bats provide a rich collection of virus species for interchange of genetic fragments within a species and for transmission between species.
Bats have longevity, live in dense colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions for making them ideal "virus carriers".
Mears Cove, on the other hand, has moved to the lone beauty of the slums over the decades.
It may have adapted to this beauty well enough to transform from an intermediate host to a natural, stable repository host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains accidental and humans are a non-transmittable host for MERS-CoV where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the Meers-Cove transmission, the role of the anteater, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-coronavirus associated with the hornet-eater causes severe illness.
They may be non-transmitter hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the beta coronaviruses, similar to the yogurt cat in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies will resolve many of the possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans by either proving or ruling them out.
First, the bats may be a repository host for a SARS-CoV-2-linked virus, which is most likely SARS-CoV-2 homologous.
Humans and bats may share habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the hornet-eater may be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans get the virus by slaughtering and eating prey.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to COV-2.
There's a reason to do an antibody scan in pets and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, it's possible that SARS-CoV-2 has been reassembled and adapted into a third species that has contact with bats and the parasitic ant-eater.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, from the viral side there are three main and also important factors in making it easier for coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, it has relatively high mutation rates in the replication of ribose DNA.
The estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses, compared to other mono-stranded RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average mutation rate of ~10-4 mutations per year for site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronaviruses to new hosts.
Coronaviruses contain an external corrective enzyme ribonuclease, which removal results in a very high mutability and mutability or inability to evolve.
Interestingly, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, is known to inhibit the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting the enzyme ribonuclease exogenous and the RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, and is being tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than host rates.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt properly to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems to have already adapted to another human-like host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to Meers-CoV, which is well adapted to the lone-winged gull.
In theory, it's unlikely that genetic drift will help vaccines and antiviral drugs to resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides an extra loop in genome editing for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of species-to-species coevolution, which helps new coronaviruses emerge when conditions become favorable.
This is backed up by the unique abundance of open reading templates and encoded protein functions near the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly change patterns during replication of ribose DNA through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixed vessel, sequence replacement occurs repeatedly during replication of the RNA of the coronavirus.
Highly homologous full-length RNAs and secondary genomics may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence of evolution of normal recombination strains has been discovered in human coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43, as well as animal coronaviruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in bats and HKU9 in bats.
The virus interacts with the host associated with the transmission.
In addition to the three viral agents mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing species-to-species transmission.
In this regard, we take the SARS-CoV rearrangement as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during transitional events between species.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated SARS-CoV samples in humans and zebrafish, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the S-protein receptor binding domain.
In general, the S-protein receptor binding domain of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is highly selective through host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain occurs in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 region, which binds to the angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme in addition to the receptors that assist in virus entry.
The receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV is able to recognize the receptors of the enzyme that converts angiotensin 2 to help different animals, including bats, zebrafish, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were identified that were different from virus isolated samples from humans and the butterfly cat in the receptor binding domain, and four of them are in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the receptor of the enzyme that converts angiotensin 2.
The mutations K479N and S487T are found in the binding domain of the Sars-Cove receptor in the butterfly cat, which could increase the likelihood of the spike protein interacting with the future human angiotensin-2 transcription factor.
In other words, these two types of amino acids may be extremely important substitutes for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein, which implicitly suggests that the likelihood of binding of the S protein to the human angiotensin-2 transcription factor has changed.
Indeed, a study with ultracold electron microscopy suggested that there is a 10 to 20 times higher probability of this association than what happens between the human angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme and the S-protein in SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of helper receptors may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, the human coronavirus-NL63 also binds to the angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as protein analyzer N for human coronavirus-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-isostatic for human coronavirus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after they have moved between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of trans-species transmission of human coronaviruses is also subject to control by other factors of host dependence and limitations.
The dispersal of these host proteins between humans and the hosts of natural coronaviruses' reservoirs, such as bats, monarchs, snails, and rodents, may be a barrier to species-to-species transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control host dependence factors and weaken host restriction factors to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain detectable and characteristic.
Extensive, unbiased genome scanning can be used to look for SARS-CoV-2 host dependence factors and limitations using the advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of novel human coronaviruses: back to square one
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers ample opportunities for emerging human coronaviruses.
And based on this logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of the human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of the human coronavirus, and they are two important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes involves the ability to modify viral phenotypes to a great extent.
Of the regulatory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important in adaptation to humans, where SARS-CoV-related viruses were isolated in bats but were found to encode heterogeneous ORF8 proteins.
The 29 characteristics of the Sars-Cov nucleotide deletion were found to be present in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has led to the splitting of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through the alpha and gamma strains of coronaviruses, where a large number of small recombination regions have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The reassembly sites of nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14 have also been identified.
In a similar way, research has shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has seen cases of crossbreeding, which occurred in the one-of-a-kind Snowy Camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination cases have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where the human coronaviruses have combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also aid in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the virus's release from selective stresses, such as those caused by the host's immune system.
The loss of the full-length protein ORF4 in the phenotype strain of the human coronavirus 229E due to deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although healthy ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses, which is related to human coronavirus-229E, alpaca-infecting coronavirus alpha shows single nucleotide seeds, which leads to a mutation of the splice frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their host reservoirs.
Asymptomatic or mild cases have been detected in bats infected with coronaviruses, suggesting a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats adapted appropriately to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the weak activation of the inflammatory response in bats reduced the effectiveness of the pathogens caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to an increased rate of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and a decreased expression level of the major tissue-compatibility complex class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from the increased metabolic activity of bats can lead to both inhibition of coronavirus replication and correction effect by the enzyme exopropyl ribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of strains of virus that are highly pathogenic when a new host is infected.
Additional disease-causing strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
So it's no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in host bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
Herein lies the mystery of why we see carriers of the virus who do not show symptoms and why severe cases in human infection occur.
The acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of symptom-free carriers, the immune response is disconnected from the coronavirus replication.
A similar strategy of dissociating the immune response may have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 antiterapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I can be beneficial at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, activation of the inflammatory molecule cryopyrin NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this in mind, inhibiting the inflammatory molecule cryopyrin NLRP3 with the inhibitor MCC950 is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While it was discovered that beta-coronavirus in bats shared 95% of SARS-CoV nucleotide homology, there was also a beta-coronavirus in bats shared 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While zebra cats and other animals in the marketplace were found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, they did not discover direct intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Beta coronaviruses have been discovered in ant eaters that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that ant eaters may be an intermediate host or that ant eaters have contributed genetic fragments that led to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made, either intentionally or by accident.
Coronaviruses have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our view of the importance of animal origins and animal repositories of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The compelling evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from human-to-cat contact in markets, closing fresh produce markets and killing the cats was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, ant-eating animals should be removed from fresh produce markets to prevent transmission of animal-borne disease, and this is in light of the discovery of multiple strains of beta coronaviruses in ant-eaters that closely resemble SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, and also whatever the mode of transmission, through scavenger ants and other mammals remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
Meares Cove, on the other hand, has been found in the only beauty in the Snows for a long time.
These beauties are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
It's widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice all beauty to control MERS, as officials at wildlife markets in China have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV beauty vaccines, in addition to other infection control measures.
If we can't eliminate these viruses once and for all, new genetic patterns may emerge and cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases that originate in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses in bats are highly diverse, with the potential to cause animal-borne diseases.
There are many opportunities for animal-associated disease-associated coronaviruses to emerge and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In light of the hardships experienced by humanity due to SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be developed.
The fact is that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural reserves until they have a chance to spread and multiply.
Although bats have many characteristics that make it likely that viruses spread, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary procedure to gain a better understanding of the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which has proven useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-borne viral diseases is to keep people away from the ecological sites of natural stores of animal pathogens.
The mystery of SARS-CoV-2's animal origin remains surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to an ant-eater, it's important to know the conditions that set up the bats and ant-eaters to share a similar environment.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting disease to humans, then the way humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal species is the true intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and herbivorous ants.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, anthrax eater, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses are expected to be identified and nearly identical to their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, including important measures for COVID-19 prevention and control in humans.
The need to update the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (NCoV) 2019, which provided our experience and provided relevant reference information for global pandemic control.
Although the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical trials; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to Ward's comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (NCoV-2019) outbreak, now officially known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was named SARS-CoV-2.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a rapid guideline and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's received a lot of attention since it was published.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical trials; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, had seven versions in total with some contexts changing substantially.
Now our guidance is a response to a comment from Cho and others, who made a simple proposal for scoring based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidelines and also become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their efforts and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (experimental version 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case needs to combine any one of the elements of the epidemiological patient history characteristics and two elements of the clinical manifestation to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or needs to verify three elements of the clinical manifestation elements in the absence of a clear satisfactory epidemiological patient history:
Epidemic medical history: (1) history including travel to Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities with reported COVID-19 cases, or residence there, within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history including contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (with positive DNA test results); (3) history including contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan, surrounding areas, or other communities with reported COVID-19 cases within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history including contact with confirmed cases (2 or more weeks, including those with severe symptoms, such as violence in the home or office, or 2 or more weeks, including violence in school or other areas).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic features for COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a normal, low, or low total white blood cell count at an early stage of infection.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected condition involving any of the elements of evidence for the presence of pathogens or serum interactions as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, (2) high homology of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics, (3) positive serum IgM and IgG antibody test results for SARS-CoV-2, or a change of the IgG antibody from negative to positive, or a high parenteral elevation in the recovery phase equal to or greater than 4 times the level at that stage.
We see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second version (18 January 2020) and the third version (22 January 2020).
Blood sample pathogen detection was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then serum interaction manual was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications have built on the ongoing work of researchers to arrive at the design of an ideal set of tools for DNA detection for rapid diagnosis, plus samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of the positive result of the antibody to the criteria of confirmed cases.
In addition, there is growing evidence that we should be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptomatic conditions.
So, the content of the information flow chart for Cho and others should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
A scoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to access more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose a "suspected case" and a "confirmed case", we encourage you to follow and adhere to the latest guidelines issued by the countries where people are based.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
That's the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, the number of reported cases was 114 active cases and 33 recovering cases were in the home.
There have been 17 deaths.
The director of the Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, reported at an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases over 60 years of age, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Land Transport and Bridges, Ubayd al-Qadir, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport will be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The public transport disruption initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic goods, namely medical products, fuel and food, is still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three were already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has exceeded one million worldwide.
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
The serious development came on the same day Malawi confirmed the first cases of the coronavirus, and the first death related to it was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries still free of coronavirus cases.
The World Health Organization reported 1051,635 confirmed cases, as of yesterday, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. central European time (08 a.m. UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday were caused by the coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Mr. Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, announced on Thursday that the city's lockdown would be extended until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfew in Mecca and Medina to all day, from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike D. Wayne announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australian stores are lowering the purchase limit for toilet paper per transaction.
Australian retail chains Walworths and Kohl's on Saturday and Sunday evening tightened their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two rolls from Walworths and one roll from Kohl's per transaction in all branches nationwide.
Aldi stores also identified one wrapper, and that's Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at the checkout points of the chain stores and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have made a stockpile due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
Wall Worth stores on Wednesday approved restrictions on delivering toilet paper to homes to become one roll per purchase.
These changes came after previous restrictions passed by Wal-Mart on March 4 and Kohl's on March 5 allowing only four packages per transaction.
Kohl's in its March 8 press release reported that despite the four-wrap restrictions, "many stores still sell out within one hour of receiving it", calling the demand "unprecedented", and Aldi in a Facebook post on Tuesday calling it "unexpected".
Sales have "increased dramatically" in the past week, according to a Wall Worth store spokesperson.
Last week, a Costco store in Canberra also set the purchase limit at two lifts.
To alleviate the shortage, Kohl's stores asked suppliers for larger packages and increased delivery speeds, Wall Worth stores ordered extra stock, while Aldi stores made their stock available for specials scheduled for early Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
He expects higher production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few private supplies.
On Tuesday, Aldi Stores announced that due to early availability of stock, some stores will not be able to offer a special Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reports to News.com.au that stores fill up every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, which leads to a decrease in inventory in terms of numbers, and when it is sold out, it leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which reinforces the feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman, as reported by ABC News, states: "Kole and Wall Worth stores have the view [that] if there are plenty of goods on the shelves, and if products like toilet paper and sterilizers can be bought and made available in bulk, it might reduce panic".
Who Gives a Crap, a company that produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that it was out of stock.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Clinix toilet wipes, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorbent, both confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue to provide their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions have been held because buyers are off work over the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin daily, featured an eight-page advertisement folded up so it could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially hesitant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March; stores said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including curtains, sterilizers, dry goods, hand sanitizer and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado is listing Andres's toilet paper purchases as two 12-pack bottles.
The WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, has reached pandemic level.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent of the disease, not to the severity of individual cases, the WHO has warned that governments need to take the necessary measures:
"All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
"If countries detect and screen people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize them for the confrontation", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and danger as well as the alarming levels of inaction".
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus has traced its path from its initial appearance to its continued global spread, other than influenza".
Gibrisos expressed a similar view, saying: "We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "The bottom line is that it's going to get worse".
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) associated coronavirus 2.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is supportive treatment and for symptoms. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away, monitoring, and self-isolation of suspected cases.
Authorities around the world are responding to this risk with travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures of facilities.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and other regions where large cases of the virus have emerged.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries, there was a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan City (capital of Hubei Province), China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, so the virus is thought to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to coronaviruses in bats, crustacean ant-eating coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and this person did not have an apparent contact with the wet market group that was later discovered.
Among the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dating from 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases in China were declining, they had suddenly risen in Italy, Iran and South Korea, as the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of Britons would need to be infected before effective herd immunisation could be undertaken.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be infected according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases were undetected in China, as of 23 January, and that these unreported cases were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
An estimate of a statistical analysis published on 30 March indicated that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline replication number (R0) of COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it might be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from worsening of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 has caused approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of 5 February were concentrated in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths generally refer to those who died with COVID confirmed according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested - for example, at home, or in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death toll by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged, "We know that [the reported death toll] reflects an underestimate of reality", a statement supported by narrative reports pointing to the inaccuracy of the count in the United States. Such underestimates occur in outbreak cases; such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths outside mainland China had been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The death-to-infection ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-infection ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the mortality rate from infections have decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other metrics refer to the case fatality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of infected who died from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected (proven and unproven) who die from the disease.
These statistics have no time frame and follow a specific population from infection to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on case mortality estimates.
The WHO confirms that the pandemic is under control.
The peak and peak incidence are uncertain and may vary by location.
"Infectious disease outbreaks that are left unchecked usually reach a peak and then begin to decline when the disease finds no available hosts", stated Massage Bonney of Penn State University.
But it's almost impossible to come up with any logical predictions now about when that will happen".
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanchan said that "it could be over by June" if all countries can be incentivized to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be prevalent perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College London led by scientist Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly in 18 months or more)".
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "because it's so easily transmitted", and it could "turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The severity of the relapse will depend on herd immunity and how far the mutation has progressed.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively vague and may not show symptoms in those infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (pellets), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or blueness. The World Health Organization confirms that approximately one in six people have severe illness and difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits emergency symptoms to shortness of breath, pain or persistent chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and blueness of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Some people with no clinical symptoms may not show symptoms but test results confirm that they are infected, so specialists recommend that people with confirmed cases be monitored and screened closely to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44 percent.
The usual incubation period (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; often five days. As an example of the confusion case, the estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who initially lost their sense of smell was 30% and then decreased to 15% recently.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being investigated.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly during mixing or by spraying when coughing, sneezing or talking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without a mouth covering can be caused by a spray that spreads from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus may also be transmitted by a long-term airborne spray, which may be produced during speech. It may also produce respiratory spray during the breathing process, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray and then cause airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the potential for spread from feces to the mouth, it is thought that risk is limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted from feces to the mouth. The virus is most infectious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been shown to have the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that it can be transmitted before severe symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pet and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia who were in contact with a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its characteristics with coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, dissolving its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the genus Coronavirus beta, and is classified under the subgenus of Coronavirus sarbi (strain B) in addition to the two strains originating from bats.
It matches 96% of the entire genome with other samples of the bat-type coronaviruses, Bat-Cove Rat G13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between viruses originating from anthrax eaters and viruses originating from humans.
Comparison of the entire genome so far has revealed a maximum 92 percent genetic sharing between the ant-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the ant-eater is the mediator of the virus.
Virus infection can be tentatively diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is eventually made by reverse transcriptase sequencing (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT scans.
A study in Wuhan that compared polymerase chain reaction to CT showed that CT scan is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although it is less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other disease stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use CT scans to detect COVID-19 or consider them a preliminary screening test for the disease".
The World Health Organization published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, for the first time on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (RT-PCR).
The test can be done on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is usually done with a nasal swab, but a swab from the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing antibody-detecting test tubes.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them have been proven to be accurate enough to be widely adopted.
The serum test developed by SILEX has been approved for emergency use in the United States in approved laboratories only.
Imaging characteristics of radiography and computed tomography (CT) imaging of people with symptoms include asymmetrical lateral blurring such as a cloudy cast glass and a distorted crystalline dispersion.
The Italian Radiological Society compiles an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without polymerase chain reaction is a limited-resolution procedure for detecting COVID-19, because it interferes with other diseases such as glandular virus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of CT scans of the chest with the polymerase chain reaction and proved that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of proving infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it as a screening tool in infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based TNFs have been developed to detect the imaging properties of the virus in both X-ray and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and then discarding it by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those already infected are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned or advised against non-essential travel from and to the affected countries and regions.
However, the virus has reached a stage of spreading throughout the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers, who are caring for a potentially infected person, are advised to use precautions, such as blending precautions and eye protection.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Many mobile phone applications have been designed or launched for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy-conscious solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they come close to someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, rinsing the nose and mouth with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, although many organizations are working to produce a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on the hands, before eating, and after snoring, coughing, or sneezing.
That's because household soap kills the virus outside the body, destroying its immune membrane.
The CDC also recommends using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several detergents (within one minute of applying the detergent to the stainless steel surface), including: 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% iodoprophedon.
There are other detergents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, that are less effective.
The CDC recommends that when someone is suspected of having COVID or confirmed in a facility such as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, and common electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing by either bending their elbows and placing them in front of their mouth and nose or using a tissue and immediately throwing away any tissue.
For those who are at risk, wearing a medical mask is recommended, as wearing a mask reduces the volume and distance of the respiratory spray when it is dispersed by talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce [people's] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if hands are not cleaned properly".
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing non-medical cloth face masks. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially in case of direct contact with people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama made wearing a face mask when outdoors mandatory, while also recommending that face masks be made at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures that aim to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing interpersonal interaction.
The measures include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, sports grounds, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can practice social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting each other without touching, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 outbreak was detected in the area) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
Older adults and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of outbreaks between communities. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began replacing the term "social distancing" with the term "physical distancing", to make clear that the goal is to minimize physical contact with people over social ties, presumably by maintaining social distancing or distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has suggested that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than being encouraged to connect with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations not to have sex unless you live with someone who is not a carrier of the virus or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for COVID-19 infected and suspected infected persons.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those in the most vulnerable groups.
People who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of their next possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling outbreaks are containment or containment and limitation of spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When containment of the disease becomes impossible, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Containment requires more stringent measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproductive count to less than 1. Part of infectious disease outbreak management is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, in what is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overwhelming health services and saves more time for developing vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gathering events; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning of surfaces. More stringent measures aimed at containing the outbreak in China were taken once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as the implementation of citywide quarantine and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screenings and local quarantine, and issued alerts about the movements of infected.
Singapore provided financial support to those who isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and curbed medical supply overcrowding. Simulations of the UK and US show that mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress on health systems.
Inhibition may be preferred but should be maintained as long as the virus is spreading in humans (or until a vaccine becomes available, if this occurs first), as transmission on the other hand reverses quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, treatment may require oxygen, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Many compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" could provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare facilities to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 patients, increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are multiple theories about where the first case originated (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the wholesale Wuhan seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says the virus came from one of these species of animals; or in other words, it has an animal origin. A group with pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan-Bouhan Center for Disease Control on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan that prompted them to begin an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, with the help of mobility during the Chinese New Year and Wuhan becoming a transportation hub and a major railway junction.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later released show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy for the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, there were reportedly over 1.61 million cases worldwide, with over 97,000 people having died and over 364,000 people recovering.
About 200 countries and territories have reported at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (also known as stay-at-home orders, curfew orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, have been under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people have been under lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people have been under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, a number that rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 is December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian noticed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, and her hospital reported the outbreak to the Jianghan-Buhan Disease Control Center on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee issued a public notice on December 31.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In the face of these notifications, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a sweeping campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a health lockdown was declared on January 23 to ban travel to and from Wuhan, which has spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles are banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huchinchan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Lichenchan Hospital, to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health notices to travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken several measures, especially regarding schools and universities.
Measures for remote working have been taken in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed across China.
Public movement has been restricted in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of curfew. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "brought" to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all returning to the city from other countries.On 23 March, one case was locally transmitted in mainland China in the past five days, by a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced the decline in the spread of locally transmitted infections and the control of the outbreak in China.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 the suspension of entry for visa or residence permit holders from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would expire.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30, and provided a package of cash incentives for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the Qing Ming Festival, although the central government demanded that families show their respect online in keeping with physical distancing to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
The transmission of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people or about 13% of the 9,336 churchgoers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest levels of preparedness on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented what is considered the world's largest and best-organized program to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected, and track and quarantine those who have come in contact with them.
Testing methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via a mobile phone app, testing for the virus on people inside their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite not enforcing quarantine on entire cities.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for the ouster of Moon, who has been accused of government abuse during the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries for help testing the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on 19 February in Qom, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and closure of universities, higher education institutes, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit inter-city travel were announced in March, despite heavy inter-city traffic continuing ahead of the Persian New Year of Nowruz.
The Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran during February became the center of the virus spread after China.
Amid allegations of Iran covering up its outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases from Iran starting on February 28, indicating that the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected with the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release also qualified prisoners.

At least 12 current and former Iranian politicians and government officials have died from the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran was registering 50 new cases of the coronavirus every hour, and one death every 10 minutes.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than previously reported.
It is also believed that US sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on 31 January, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of two Chinese tourists in Rome came back positive.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated group of COVID-19 cases were later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a decree on a new law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "He will not be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak areas.
Work and sporting events in those areas have already been ordered to be suspended". On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country as deaths in Italy reached 100 cases.
All major sporting events, including Premier League football matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the halt of almost all business activities, except for supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 cases recovered in Italy, most of these cases were in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggested that a combination of a large number of elderly people and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first appeared to be the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its marked lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising against unnecessary travel or social interaction, proposing people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all leisure facilities such as pubs and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages with a maximum of £2,500 per month to reduce unemployment in a time of crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, with gatherings of more than two people banned and travel and activity outside the home restricted except for extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police through fines and dispersal of gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for "essential" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the leading public health institute of the U.S. government, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down in starting testing, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test spoiled a flawed test kit produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval of non-governmental test kits (by academia, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was required after that).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

The World Health Organization praised the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004, where Chinese authorities were blamed for a blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided "regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to enforce a transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Goodin Gallia noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indicator of a commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated", calling it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission from person to person outside China, and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth public health emergency since the international attention to this measure was turned to during the 2009 coronavirus pandemic.
The WHO director-general said that the outbreak is considered a public health emergency of international concern because of "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have robust health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement".
On 5 February, the WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds set up in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, even if it does appear".
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest person in us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a heavy price later". On 11 February, the World Health Organization, at a press conference, named the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros reported that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to bring "the full potential of the entire UN system into the response".

On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was set up to bring international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in local management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of provincial and city-level response activities, including in urban and rural areas". On 25 February, the WHO announced that "the world needs to do more to prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic", noting that it is too early to describe it as a pandemic, but that countries should be "on alert".
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", which is its highest level for warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for every government on earth: so we must be prepared.
This virus may be on its way and you must be prepared for it", he urged to take the right response measures that can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we basically accept that every person on this planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that the WHO "is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and alarming levels of inactivity". The WHO has faced severe criticism for what it sees as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including delayed declaration of a public health emergency, and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, which had 733,000 signatures as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts reaffirmed respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several CPC executives at the sectoral level have been fired for their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected a previous admission that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The US Donald Trump administration has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China "imposed a cover-up on the news that exacerbated the virus that has now become a global pandemic", which some critics criticize as being racist and "distracting [attention] from its failure to manage to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast got a US government cable reviewing the communications plan from clear sources at the National Security Council, stating strategically that "Everything is about China.
We were asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. "News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of my propaganda drive for global influence.
EU foreign policy official Josep Borrell warned of a "geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of evasion and policies of generosity".
Burrell also said, "China is pushing a message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it is reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
US sanctions banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.

This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian military to send military medics, special sanitation vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American medical equipment and materials manufacturers are active again, they will also be able to return the favor if necessary".

Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary-General Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Defenders Training, saying: "It is in the context of the current public health crisis that the training not only puts the lives of troops from the United States and many European countries involved at risk but also the populations of the countries where it will be conducted". The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament as well as fifteen other former or current political figures infected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal childcare, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predict that this may adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "obscure and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for Moon to be ostracized for allegedly mismanaging the outbreak or praising his response.
Some commentators expressed fears that this would allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for many supply shortages due to the global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply shortages.
Many areas also saw panic buying, leading to shelves becoming empty of basic groceries like food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing a shortage of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delayed shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment could double by 100 times.
This demand has led to prices rising up to twenty times the normal price and also caused a delay in medical supplies of between four and six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent rise in demand for food products, the two regions survived the acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and illicit trafficking of bio-products have succeeded in avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise as industry representatives expect.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to keep stockpiles for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and industrial center, the virus outbreak has been observed to pose a major disruptive threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture of the likely outcomes emerged.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly experienced a "disruption" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, its biggest one-day decline since the financial crisis in 200708.
All three indexes ended the week down more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scop Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained the negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop on March 16.
Many believe a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed Al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and countries.
Central banks are responding faster than they did under the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closing of public places including tourist attractions, and warnings from governments around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and KANTAS, while the UK regional airline, Flybe, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the travel season of the Spring Festival known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments canceled a number of large-scale events, including New Year's Eve celebrations, with private businesses also closing their stores independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail sector globally was affected by store cuts or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also led to a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermometers to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have otherwise.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's roughly 300 million rural migrant workers are trapped in their homes in the inner provinces, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed. The survey by the Angus Read Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers into government-supported short-term work plans known as Kurzarbeit.
France and Britain have adopted the German short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been profoundly affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals - working and freelancing - globally.
The arts and culture sector institutions sought to support their mission (often government-funded) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
As of March 2020, around the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, performances, or postponements cancelled.
In response there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent accelerating repercussions of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which occur during the final week of the Christian season of penance in Lent.
Many parishes have recommended that older Christians stay home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and the cathedral chapel, and emptying St. Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, synagogues, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the outbreak-affected areas and subsequent closure of shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as its residents from entering the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the biggest disruption in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Europa League, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "be rescheduled to beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021". Gambling clubs and other venues around the world were closed and live gambling tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, as many online gambling sites have reported significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various musical groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
Many large theaters like the one on Broadway have also suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live concerts or creating online "celebrations" for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Many internet memes about the coronavirus have spread on the web, with many turning into humor and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world towards Chinese people as deserving of the virus or receiving what was allegedly a justified punishment.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for Chinese people both online and offline, and for those living in the areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak spread to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may be exposed to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed pressure petitions to bar Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan# is being used on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and the US reported increasing levels of racial abuse, as well as assaults.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term that critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, who study in major Indian cities have faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the BJP's West Bengal unit Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God has avenged them".
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comments, calling them "wrong". In China, the pandemic led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" and targeted "for disposal".
Many newspapers have removed subscription-based pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made outbreaks-related scientific papers available for open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and its related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus by identifying antibodies that produce a response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in samples, detecting the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 ribose DNA.
Used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (semantics) is used to diagnose and monitor populations.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who had no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population in March 2020.
On March 23, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a big variation in the number of tests done across countries.
This disparity is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported death rates, which in some countries may be greatly overestimated.
Reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to screen respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including nasal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR, which is done using throat scans, is only relied upon in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are screened in the second week, a deep airway sample may instead be taken by suction catheter or cough drops (pellets).
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using instantaneous reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a PCR-based, safe, clinically suitable SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its own RT-PCR-based diagnostic board for the novel coronavirus 2019 (NCoV-2019) to public health laboratories through the International Detection Materials Supply Authority.
One of the three genetic tests on older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to defective detectors, and one phase of testing was delayed by others at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in testing fewer than 100 samples a day on average successfully throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not trusted until February 28, 2020, and until then, state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The FDA approved the test under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting the tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a nationwide RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling and processing must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research developed and produced the COVID-19 test Victor.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Supervision Service (FHS) registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Rosh Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform nearly 4,128 tests over 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hologic, LapCorp, and Thermosoul Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cifid received similar emergency use authorisation from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses thermal equation amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because this doesn't require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to ramp up production to perform 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a single-stranded antibody that specifically binds to the novel coronavirus's nucleotide protein (N-protein), in the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "X-rays of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may be clear even before symptoms appear".
Typical features seen in CT imaging include bi-sided, multi-banded, cased glass blinds with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
It develops under the armpit and shows irregular patches and intensifies as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan City comparing PCR and CT imaging with respect to the origin of the current epidemic indicated that PCR is more sensitive than PCR, although it is less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other disease stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "not to use CT scans to detect COVID-19 or consider them a primary screening test for diagnosis". In March 2020, the CDC recommended using PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect individuals within 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immunity, and in case of population monitoring. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-clinical care testing (POCT).
High-performance automated systems in many clinical labs will be able to perform these analyses, but how available they are will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central labs, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although sequential samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For the point of clinical care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn through a skin piercing.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step does not need to be performed before screening. On March 26, 2020, the FDA identified 29 parties that had notified the agency according to the requirements and so these parties could distribute what they had of antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test can take several hundred samples in hours and is therefore much faster than traditional PCR analysis of viral ribose DNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody testing kits they had purchased were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives a sample tube to patients", spit in the tube, and return it again to get the test result after a short period. The UK National Health Service announced that it is piloting a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus ruling out the risk of transmission of infection from the infected when they arrive at the hospital or the need to sterilize the ambulance used.
South Korea's in-car testing centers have enabled the fastest and most comprehensive set of tests in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Forensic Medical Insurers said on March 2 that it was able to conduct about 12,000 tests a day for outpatients and tested 10,700 people last week.
The health insurance covers the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-car virus tests became available in many major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive cases were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method to test samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and underwent that method, by collecting samples and not conducting further testing unless the cohort sample is positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened a temporary emergency detection laboratory with an area of 2,000 square meters called "Yan-Huo Eye" (Fuo Yan-Huo, or Fire Eye in Chinese) today, which can screen more than 10,000 samples in 2020.
With Wang Jian, founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to do it, the modeling showed that cases in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capacity was not achieved.
The Wuhan lab was immediately followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 detection using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be utilized in small labs without the need for automated fluid processors.
In March, scarcity and inadequate detectors caused a bottleneck when conducting a large number of tests in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free up the ribose DNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is among the world's top countries in terms of the proportion of its population testing for coronavirus, and is on track to raise the level of testing to reach most of the population.
This was through a combination of activating in-car testing capability, and purchasing a population-scale, super-productive lab from Group 42 and BGI (based on their own emergency detection labs "Huo-Yan" in China).
The lab was set up in 14 days, and it allows for tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, and it's the first lab of this size in the world operating outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus's genetic traits have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German plan to manufacture kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to invent their own kits.
The German plan was announced on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, delaying the tests available in the US. China and the US have faced issues regarding the reliability of early-outbreak testing kits, and these countries and Australia have not been able to provide sufficient kits to meet demand and follow the recommendations for testing provided by health experts.
In contrast, experts stated that the abundance of testing in South Korea helped to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has significantly enhanced testing capacity in private laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing programs as the optimal solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased testing demand due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and the supply of scanners and chemical detectors has dwindled.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, "defects" were found in the test kits created by the CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test from being done privately. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or to not using the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw from the purchase of kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested dumping them in the Danube River. Professor Ahsoka Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and had been "prohibited from use". The UK also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unfit for use.
The tests, followed by quarantine of confirmed cases and follow-up of those who mixed with SARS-CoV-2, produced positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vauxhall, which saw the first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about ten days each time.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the inter-city curfew, new cases have been completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decrease in the spread rate compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments; through strict contact tracing and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore already began urging residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on schedule after the holiday ended.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent lockdowns, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study revealed that countries that did more testing, as opposed to more deaths, had much lower death rates, perhaps because those countries were better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first 10 negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the column "Positive % of tests" is affected by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only for people admitted to hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests its entire population, whether they have symptoms or not, all other factors being equal.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands regularly with soap at certain "essential times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the anal-oral route.
People can also get respiratory diseases such as flu or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important include before and after defecating, after cleaning the baby's butt or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry, and after.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash.
Before, during and after the meal.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a child's diaper or cleaning it after using the toilet.
After you wipe your nose, or cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, their food, or their feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who work in food or medical fields, but it is also an important measure for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
And lower the infant mortality rate at home births.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing practices may lead to slight improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50 percent.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea attacks by almost a third, which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the reduction in diarrhea attacks can be linked to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) when applying automated behaviour in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the number one cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet an intrinsic habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes.
Hand washing also protects against smallpox that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A simple harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of peeling and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Overwashing is also often seen as a symptom of OCD.
There are five essential times of the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of infections through the oral route: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the baby's butt (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing should be done in other situations to prevent transmission of disease, such as before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is declining.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate at an estimated 97%, the United States is close to the middle at 77%, and China has the lowest at 23%. There are now many behavior change methodologies to increase the use of hand washing with soap at times when necessary.
The Philippines' Department of Education's Primary Health Care Program is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Worm treatment twice a year, along with daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride brushing, are at the heart of this national program.
It's been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergents to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to decomposition, and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective for skin because fats and proteins, the building blocks of organic soil, do not easily break down in water.
However, the flow of the right amount of water helps to purify...
Because of its reusable nature, hard soap may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transmission from contaminated hard soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because the bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends that "liquid soap is preferable to non-touchable soap pumps".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted by health-conscious consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of organisms.
So if antibacterial soap doesn't affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it's marketed.
In addition to a surface stress reducer and a skin protector, the evolved formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as acid regulators, active antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (cactus, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that regular soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan at preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water for hand washing isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap at removing natural oils that hold back dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based, rub-sterilized alcohol hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand wash, disinfectant hand wash or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compounded with a thickening agent such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
Addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol sterilizers by rubbing kill bacteria, drug-resistant polybacterium (methycillin-resistant golden staph and vancomycin-resistant gut bacteria), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cytovirus, nasal viruses, smallpox, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol-containing sterilizers with 70% alcohol by rubbing kill 99.97% (logarithmic decrease of 3.5, similar to a 35 dB decrease) of bacteria on hands after 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic decrease of 4 to 5) of bacteria on hands after 1 minute of application. Hand sterilizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of gastrointestinal infection. Enough hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all fingers and their limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
Wash your fingertips thoroughly and rub them in both wrists. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with hand sanitizer, especially when hands are noticeably dirty.
The increasing use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and quick activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless water and soap are not available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless raincoats, moisturizers, or both are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other precipitates or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing raincoats cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial cleansers.
Allergic dermatitis, allergic rickets syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol-based handwashes are rare.
The lower incidence of irritant dermatitis has become a major attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of non-water-based hand sanitizers, they do not cleanse the hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically has been significantly less effective than alcohol-containing ones that rely on alcohol rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol which has been shown to decrease in effectiveness after repeated use, perhaps due to gradual adverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a purifier because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommends using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
Proper hand washing recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Soak your hands in warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing pools may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make a foam on your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods of time removes more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Washing hands in the sink can re-contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most commonly overlooked parts are the thumb, wrist, interfinger areas, and under the nails.
Flexible nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
Using a moisturizer is often recommended to prevent dry hands, as dry skin can damage it, which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate handwashing in developing countries, where tap water, soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a hanging pot or drilling holes with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as "Tippy tap" and other low-cost options.
Tippy tap is a simple technique that uses a jar suspended from a rope, and a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is a key part of hand hygiene, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public restrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Seminar on the Paper Towel Industry, to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers, and newer air-jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by an average of 194 percent and on the palm of the hand by 254 percent.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreased on average by up to 76% and on the palm by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of transmission of infection to other toilet users and the environment of the toilet as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of hands and equipment, and may transmit infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and they compare hand dryers to paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel as soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory for a long time after the Hungarian physician Agnats Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that using it reduced the incidence of infection.
Medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers crossed.
If there is debris under the fingernails, a brush with rough hair can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contaminating the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare setting is to remove disease-causing microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routinely before touching patients, transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization published a paper that illustrates how to wash and rub hands in health care settings.
The draft hand hygiene guideline provided by the organisation can also be found on its website and is available for public comment.
Whitby and others did a related review.
Commercial machines can measure and check hand hygiene, if it is necessary to prove compliance with regulations.
The WHO has a five-minute rule for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids.
Before a sterilization mission, and
After patient care. Adding disinfected chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antibacterial") adds a lethal ingredient to hand washing agent.
This element of eradication may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widely spread. When someone "rubs" their hand for surgery, a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching it with their hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile rubbing brush, and another sterile tool for cleaning under the nails are required.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from bouncing from the armpits to the hands.
After washing the hands, dry them with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control cluster cell infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand sanitization was found to come from the first 20 percent of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when hand sanitization frequency increased to more than 35 percent.
Washing with ordinary soap leads to more than three times the rate of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing rubbing hands with an alcohol solution with washing hands with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol rubbing was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and difficult hand-to-hand diarrhea. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, there is a consensus that handwashing with soap is a cost-effective tool for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to achieve general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, you rarely find handwashing faucets near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates could be due to inherent habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term population behavior change.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to three stars eventually.
Building handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are trying to bring about behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an expressive handwashing symbol.
Few studies have looked at the effectiveness of the total cost of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that soap-based handwashing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people going through critical conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Agnats Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing".
Most people at the time still thought the infection was due to bad smells called miasma.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more effective hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, signs with "proper ways to wash hands" have been hung next to hand wash basins in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands of" something means a declaration that one does not wish to take responsibility for something or participate in complicity in it.
It originates from a passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader usage in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins washing her hands excessively in an attempt to cleanse a fictional stain representing her guilt over the crimes she committed and the crimes her husband incited her to commit.
It was also found that people, after pointing out or thinking about immoral actions, tend to wash their hands more than others, and tend to value handwashing tools more.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to wash their hands after this study were less likely to participate in other compensatory "cleansing" procedures, such as volunteering.
The religions describe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without the presence of soap to wash hands, is part of a hand washing ritual that has appeared in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tevilah, hand washing in Judaism, and washing in Christianity and enlightenment in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after every meal.
Controls for COVID-19 risks in the workplace
Occupational COVID-19 risk controls are the implementation of occupational safety and health risk controls to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The correct controls for workplace risk control are based on the workplace and job assignment, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be at risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which it is recommended to apply basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette, and maintaining the usual practices of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Jobs with moderate exposure risks include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19, but may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, labour-intensive work environments, and some large-scale retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, anti-sneezing barriers, and use of personal protective equipment available in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers healthcare and mortuary workers who are exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person to be at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of very high exposure if workers perform airborne haze procedures, collect or handle samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 person.
Appropriate controls to control the risks to these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects on the workplace.
Workers may miss work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of goods sought and the ways of obtaining them (e.g. shopping outside rush hour, via delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographically heavily affected areas of COVID-19 may be halted. An Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing transmission of infection among employees, protecting those most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
Because the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
PPE is less effective than engineering and management controls, but it can help prevent some exposure sites.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected based on the risk to the worker, the correct fit as needed (e.g. respirators), worn continuously and correctly, checked, maintained and replaced regularly, as necessary, and removed, cleaned, stored, or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less exposure to risk involve minimal interaction with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and trash cans, being prepared to work remotely or sequentially if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay at home until fever, fever signs, and any other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, that employees be allowed to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, occupations with moderate exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19, but may contract SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission of infection in the community surrounding the workplace, or because the person recently made international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is spreading.
This includes workers who come into contact with the general public such as in schools, labor-intensive work environments, and some large-scale retail locations. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the vehicle. Administrative controls and high-risk groups therefore include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, initiating meetings to address and predict infectious incidents, establishing organized work shifts on an immediate basis, using less frequent work situations to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and using more effective workplace practices to prevent and prevent situations in which workers may be exposed to the virus, including the development of new workplace or workplace safety, access to personal or family resources, and other important factors, including the prevention of illness, workplace hazards, the use of personal protective equipment, and the development of safety and security measures, including measures to prevent, prevent, prevent, and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the use of personal protective equipment, including protective clothing and equipment, to protect workers from the risks of exposure to the workplace, and other factors, including the risk of exposure to the workplace, and the environment, and the environment, and the environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on board an aircraft, appropriate preventive controls to protect staff and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger 6 feet away from others, assigning one member of the flight crew to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in the biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial cargo, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk control controls include postponing travel in case of illness, self-isolation and immediately notifying the onboard medical center if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person is in the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is a limited to moderate community transmission limit, social distancing strategies such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, band classes, or eating meals at the cafeteria, increasing the distance between offices, organizing successive attendance and check-out times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms can be implemented.
When there is significant community transmission of infection, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school departure times may be considered. For law enforcement personnel who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of direct contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect belts and work equipment before re-use with a household cleaning spray or mop, follow standard work procedures for handling contamination, dispose of used personal protective equipment, and collect and wash clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers that some healthcare and mortuary workers fall into the categories with high or very high exposure levels.
High-risk jobs include healthcare providers, support, laboratories, and medical transportation workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become extremely high-risk if workers perform airborne haemorrhage procedures, as well as collect samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients or deal with them.
Aerosol generation procedures include tubing, cough induction procedures, rectal scans, some dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive specimens.
Functions of a high-risk morgue include workers who are involved in preparing the bodies of people who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become at a very high level of risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, including when performing aerial haemorrhage procedures.
Specialised passive pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and body storage.
Samples should be handled with level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating arriving patients in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those working 6 feet away from known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95-filtered respirators, certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better, must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. The WHO does not recommend the use of condoms, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO recommends that only surgical masks be worn by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, care for them, or transport them without any airborne genesis procedures, the WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, syrup, and gloves.
If a vacuum generation procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuing to use the same respiratory mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis and monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, while using masks for individuals who are not showing symptoms.

We've found ourselves in the middle of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a stark demonstration of global human connection and our responsibilities to others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the well-established elements at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a stunning practical proof of the amazing human emotion that surrounds, fortunately, the way we do business.
I feel deep gratitude and deep pride that you are such true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is that the world is moving towards Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism of this very important resource staying online and welcoming to all individuals.
Your efforts have made this possible, whether it's keeping the sites running, getting our colleagues paid, or keeping our communities safe.
The world is in dire need of information available on Wikipedia more than ever.
It's a moment when the positive impact on the world is not just about the efforts we make, but also about the way we do them.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're making major changes to how we work together starting next week.
Changes to working methods and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought might be the appropriate response to what we're facing, and the ideal way to keep the business of the foundation sustainable during this time.
We were very eager to eliminate stress and stress, and support our mission in the long term.
If you want to reduce the burden and the tasks, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday, so if you're able to work longer than normal, you can add your effort to the task.
However, the world is becoming more unpredictable right now, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones or get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We're not keeping track of your times.
If you're sick, you don't work.
Allowing this should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it emphatically.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, just inform your manager and help your team to check the calendars and schedules to make sure that the main work areas are covered.
(If your doctor diagnoses you with COVID-19, please tell Brian at the Department of Training and Certification so that the Department of Training and Certification can help provide support and ensure that you receive appropriate care from the Department.)
The hourly workers get their full pay.
We've already mentioned that, and we renew that commitment with our obligations to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Each employee will receive his/her salary according to normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we're here for you.
Many individuals are using work to overcome the pressures of the world around us.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially in times of crisis like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask that you contact your manager so that he can find out what to expect and adjust the procedures accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
And there are some things we have to keep going.
The reliability engineering teams, HR, trust, integrity, fundraising (and others) processes are doing a critical job, which may need more support.
We will begin a process of working with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to accomplish our mission.
There's a lot of work we all have to do, and we're just going to focus on the most important projects.
Taking it slow now won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to "double down on work to make up for lost time" after the pandemic is over.
We're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines when appropriate.
What happens in the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and daily work hours expectations, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time to budget to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while aligning those who need or want to work within a reduced work schedule, over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule relieves the current planning workload and pressure across the entire organization.
We'll submit our proposal to the board next week and we'll inform delegates and teams of updates on next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning.
We learned last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and restraint, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to clean all surfaces in our San Francisco office.
The team used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its duty of care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is conveniently ready until the time we decide to go back to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is located in a building owned by WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and with all team members at our headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to a completely remote location under the same direction as our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for a while.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be a adjustment, and they've wanted to give you some advice:
The meeting time should be set at a maximum of one hour or gradually increased to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, you should think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly scheduled, the agenda prepared and the reading material sent in advance.
Video should be the default solution, and tools like Google Docs and Zoom should be used to facilitate collaboration and live communication.
The initiative should be to facilitate each meeting, with someone monitoring the conversation to find out questions and track the list of speakers, and someone else to help take notes (or implement a collaborative note-taking process).
Technical support should be contacted by e-mail if you need a comfortable headset.
The Health and Safety Compensation Scheme can be used to cover the cost of snacks.
You can join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR operations team is looking for user-friendly, online-based meeting-based guidance to support the increase in distributed work across our organization.
Over the past week, we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Editathon web site editors' events until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions might make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no one would be fined for having to delay or adjust these goals.
We will be releasing additional follow-up guidance next week on Wikimedia and other regional and community-specific conferences.
The general feelings that dominate the global community are mixed between grief over the disorder, satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In light of the progress of these actions, the Crisis Response Team is working on designing a page on MetaWiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all communications with it.
Stay informed about COVID-19-related topics
We'll be sending out an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for the task force meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time networking.
We're going through this together and we're always ready to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, we can continue to get information from this email, and all other necessary COVID-19-related information available on the WikiOffice.
The crisis response team will keep these pages updated and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers in the worst affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please feel free to let us know and cooperate with the Crisis Response Team.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACT2) inhibits ACE by decreasing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry point for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallic enzyme that is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The angiotensin-2 enzyme-converting protein contains an M2 peptidease domain with an amino end, and a colectrine carboxyl end chain that is a carrier of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 monoclonal membrane protein, with active enzyme receptors found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular region of the angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme is separated from the transmembrane region by an enzyme called shidases, which releases a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then into the urine.
The angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme is found in most organs: it binds to the cell membrane of type 2 lymphocytes in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, and in the endothelial cells of arteries and veins, as well as in smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall in most organs.
The RNA that transfers the enzyme to angiotensin 2 is found in the cerebral cortex, the stratum corneum, the subarachnoid region, and the brainstem.
The primary function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is to act as a balancer of angiotensin-converting enzyme.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, which binds to blood vessels.
In contrast, the angiotensin-2 conversion enzyme separates the carboxyl endpoint containing the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-brolin-phenylalanine) and breaks it down into angiotensin (1-7), which is a carboxyl endpoint containing the amino acid phenylalanine-isoleucine-histidine-brolin-phenylalanine.
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme breaks down into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9] - bradykinin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and gerlin.
The angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral, homologous amino acid transporter SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartt-Biedl disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, as a transmembrane protein, is the main cell entry for some coronaviruses, which include human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binding to the enzyme domain of angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme on the cell surface leads to cellular repair and the transfer of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the S protein to be synthesized by a membrane-bound protease enzyme, host serine2, which is still being inactivated as a potential treatment. This leads some to speculate that lowering the levels of the angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a markedly reduced risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia decreased among patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in pneumonia deaths, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is thought that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) will be a novel treatment for acute lung injury. It has been found to improve pulmonary blood circulation, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with multi-fat-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while its activity begins after 30 minutes, and its activity (period) continues for up to 24 hours.
There is considerable evidence to suggest that the conversion enzyme may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to traditional angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases accompanied by elevated blood levels of angiotensin 2. There are clinical trials under evaluation, on the effect of the conversion enzyme pumping in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are software applications for mobile devices specifically designed to help track people in contact as part of the response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some jurisdictions and regions.
There are many frameworks for designing contact tracing applications.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on geolocation tracking of app users.
Less privacy-invasive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they had integrated a feature that supports these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It's an app that people use in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, people use an app called TraceTogether.
A local IT association has taken over the design of the app, released it as an open source app and is due to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched the "!StopKorona" app, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to contact with potentially infected individuals and provide a rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in cooperation with the Ministry of Health took over the design of the app.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that a contact tracing app was in advanced development and could be available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, StopCovid.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering developing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app, as well as the BlueTree.Net protocol. Russia is planning to launch an app that uses geographic virtual environments for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by doctors from Moscow residents, designed to ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and potential ineffectiveness if applications are used only by a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their own coronavirus-related apps to its app store; limiting this to only "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus apps, particularly regarding whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance should be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include provisions on when to stop them;
Data should be used only for COVID-19-related purposes;
The security of data and the confidentiality of the identity of their owners should be protected and their protection proven on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be determined in law;
The protection of the rights of citizens to combat abuse and the protection of the rights of others should be ensured.
"Active participation" from all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued review lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of constant surveillance by removing tracking from device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of using apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing for the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to raw data of locations have potential big privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for inter-communications (see next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-app-based system to implement contact tracing.
Instead of using a custom app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transactions, and incorporates this data to send SMS notifications to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential culprits, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of the MERS-CoV in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries, such as Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, no details have been released.
Privacy-conscious contact tracing is a well-established and successful concept and is supported by strong research literature dating back to at least 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked to come up with privacy-compliant solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BPP-PT was a coordinated effort with both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include privacy-preserving decentralized approach tracking (DPBT/DPT-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as call event numbers, CENs), privacy-sensitive protocols, and mobile contact tracking (PACT) mechanisms, among others.
In these protocols, no personally identifiable data leaves the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab was working on SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location or path intersection data and leveraging them to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research drawn from the report "The Bad Face of Apps: Maintaining Personal Privacy Under the Pandemic" released in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company also originally originated at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share location and health-sensitive data with users and other administrators without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global Contact Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was a fundamentally similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and enabling global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature for achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the Blue Trace protocol, used by the official government app, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced a contact tracing initiative; they claimed they would maintain privacy by relying on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three phases, namely:
Developing tools to enable governments to create privacy-conscious official apps to track the coronavirus.
Integrating this functionality directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve the ongoing usability and monitoring issues by distributing systems first through operating system updates and then by removing them in the same way once the threat is over.
Drug re-purposing (also known as reuse, re-assignment, re-targeting, or therapeutic transformation of a drug) is the re-purposing of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than it was originally designed to treat.
This is one of the scientific research methods that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and refined plasma transport. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each containing multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these link sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 are the important protease, ribose-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S-protein, and adenosine diphosphate ribophosphate.
Hussain A. A., et al. have studied several candidate compounds that have subsequently undergone improvement and analysis for structural similarity to approved drugs with higher similarity and this in order to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 antibody in their preclinical study to recommend it in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that doctors also use to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs under study as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is licensed under the Emergency Use License only as an experimental treatment for emergency use to treat patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it has not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its treatment, doses or duration".
Doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
There are big studies at Duke and Oxford.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that faviprovir was "clearly effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative for an average of 4 days, while the illness duration was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given faviferovir and the other half ominovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to add to its stockpile, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to become pregnant.
One study using lupinavir/ritonavir (CALITRA), a combination of lupinavir and ritonavir antivirals, reported that the results "found no benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is facing a case of criticism over the redirection of resources to the redefinition of the purposes of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
Lupinavir/Ritonavir has been added to the international solidarity trial by the WHO.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in the laboratory against several threatviruses, mucosal viruses and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is that it develops resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials currently underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving patients with moderate disease, and the other for patients with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials on vitamin C antiviral on hospitalized patients with severe illness due to COVID-19, as well as two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began trials on the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Teijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A phase II trial using a form of angiotensin-2 transformer enzyme is currently underway on 200 patients who are required to join the trial from acute hospitalizations in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without needing to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women, breastfeeding women or women who do not have an effective contraceptive are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study in Italy of 300 patients to investigate the use of anoxacarin sodium in both prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a great deal of scientific attention has focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as SARS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommended the use of ribavirin for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Ominovir: Specialists recommended the use of ominovir for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor): approved by China.
The trials in Italy and China are also.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a supposed vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, there are several attempts underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition's Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Initiative for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the early 2020s to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that advanced to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxygenated ribose DNA and ribose DNA) (developer of the first phase and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer of Phase I and candidate vaccine: Moderna, and glandular virus carrier type 5)
As scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations reported in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information available (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase one and phase two trials are a preliminary safety and abstinence test, usually randomized, controlled in a child, in multiple sites, with more precise and effective doses determined.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and a test of the vaccine's effectiveness to prevent disease, with the adverse effects of the optimal dose monitored.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under "preclinical" research).
On or about 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the feasibility of a molecular covalent vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Equipment Command at Fort Derrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had teamed up with Novavax Inc.
In developing and manufacturing a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for preclinical trials and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with the acceleration of work it would take at least a year and a half to almost two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it was developing a coronavirus-like particle partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans to test it on humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "substantial sums of money" for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had demanded.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to participate in the development of a vaccine based on the transferred ribose DNA.
The BNT162 candidate, a ribose-DNA-based carrier vaccine, is currently undergoing preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the final candidate vaccine could begin to have human trials by autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 Vaccine Research Consortium that includes Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Alliance investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
The partners of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying ribose DNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures against COVID-19, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, reporting that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines given by microscopic needling elicited strong antibody-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were apparent as early as 2 weeks post-vaccination".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on deoxygenated ribose DNA as a potential nasal spray.
Using the pathogens, the oxygen-deficient ribose DNA would engineer the human bacteria to regenerate to produce harmless virus-like particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access the giant computers from IBM, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have opposite effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means it can have benefits beyond the disease you're fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia sought to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as mice genetically modified with the angiotensin-2 transgenic enzyme, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for Level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against MERS.
When Mars spread, it was believed that the research based on SARS could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against Mars-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (oxygen-deficient ribose-DNA-based) that had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines were in development, all of which were virus-targeted vaccines, glandular virus-targeted vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-targeted vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts raised a conspiracy theory that claims the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as the coronavirus that causes SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people in 210 countries and territories were reported infected, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during intercourse, often through spraying when coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
When spray is scattered during the exhalation process, it usually falls to the ground or surfaces instead of being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of instantaneous reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a nasal swab.
Masks are recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Some authorities recommend against, some discourage, and some require masks.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is advised if you develop emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, discomfort, difficulty waking up, or blueness of the face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be noted.
Digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed at varying rates.
At first, some cases in China only suffered from chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called the nursery period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports suggest that symptoms may not appear in all infected individuals.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who are asymptomatic is currently unknown and under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases are asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began listing asymptomatic cases in the daily tally on April 1; of the 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic on testing.
Sputum and toys can carry high levels of the virus.
It's more of a spray of talking out loud than it is of talking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without a mouth covering can result in a spray that spreads out to a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted via bioavailability, and testing of samples from air complexes in the lobby outside people's rooms has resulted in positive results for viral ribose DNA.
Some medical procedures such as CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and the virus can then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, it is thought that the risk is limited. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; and while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three more people in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to persist for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene), stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; they dissolve the protective lipid membrane of the virus and stop it working, as well as clearing the skin and other surfaces of the virus.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after being transported to the hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of testing, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the acute respiratory syndrome group in Wuhan.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 shares characteristics with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, household soap kills the virus, destroying its immune membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II lymphocytes in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had severe heart attacks, and it was more common in critical cases.
The rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in its function.
The incidence of clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in ICU patients with COVID-19 may be related to poor prognosis. Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 found diffuse renal damage (DAD), and inflammatory filtration containing lymphocytes within the lung.
Despite SARS-CoV-2 targeting EC2 epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that disease-causing GM-CSF-secreting T cells are associated with bringing single-cell interleukin-6-secreting inflammatory and pulmonary inflammatory disease in COVID-19 patients.
There's also a report of lymphatic artery disease at the autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard test method.
The test is usually done with a breath sample taken from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but that requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart and the results are of simple immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70 percent.
The first clinical point-of-care test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University Chongnan Hospital suggested methods to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Stained glass blinds are bi-lateral, multi-lobed with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior spread common features in early injury.
A sublateral spread and a form of stony plaque may appear (thickness of the platelet barrier with uneven sinus filling) and fuse with the progression of the disease.
There is little data on the microbial and pathophysiological pathogens of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions from the autopsy:
Microscopy: sinusitis, tumor, pulmonary edema and swelling of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, overexpansion of lung cells, abnormal large syncytial cells, and endothelial inflammation with lymphedema and the formation of giant cells with many nuclei
Acute pneumonia: diffuse synovial dysfunction (DAD) with diffuse synovial discharge.
Widespread spinal damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in the sinus cavities and pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and using the inside of your elbow if a tissue is not available.
It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, partly to limit transmission from people without symptoms. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are noticeably dirty, before eating, and after cleaning their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when only soap and water are not available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO offers two locally produced recipes.
The antimicrobial activity in these two compounds originates from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill the bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a simple face mask.
ECMO is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and pulmonologists in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from a variety of organizations in a free resource, an online critical care book.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 was available.
For symptoms, some specialists recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as a first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that may produce a spray, such as tubing or hand breathing.
For healthcare professionals caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions.The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment: personal protective equipment, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. It is best to use respirators (instead of face masks) when available.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of masks under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is uncertain if used for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or homemade masks, as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not so severe that they require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to those with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for those in hospitals is under active study, with some evidence that tubing can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal passage or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options will provide the same benefit to those with a critical illness.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas-operated respiration when available because this technique limits the spread of vapour particles compared to high-flow nasal ventilation. Critical cases are more common among the elderly (over 60 years of age, especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for their population, limiting the health system's ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of high-risk COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, nearly 30% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 patients and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure control modes and a high positive terminal z-pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respirator-related lung injury and chest rest.
High positive terminal cKD may not be available in older respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs under trial have already been approved for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with a critical medical condition.
The World Health Organization recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted a temporary license to use purified plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is critically or immediately threatened.
It hasn't been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to prove that it's safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'contactors' using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. It uses big data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence to track infected and contacted people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security services to track mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who might come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the collected phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research purposes and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Mr. Giulio Galera stated that mobile phone companies told him that "40% of people are still on the move everywhere".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend in which more than 42,000 people took part.
The President of Estonia, Kirsty Kalliolaid, also issued a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel uncomfortable about quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the injury itself.
The BBC reported that Rory O'Connor said: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a major storm that is damaging people's mental health and wellbeing".
The disease may be mild with mild symptoms or no symptoms, as in other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to become severely infected with COVID-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19. COVID-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, infectious trauma or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include infection, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized were diagnosed with an abnormality of blood clotting, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% had impaired kidney function.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of liver enzymes (amino transporters).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in the hospital.
However, the average time between admission to the hospital and death for those transferred to the ICU was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average time from onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the overall incidence ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent while the female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.
Postmortem tissue autopsy of lung samples shows widespread tooth decay with cellular fibroxide secretions in both lungs.
Changes in viral cellular dysfunction have been observed in the lymphocytes.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to elevated troponin levels or heart attack was observed in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of the region may also affect the deaths.
Estimates of deaths from the condition vary due to these differences between regions, but also due to systemic difficulties.
The reduced limitation of minor cases may lead to a higher estimate of mortality than is true.
However, the fact that previous injuries cause deaths may suggest that the current death rate is lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 symptoms, require intensive care and 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about long-term complications of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent shrinkage in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung tests indicated damage to the lungs.
It can also cause post-concussion syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections gained recovered patients effective and long-lasting immunity.
Acquisition of immunity is considered a possibility, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases of recovering from COVID-19 and subsequently being reinfected.
He believes that these cases worsen if the infection persists more than if it recurs.
He believes the virus is natural and of animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely the result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date for the onset of symptoms.
Official publications from the World Health Organization reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date for the onset of symptoms.
There are usually several measures to determine the death toll.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) assigned the emergency code U 07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U 07.2 to COVID-19 deaths diagnosed with clinical or epidemic SARS-CoV-2 without laboratory-confirmed virus infection. The ratio of deaths from infections is expressed as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate from infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other metrics include case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people who are detected and die from a disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people who are infected (detected and undetected) and who die from a disease.
These statistics have no time frame, and they follow a specific population from the infection to the fate of the condition.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected individuals, their presence may provide information about how many are infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castelloni d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Janglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively lower death rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system is not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, maybe about 3 percent have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) deaths have been confirmed from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate differ between men and women.
The mortality rate was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest for men at age 50, with the difference between men and women disappearing at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, and men's co-infection with conditions like high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that Co is an abbreviation for Corona, and in abbreviation for Virus, and the abbreviation for Disease and 19 refers to the year the outbreak was first discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in general data.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of the names Novel Coronavirus-2019 and Novel Coronavirus-associated acute respiratory illness-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines prohibiting the use of locations in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies are exporting healthcare materials like nasal scans and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier couldn't deliver on time, a local startup reverse engineered and produced the required 100 valves overnight.
After the first COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation regarding the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread quickly on the Internet.
It seems humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus replicating in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines for the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the WHO launched a "Solidarity trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that are most promising.
No vaccine is available, but various bodies are actively working on developing candidate vaccines.
They're using previous studies on SARS-CoV because it's similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three pollination strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the SpikeS protein that helps the virus penetrate ACE2 receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA pigments or ribose DNA vaccines, a new technology for vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines produced by any of these strategies must be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent amplification has been pointed out as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved treatments for malaria have been conducted, including four studies involving hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The proposed antiviral drugs to be reused in the treatment of the new disease make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of Remdesivir across several countries and results to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs was conducted as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/ritonavir, and lupinavir/itonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is preliminary evidence of remdesivir's effectiveness, as of March 2020.
A clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with Remdesivir for in vitro use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virological Research points out that despite the recommended one gram dose, underdosing is extremely dangerous and can cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines also includes interferon, ripevirin or omyfenovir for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms is recommended after its inhibition of low-concentration SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated. Studies have shown that the initial configuration of the spike protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have involved significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Oceltamovir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in late-stage acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. The National Health Commission of China added tussilizumab to its treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non-randomized trial at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe medical conditions.
In addition to being used in serum virinin testing to identify cytokine storms, it aims to counteract such developments, which are thought to cause death in some infected.
The FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor T-cell therapy for the K-receptor, based on retrospective case studies, for the treatment of steroid-responsive non-cytokine-secretion syndrome of a different cause in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The method of transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 recovering patients to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccination method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Virus neutralization represents the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can act as a defense mediator against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms may be employed, such as antibody-based cellular toxicity or swallowing or both.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of the serum of the viruses, which is made up of the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased to spread it faster.
Coronaviruses, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later became ill and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
