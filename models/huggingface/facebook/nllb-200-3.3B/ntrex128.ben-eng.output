Welsh Assembly Members worried about looking like 'Muppet'
There is concern amongst many Assembly members about changing their titles to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this panic is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Wesch Parliament.
Members of the assembly from various political parties feared that they would face ridicule over the name change.
A Labour Assembly member said his party was concerned that "the new title is in sync with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means mole.
A Plaid Assembly member said they were "not happy" as a group and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "open-minded" about the name change but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Mappett.
In this sense, the Welsh letter W sounds like the Yorkshire English letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently enacting the regulation to start the name change process, said: "The final decision on the details of the term of office of the Assembly members must be taken by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change their names.
In June the Commission published the results of a public opinion poll in which the Assembly's proposal to rename it the Welsh Parliament received broad support.
As for the ranking of Assembly members, the Commission is backed by the Welsh Members of Parliament, or WMPs, but the MWP has the most support in the public.
Apparently, Assembly members are suggesting different options, but reaching consensus will be difficult for the presiding officer, Elaine Jones, who is due to submit draft legislation in a few weeks.
The reforms will include changes to the Assembly procedure including disqualification of Assembly members and design of committee mechanisms.
After the debate on the provision, the Assembly members will have the opportunity to cast a final vote on what their title should be.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held to avoid a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a symbol of its claims to territory, and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Giorgos Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, feel that the name change is just a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bell is silent as Harlem's churches are blasted
"The elderly people I have spoken to say that historically there was a church and a pub on every corner", Mr Adams said.
"There is none today".
He said that the pub's disappearance was understandable.
Today, "people communicate in different ways".
"Panshala is no longer the neighborhood living room where everyone goes on a regular basis".
As for the church, he is worried that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, and that, whether today or tomorrow, it will return to where it started.
He added that apartments and condominiums could be built on the church site to house all the people who would not be supporting the other churches in the area.
"The majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and they will accelerate the closure of these churches because most of the people who come to live in these condominiums are unlikely to be church members".
Both churches were founded by white congregations before Harlem became a predominantly black metropolis. The Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
A black congregation worshipping nearby took ownership of the building.
A black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martins, who led a boycott against the retailers on Eighth and Twenty Fifth Streets, a major street for shopping in Harlem, for refusing to hire and promote black workers.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the residents of Father Johnson's parish planned to restore it, they arranged for the carillon to be built.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martins, proudly called the carillon the "Poor Man's Bell".
The expert who played the carillon last July called it something different: "a historical treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert, Tiffany Niang of the University of Michigan, added that it was the world's orthem carillon played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had been hired 18 years earlier to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex case of architects and contractors, who are appointed by lay leaders of the church or by the Episcopal dioceses.
The vestry's governing body, which is made up of lay leaders, expressed their concern last July that they thought they would transfer the costs to the diocesan vestry, although the vestry was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese's work.
In California, 13-year-old Gulda was injured by a shark attack after diving for shrimp.
A 13-year-old boy was injured after being attacked by a shark after diving for shrimp on the first day of the shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. on Beacons Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he and friends heard the boy crying for help while they were diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning, and then paddled out with a group of men to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming for a snail, but then he realized that the boy was screaming because he had bitten him!
I was bitten!
Her throat was slit", Hamel said, as he reached the boy and looked at him.
"I scream for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as an endangered species.
Giles also said the victim suffered a severe injury to the upper part of his torso.
Officials have banned access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Soami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons.
Giles said that more than 135 species of sharks are found in the area, most of which are not endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK market
SensoryBrizz is set to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams as department stores with eye-catching cosmetics and expert support staff.
The giant beauty isles will be launched in 11 stores nationwide and others if they prove successful as part of a strong push to enter the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market. The UK beauty market is growing whereas the fashion and home decor essentials market has fallen.
The investment in luxury comes as supermarkets are finding new ways to fill shelves once filled with TVs, microwaves and home decor items.
SensoryBrizz says it will double its range of products to 3,000, including for the first time Revlon, Easy, Twiserman and Dr. Pop.
Existing cosmetics ranges like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Bert's Bees will have more space, with separate spaces for shops like Boots.
The supermarket is introducing its boutique makeup range with most products being vegan friendly which has become very popular among young shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be running a trial of product delivery in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and small food purchases at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets are trying to increase their customer base.
Mike Koop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that outlets will have to look like department stores as the supermarket chain competes with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl and will have more services and products such as groceries.
Since Sainsbury's bought the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, hundreds of Argos outlets have been established in the stores and a few Habitat outlets have also been opened, which has increased grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable, the company claims.
Previous attempts to decorate the supermarket and the pharmacy section have failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Fike Boots in the early 2000s but the venture was shut down due to a dispute over how to share profits from the chemist's store in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is taking this new approach after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Selessio, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy.
The company said Lloyd's would contribute to the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Posée and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of SensoryBars, said: "We have changed the way we work with our aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location, we are now a reliable shopping destination that will challenge the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones is on fire after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11m deal.
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a deal with lifestyle brand Peter Jones to focus on her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home furnishings and accessories brand Trully.
The pair's business is compared to Gup's brand of Gineth Paltrow.
The morning host, 37, announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their exciting lifestyle brand business at the last minute with the intention of focusing on Marks & Spencer and his new bumper deal with ITV.
Sources say Jones became "fire-shy" in the reggae scene when, in a meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, the TV golden girl admitted she had no time for their home furnishings and accessory brand trolls because of her new deal worth up to £1.5 million.
The business was compared to the Gup brand of Gineth Paltrow and was expected to double Willowby's £11 million fortune.
After announcing his departure from Truly on Instagram, Willoughby, 37, left Britain by jet plane for his holiday home.
A source said: "So far, Truli has been at the top of the list of priorities for Haly.
It was part of his long-term future plan that would meet his economic needs for the next few decades.
His decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, the project was supposed to start soon.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready to be sold".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is currently one of Britain's most trusted stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds as it has already invested heavily in products ranging from pillows to candles, clothing and homewares, and the possible delay of its launch will add to the loss.
And that could be the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for a decade.
Willoughby started Truly with CAP in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it", she says.
He joked that he had expressed a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and made a comment that some people would consider "unpresidential".
Why has President Trump made such concessions?
Trump said in his "news anchor" voice.
"I did not give up".
He said that Kim is eager to meet for a second time after their initial meeting in Singapore in June.Trump called their first meeting a huge step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's earlier disarmament moves.
However, he said the US was imposing sanctions to put pressure on them.
Trump expressed a more positive outlook during his rally speech.
"We are in a good position with North Korea", he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
It could have killed over ten million people.
We have a great relationship now.
He claims that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results that have led to the completion of rocket tests, the release of prisoners, and the repatriation of remaining American personnel.
And she has endorsed his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people in the crowded arena, there are only 200 people in the arena", Trump pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
An island in Indonesia is devastated by a tsunami and earthquake, hundreds are killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international cooperation, so it is challenging", Ms. Sambang said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palau, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether foreign agencies will be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia is woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature, even in the face of its regular earthquake events.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, other coastal areas have seen a decline in shelters.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, despite the ongoing state of alert, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even when the weather is fine, many of Indonesia's islands are challenging to navigate.
Natural disasters make communication more difficult.
A hospital ship deployed to Lombok is heading to Palau to treat the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a focus of his election campaign and has invested heavily in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment has kept Mr. Zoko's government on a tight leash before re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also feeling the strain of Indonesia's long-standing communal tensions, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand were left homeless in the riots between Christians and Muslims, which saw the two groups fighting in the streets with clubs, bows, and other heavy weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores a beautifully equalised goal in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge were 30 metres from the Chelsea goalpost when they caught a pass from Zardhan Shakir, who was 1-0 down.
He first moves the ball to the left and then shoots at the far post.
The shot is towards the top of the box and towards the right corner of the net.
The ball finally enters the net, passing the jumping Kepa Arizaba.
"It's important to get in the right position to catch the ball in time, because players like Shaq always push as far as possible before the ball, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
"I'm gonna give a little tap when I see Kante coming and not a shot without thinking".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute of the match.
The Blues striker passed Kovacic in the mat, then ran from midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic was leading the ball in midfield.
He then gave Hazard a nice pass in the box in Liverpool's defense cheer.
Hazard beat the defense in the running and scored with a left foot shot into the net of the far post.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Vidoton in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3pm, with the match scheduled to start at the end of the day.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused a 20-foot-high water slide, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of 380,000, is covered in the rubble of the collapsed buildings.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament is the latest victim of the history rewriting controversy
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice after the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious symbols at the hands of its fanatical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's suggestion "foolish" and an attempt to "rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become the target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was not carried out by or at the behest of Cromwell.
The false Cromwell statue would be scrapped in the previous century by the actions of his predecessor Thomas.
The extraordinary statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is a 19th-century idea and part of a historical character that many people consider to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people think of Cromwell as the defender of Parliament against external pressures, in his case, against the pressures of monarchy which few people now believe but many did in the 19th century.
But whether it is a completely accurate depiction of the time is part of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a familiar character who represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance".
The killer pig slaughtered the Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China and killed him.
The man, identified only by his family name Yuan, was found with a ruptured artery and battered with blood near a pig stall at the Liupanshui market in southern China's Guizhou province, according to a report in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
The report said he came to the market with his brother Fupato from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, her half-brother found her dead and found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the barn with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised", said Fupato's brother who was identified as his family name U, quoting the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 am on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man is not his or his half-brother's.
A market manager told the Evening News that police were gathering alms at the scene and the pig was being held in isolation so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound piggy forced a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife came and scared the pig away.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon ate his pig, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but can act as "triggers" that taste like blood.
"They are only playing around.
They bite small, very eager creatures... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to understand them well enough", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosara will cause heavy rainfall that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's going north on Sunday.
On this side, a system in the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and is moving eastward toward the West Coast of the United States. Rosa Baja will hit the California Peninsula as a seasonal storm on Monday and it will push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
The Rosario will cause up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The deep tropical moisture then combined with the currents rushing towards it will cause heavy rainfall across the southern hemisphere in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity can produce rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in various parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The sporadic pace of the tropical rains is likely to cause flash flooding and a very rapid deterioration of the situation.
It would be foolish to go out on foot in the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into dangerous rivers, and thunderstorms can cause strong winds and dust.
The storm system will cause locally heavy rainfall in parts of the coastal region of Southern California.
The rainfall can be up to half an inch which can cause minor debris flows on the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers are expected in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, followed by a heavy downpour that will spread across the state from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rains will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
Several extreme temperature changes are expected in parts of the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature change was seen in the central United States on Sunday.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa have seen about 20 degrees of temperature difference.
The remaining heat of summer will try to rise and spread again in the next few days.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to warm in early October, with temperatures in the mid-80s from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could see temperatures reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that the eastern United States is likely to experience higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanagh's audition has been watched by over 20 million people.
The shocking testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault of Christine Blazy Ford, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, was watched by more than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political wrangling continues, with broadcasters suspending regular programming due to Friday's last-minute shock: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that would give the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanagh had touched him and tried to unwrap him at a drunken high school party.
Kavanagh said in a passionate testimony that he is 100% sure that the incident did not happen.
It is likely that 20.4 million more people than the Nielsen report stated watched the event on Friday.
The company averaged the viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks that aired the program did not immediately have viewership figures available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble with the number of people he sees sitting in his office.
The event had the same audience as the football playoffs or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, attracted the highest average viewership of any network that broadcasted the day-long hearings, at 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
Flake was the central character in today's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he boarded an elevator to reach the Judiciary Committee hearing and was shouted at by protesters.
He stood for a few minutes with his head bowed in the face of the harassment of the protesters, which was broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power, while many women are helpless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said he had more to say at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast it live.
But Flake said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate next week the allegations against the nominee, which had been requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake's agreement was partially influenced by his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon.
After talking to the Queen, Flake talked to a few other senators and reached his conclusion.
Flake's decision was stunning, as it was clear that the Republicans had no vote to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing "political games" with Britain's future and ignoring the interests of the nation.
On 29 September 2018, UK Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, where she was the first woman to hold the position.
In another interview published alongside his front-page interview, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued to criticise May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the UK and EU's proposal to collect revenue from each other was "totally unreasonable".
Police arrested Dayton Simpson as a suspect in the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to The Advocate, his bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released an initial report Friday citing gunshot wounds to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Catch Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and area residents for assisting in the investigation that resulted in the suspect's arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked the area's law enforcement agency for its "relentless efforts and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'6" forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "saddened" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's a concern for all time", Wade said.
The volcanic eruption in Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after the eruption increased in activity and the amount of gas and ash reached 183 on the scale in 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring multiple thunderstorms and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed thin layers of ash falling on car windshields in areas such as Mexico City's Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been noticing an increase in activity since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked Mexico in September 2017, just 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital.
Known as Don Goyo, the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after riot police clashed with pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to mark the first anniversary of the vote for Catalan independence, which has caused public discord.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the police who were blocking them, creating a black cloud on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there was a fight which was stopped by the police using sticks.
For hours, the demonstrators chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" and faced the pro-unity protesters who chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries caused by the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been running high in the region since Madrid declared illegal the October 1 referendum, celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although the turnout was low as the majority of the public opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in violent clashes with police last year as voters were prevented from voting in the region-wide vote.
The independents were in the streets all night on Friday to prevent the demonstration in favor of the national police.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to take different streets.
68-year-old Nurse Termis, an electricity worker who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents tear up for voting, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a significant but narrow victory in the provincial election last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum as many of their best-known leaders await trial in voluntary exile or detention for their organizational role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Juan Puig, who is recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that politicians on both sides had caused the conflict.
He added, "The unrest is intensifying day by day".
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who remained in pre-trial detention on Saturday, announced late last year that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to resist the repression of democratic values by the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate in the European elections", he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car collides with house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car at a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Balinagarda Crescent at 19:30 hours Bangladesh time on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blimings says the gates and the building have been damaged.
At some point, the car may be targeted and crossbow and shot.
Menger's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers in the final.
Dolly Menger's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
Steven Gerrard was handed a second defeat in 18 games as Ibbrox club manager, stunning the promoted Livingston Rangers.
Dolly Menger's goal created the gap as Gary Holt's side equalised with the second goal from the Hibernians.
Gerrard's side are without a single win in the Premiership this season and face top-seeded Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, who have already extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, have yet to see the head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, taste defeat.
Livingston missed several chances against their feckless opponent.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, as their aggressive attitude caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson advanced by breaking the defence but failing to make his own efforts pay off, while Alan Lithgow could only drive his effort wide after sliding past Craig Halkett to meet with the headers.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that the guests would be a nuisance on the set.
And that's where the trick comes in.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston opened the scoring. Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to set up Menga, who scored from the centre of the box with a touchdown.
At this stage, the Rangers were dominating the ball but they were perceiving the hosts' defence as vulnerable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time in the penalty box.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos missed a shot of Kelly.
Scott Pittman lost to Rangers goalkeeper Alan MacGregor on foot and won another set piece for Livingston from the Lithgow winger.
Crosses were continually coming into the Livingston box and also continually being cleared, although two penalty requests - for the alternate Glenn Middleton after Hallett's challenge and for the handball - were dismissed.
The incredible achievement of Livingston - analysis
The BBC Scotland at the Lamont Tony McCarney Arena in Alsace,
A remarkable performance and result for Livingston.
For one person, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations in their upward mobility.
Their style of play and players have changed little since their return to the top level, but the credit goes to Holt for the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, created a superbly organized defense, and kept Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Warl on their toes at all times.
The Rangers were less inspired, though.
They're not as good as they were under Gerard.
They lacked the final ball - only once did they open the hosts - and this is a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The situation was very positive on Saturday, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for Brexit.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police set up security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of whom were also Kurds - have raised their voices in condemnation of both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him to the country.
This conflict demonstrates that a visitor is praised by German Turks as a hero and condemned by others as a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10am Bangladesh time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the vehicle and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened months after another bicycle accident on Childers Street, which is 1 mile from Saturday's crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers are working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The road has been closed and a bus barrier has been installed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the chaos.
Six prison officers were injured in the chaos at the high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Larter in Orchestrelshire around 9.30am on Sunday and is ongoing.
The riot police brought in "Tornado" officers, including eight prisoners who were part of a squad.
Officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "HMP Long Larryn has deployed specially trained prison staff to deal with an ongoing incident.
Six members of staff treated for injuries
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be brought to justice and they will spend a long time behind bars".
HMP Long Larn has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator went to the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, Wright officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which staff were attacked with pool force.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (although drought-prone areas may benefit).
Tropical depression-hit Arizona is rare, but that's exactly what looks to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa whips its remaining strength across the southwestern desert with the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The fast is expected to arrive directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and with rainfall late Monday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A-Z border".
The latest National Hurricane Center model forecasts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with the Mogollon Rim in Arizona having isolated amounts of up to 6 inches.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive a total of 1 to 2 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the daily rainfall can be a blessing as areas are dry
Although flooding is a serious concern, the rainfall is likely to be of some benefit as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the US drought watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Roza, still a strong hurricane, was at a peak of 85 miles per hour Sunday morning, moving south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, at 385 miles per hour and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is gaining strength as it faces colder waters in the Pacific Ocean.
So, a tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico by Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is possible across parts of Mexico, creating a significant flood risk.
"Up to 10 inches of rain expected in northwestern Sonora from Baja California"
Rosa will then travel northward across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The major hazard expected from the remnants of the storm is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains can cause deadly flash floods and destructive currents in the desert and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested in Somerset for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4pm on Saturday, Bangladesh time.
He was taken to the hospital where he is now in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers are asking anyone who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kavanah is a victim of the "cruelty, anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and offensive tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was subjected to "cruelty, anger" by the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually abused by him decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his complaint.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the excellence and the virtues and the courage of Kavanaugh that day".
Addressing West Virginia supporters, he said a vote for Judge Kavanaugh would be a vote to protect "the most successful legal personality of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service".
The president vaguely acknowledged Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
"We are just five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not participating, but I'm really participating", he said.
"That's why I'm always looking to fight for the best candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and deter".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is not expected to take place until Friday, a senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is expected to rise by hundreds.
At least 384 people were killed and many more swept into the streams as a huge wave washed ashore after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) wave hit the coast in the evening, rushing many to their deaths and destroying everything in its path".
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"People were still on the beach yesterday when the tsunami threat appeared and those who could not immediately run away became the victims", Indonesian disaster management agency BNPB spokesman Sutoyo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything above the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles) in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived,
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aerial footage released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were overturned and collapsed, and a mosque was submerged in water.
The aftershocks continue to roam the coastal town on Saturdays.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the World War II Hiroshima atomic bomb.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugraho described the damage as "extensive" with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
Some of the bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building.He said that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugraho said that the casualties and damage could be higher in the area of Dangala, near the epicenter of the earthquake, along the coastline 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu.
The communication system "was completely paralyzed with no information", Nugraho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, "the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were being sent to the affected areas".
"It's already a tragedy but it could be worse.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Pulu, although officials said the waves arrived when warnings were issued.
Footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building yelling a tsunami warning to people in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall-like stream of water slammed into the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to rescue.
The military has begun sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities in support of the rescue effort, officials said, adding that food and other basic necessities are now urgently needed by the rescuers.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will be closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu shelters on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's too bad.
According to Mr. Dossebber, while the UN staff were safely traveling from Dongola to the city of Palu, where the staff were sheltering in their office yard, they saw images of destruction on the way.
Doseba added that they saw many homes destroyed.
It's a shame.
Even as aid groups began their disaster relief operations, some complained that foreign aid workers were being too skillfully blocked from traveling to the camps.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, food supplies and personnel can only come when a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Aulya Ariyani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said, "It is still a provincial disaster".
Once the government says yes, it is a national disaster, we can start international aid but we have not received any such announcement yet.
On the second night of the Friday tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing are hoping for a miracle that will bring the hope of finding them at the end of a cruel chapter of natural disaster.
A small boy was pulled from the mud on Saturday.
Rescue workers on Sunday rescued a woman who had been trapped under a rock for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Jendon Subandono trained two paragliders missing from the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that the people trapped in the Roya Roya Hotel were his students.
He said, "As a pioneer of paragliding, I am responsible for my own passion".
Mr. Zendon recalled how the news of the Roya Roya Hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community hours later, when he was frustrated and sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu competitors who were attending a beach festival.
Although his message was not read, it was unread.
He said, "That means the message was not sent".
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling money in an ATM machine in Newport, La.
A press release from the Newport Police Department said that on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 when Brink's employees were depositing money at an ATM.
The driver was emptying money from the ATM at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more, Detective Dennis McCarthy told a news conference.
While he was working, another "Brinks ran after the worker" and ran off with a bag of money that was ready to be handed over.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects running away, but the police have not yet specified the number of people involved.
Anyone who can identify these individuals are asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: This rapper changed his name to Yea.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Saturday, he tweeted: "Officially known as Kane West".
West, 41, was also known as Yee for some time and used the name as a nickname.
The name change came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to unveil his new album Yandy.
The producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande, who had cancelled the show for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him, as well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name.
West told Big Boy earlier this year, while discussing the album's title with the radio host, "I believe that 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you.'"
So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It's from Cain, which means the one person, the one who reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more about who we are".
He is one of the few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he announced that he prefers the name Love and Brothers Love.
One of West's former colleagues, J-Z, has also worked with hyphenated, hyphen-free and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO has also vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez has vowed on the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students that he will not use military force against civilians.
Lopez promised at Tallatelico Plaza in Abreu, on Saturday, that "he will not use military force to oppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest that killed 300 people as the left-wing student movement in Latin America was making its mark.
Lopez Obradouro apologized to young Mexicans for the monthly tuition and for helping to build more public universities.
He says unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to crime syndicates.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in AI, the US should also double its research spending, said AI researcher and investor Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The quote comes from a government source, who has declared in the United States that the United States has an official strategic deficit in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its new plan last year: its goal to become the number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
Lee also said that "doubling the budget for AI research would be a good new start where most countries are far behind and we are looking for the next step in advancing AI".
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the United States gaining the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, is the CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a Sinovation Venture, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American player, and in the fall, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge to determine the next steps.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
"China is not removing academic leaders; the corporates are providing them", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Changes to immigration policy could help further US AI efforts, Lee said.
"I think the green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
China's State Council released its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, as do the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that fund US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which means involving partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As of the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation attempting to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-old conflict with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has vetoed entry into NATO and the European Union, representing a claim to its northern neighbor by name.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents feel that the change will erode the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent for the referendum to be valid in a boycott campaign.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for the recognition of the Treaty with Greece and for membership in NATO and the European Union?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay a price for admission to the European Union and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to live freely in the shadow of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said Oliviera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the results of the vote by decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said that there were no reports of irregularities as of 1pm.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe", said Josie Tenijewski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko, voted in favor of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name, which would pave the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavaderkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join not through the door of service, but with our heads held high", Kavaderkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Eurasian unity".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "certainty of the future".
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday said that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum below the turnout required for a turn-out.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs more than 50 percent of the vote to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the Brighton defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling ejected from Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made his score extra easy to see in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before heading into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he threw a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to give a shot to the right side of the net, defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his legs", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment".
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial edge of the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He passed the ball to Leroy Sen with a nice pass to the left-hand corner.
Sean took a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before it crossed the line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in the Spoilers vs. the Rockies game.
There was little reason to force another start after the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention.
But the ever-competitive Sharzer hopes to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the playoff impact is in the Rockies' one-game lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to earn their first division title.
"Even if we're not playing for nothing, at least we can put our foot in the rubber with the atmosphere in Denver and knowing that the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but there are rumours that Scherzer could pitch in under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, skipped a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch in his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president pointed sharply to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we have done is at risk in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetimes.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running away, but I'm really running away, so I'm all over the place fighting for the great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the baseness, the cruelty.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they have to grind down to get power and control, they just want power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
He said Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and contain".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untrustworthy".
He called out Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which drew loud cheers from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, what.
No, oh no, I'll wait -- that was really bad body language. Worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a free-thinking organization.
People who say what they think in their mouths are not tolerated here.
When the momentum of my local party voted me guilty, it was no surprise.
Because your speaking your mind is not welcome here - I was the last Labour MP on the list to let you know.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security and similar issues, on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders either.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting said "we want to make the meetings inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is the first time that a Friday night GC meeting has been anything but.
But sadly, today, this is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "kind, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It has increasingly become clear that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues who I thought shared my political views expecting me to take a U-turn and take a position I would never have agreed to - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, there are calls on social media to remove me, to denounce the policies of the Centre, and to tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face the storms of discrimination or racial abuse on a daily basis but never shy away from it.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is how the immoderation of the bully has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free-thinking organization and every "no-confidence" vote or change in the election rules narrows the group.
For the last two years, I've been told by many people to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and that I'll be "okay".
But I didn't come into politics to do that.
When I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, we were discouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally destroyed our vast school classrooms, and I tried to provide essential government services to those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was at all confused about my policy stance and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the movement on Friday, I can only say that I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in showing loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services.
But this is not a message for me to the Nottingham Momentum, this is for my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of stalemate or political activism will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Rising to the top of the undefeated Ayr
Two late attempts may have narrowed the gap a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayer deserved to win in this extraordinarily entertaining Tennent premiership match of the day.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take chances, that helped the hosts win and was a valid reason for coach Peter Murchi to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy".
Melrose's Robin Christie says: "Credit to the AIR, they've used their potential better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however, a yellow card to Scotland player Rory Hughes, which sent him out for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the majority and Jason Baggott an unsuccessful try.
Climo extended the lead of the A's by scoring a penalty, just before, during halftime, he scored a single try to make it 17-5 at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was then suspended for a long time due to a serious injury to Rueridh Nott, who was stretched and after the match resumed, Ayer went further with a Stefford McDowall try, which converted Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and once again a spell of deadly pressure resulted in the extra player of Ayr being penalised by Melrose's Bruce Colvin attempt.
Although the hosts came right back, and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to deal with Klimo without the ball, Macpherson was out of the penalty line and put the goalkeeper ahead with a touchdown.
Once again Climo converted, with Kyle Rowe taking the lead while David Armstrong's box kicked and flanker Gregor Henry sent out on the home side's fifth try.
Steel Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Steel Game star Ford Keiran has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his own life after Craigslist.
According to the official records listing, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun sources have indicated that Kiernan is looking to get involved in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will open the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rigging clad naval headquarters at La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the shipyards are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right"
It is a duty to recover".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict for property is still vivid, as is the desire to sail once more into the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's verdict on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"We have the momentum, unity and calmness that Bolivia has and of course we are expecting results with a positive outlook", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's claim that - after decades of proper negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to Bolivia at sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year - also has a lot riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor - and if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to grant Chile territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of the potential negotiations.
The ICJ ruling, which comes after only six months of hearing final arguments, indicates that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Garrett, a Chilean expert in international law.
And Bolivia's cause may have been pushed backwards in the last four years rather than forward.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Jarrete said.
Morales' anti-war speech has raised any redundancy in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk for a while, but after that it will be very difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian delegate to The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velázquez, denied that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political pillar.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past".
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come unless the US is trusted.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons first unless Washington is trusted.
He was addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the US to honour the promises made by the rival leaders during a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the way to re-launching stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after more than three months in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War would tip off North Korea.
Washington is wary that Pyongyang may agree to the declaration without first going through a process of substantial disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country sees as possibly the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo also wants to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest in giant headwear on a high street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun entirely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a line of oversized head gear for their SS19 collection at the runway that shocked the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the most absurd hats were teased on Instagram, and these designers sent their eye-catching creation to Katwa.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with a feather-like broad stem that covered the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories include ornamental watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also released a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks resembled Hannibal Lecter with lipstick sewn and a horrifyingly funny comparison.
One creation resembles full scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big fashion statement - you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that the giant bonnets may be heading to the high street near you.
Outsized hats are competing with La Bomba, the two-foot-wide straw hat that has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emilie Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly unconventional hat that has been circulating across social media has inspired Catwalk to create another big one - a straw beach bag that is almost as big as a swimsuit model.
The burnt orange Rafaea bag, trimmed with Rafaea fringing and with a white leather handle on top, was one of the pieces in the SS19 collection of La Rivière by Jacques Mas at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told the FIMEL: 'I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive on the high street next summer - it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories as designers have such a big impact.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and this continued with another outstanding test result in 2018, which was only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that a particular school can design and implement curriculum, we see modern languages continuing to be a popular and preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examination, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates among individual schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages achieved the higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grades A in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved A.
It proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a vital skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as a subject of choice, being held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of individual schools and elsewhere.
A UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 survey found that 17% of employers blamed their lack of language skills as the reason they struggle to fill vacancies.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
The skills that language requires for more potential job opportunities are needed in a globalized world.
For anyone who has chosen a career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future as they acquire skills for a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 per cent were not fluent in a foreign language during a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a tenth of a percent, 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others, looking towards 2020, will teach languages considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have many languages to choose from, with teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment it cannot be denied at this moment that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity and excitement for young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James' first trip to the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be one more and 48 less", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's YouTube channel during the West Virginia rally
President Donald Trump stormed the campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies for Trump next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation votes pending in his favor to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm election, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how are you watching online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live stream on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to speak this week about the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing, which has been heated by allegations of sexual misconduct during an FBI investigation with an expected Senate confirmation vote.
But the initial goal of opening these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign says the purpose of the five rallies next week is to "strengthen volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters reported.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbenko Arena in Wheeling, today's rally "may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump visited West Virginia this Saturday for the second time since last month, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
With Trump ahead of the election, West Virginia is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morisi that the president should try to give him more leverage in the election", said Simon Hather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA hungry to fight to keep the hope alive in the singles on Sunday
The Ryder Cup was needed on Saturday afternoon after three one-sided sessions.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players really believe in, and most of the competition is like that.
So where's the Momentum they say?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum now", Jordan Spieth said of going for a walk that day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead with twelve games to go.
As Speeth said, the Americans feel they have some help on the way and they can take encouragement from a lot of things, especially the form of Speeth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and they both have scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from start to finish and leading from the front.
The celebratory cries grew louder as her round progressed, as she and Thomas, two points behind despite scoring, made the crucial four-point full-square pass to win the match.
His buttocks that won the game for them on the 15th received the same kind of screaming, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You have to really go deep and think about your match", Spieth said.
Each of these players now has it.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to score more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's unfair story.
Europe's odd but adorable pair of four by four and can't make a mistake.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at nine o'clock.
That run, and the way their energy was flowing in and out of this enthusiastic crowd, seemed to be the Sunday loser, and as the sun set on Le Golf National, there was no more popular player in the running to seal a European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Better if both are in different holes at the same time.
Although the glory of Europe is still to be seen.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did some damage to the morning's foreball hero Sergio Garcia when they were paired with Alex Noreen.
The first nine had a bogey and two double Spaniards and threw the Swede into a hole from which they never got back up.
Sunday, though, there's no one to pull you out of your hole.
The interaction between the pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the strategy that can change instantly are all very interesting to watch from close up for the Forbells and the Forsams.
Europe have played relatively well as a team so far and took a significant lead on the final day but this forsom session has further proved that Team USA have an appetite for fighting that some, especially on the Stateside, had suspected.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a healthy advantage of Saturday's football and foreplay match against the United States on the final day of the Ryder Cup, with a 10-6 lead.
The spirited pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have now taken their tally to four points in the Golf National with two wins against the two-time defending champions, Tiger Woods.
Thomas Jorn's European side, bidding to reclaim the trophy lost two years ago at Hazeltine, won the series 3-1 after blowing out the flawed American side in the morning fours.
The US won two matches and offered more resistance in the fourth, but they could not fill the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to reclaim the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, after an extraordinary weekend together, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four games.
They then defeated Woods and Patrick Reed at the fours, then defeated a losing Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambiu more forcefully by 5 and 4 in a superbly javelin.
Woods, who had pulled himself together in two matches on Saturday, has occasionally been a flash of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in both his foreball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning foorball, returns to foursam partner Henrik Stenson for a 2 and 1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepcker - world number one and number three.
Southwest of Paris on a pleasant, windy day though Europe was not on its own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a strong 2 and 1 victory against Spain's Jon Ram and Ian Poulter in the foreball and lost the opening two holes in the foreham to Poulter and Rory McIlroy, who came back to defeat them 4 and 3.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in a single set, although as of now Furik's side only need a draw to reclaim the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, the Sunday counter-attack looks like it will overtake them.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without 'any' confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that existing sanctions are deepening mistrust of the United States and that there is no chance for the country to unilaterally give up their nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the World Organization that North Korea took "significant goodwill steps" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear laboratory, and pledging not to increase the proliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction in the United States", he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, then we have no trust in our national security and there is no way to unilaterally disarm from our side in such a situation".
While Ri described North Korea's complaints against Washington's "rocky" approach to nuclear disarmament as being rewarded for North Korea's slow pace, his remarks were significant because he did not rule out unilateral nuclear disarmament altogether, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim "pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea".
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"America has insisted on 'disarmament-first' and has increased the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its objectives with coercion, even as it objects to the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us down is a pipe dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust".
Ri did not comment on the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader outlined to the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months: "If the issue of disarmament had been South Korea, not the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a state of flux".
Still, Ri's speech had a dramatically different tone from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US mainland was inevitably targeted by North Korean rockets while "Mr. Evil President" Trump suicidally called Kim "Rocket Man".
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was disarmed.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time limit for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for its actions by the UN Security Council
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must remain in effect until we realize a fully verified disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riyadh at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He said when he left Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only until a few hours before North Korea had denounced him for "claiming like a thug"!
North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the US "takes similar measures".
He said that the "concerted measures" Kim told him he was looking for were the security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore and the security guarantees he had given moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is giving all of its graduates ways to get more sleep to counter the growing culture of caffeine-fueled "nightclubs".
An academic has discovered that students at the world's number one university are often confused about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sigler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
And then a girl came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me this in my senior year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, 'he told the Telegraph.
Launched for the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleep habits are essential to improve academic and athletic performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Department of Health Care, said the university decided to launch the course after students were severely sleep-deprived this week.
The hour-long course consists of a series of related tasks.
One section features a dorm room illustration, where students will click on coffee cups, screens, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and to appreciate the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encouraging participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know the health effects of your decision to smoke,' adds Professor Sizzler.
He said that the culture of pride in staying up all night is still present, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even sleep deprivation can starve the brain, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sawe, 19, a chemical and physical biology student in California who helped Professor Sizilar design the course, also took a class during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him for a campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes to encourage all postgraduate students to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Sizilar recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they should go to bed and when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electric screens and LED lights, which can destroy your circadian rhythm, causing trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The Shiites of the Golan Gerrard of the Manga.
Rangers suffered another away defeat as Steven Gerrard's side lost 1-0 to Livingston at the Dolly Manger.
The Iberiks were looking for another win after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard his second defeat as manager in 18 games, which took him eight points clear of Hearts, who were leading the premiership at Ladbroke.
Mangala was injured seven minutes into the half-time, but the unlikely Rangers line-up never gave them a fight.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston up to third and outrunning Hibernian on goal difference.
And it could be more trouble for the Rangers as Linesman Calum Spence has been treated for head injuries after being thrown off the highway.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that took Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi 11 that took a point away from Hearts last week and should be proud of the way his well-equipped team held the opponent to a chokehold.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston has done more with their ball.
Menger sent Scott Pittman off for Alan McGregor's first leg-off goal, which should have scored in just two minutes, but the midfielder squandered his big chance.
Keegan got a long free-kick from Jacobs to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit the ball from the back post.
The Rangers regained control but their confidence in the final third was more than expected.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that his penalty should have been taken at the quarter-final because of the clash between him and Steven Lawless, but the referee, Steven Thompson, rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers could only target two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only slightly hampered by Lasana Koulibaly's head and Ov Ezharia's shot.
Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they are the only ones who deserve their game.
Once again the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' deep set-piece.
Scott Earfield did not react to Decan Gallagher's ball-slit by Scott Robinson, keeping his head cool to pick the manga for the general finish.
Gerrard took action at the break by replacing Kulibly with Ryan Kent and this change was going to work almost immediately as the winger was on the morals, but the extraordinary Kelly moved him off the line to the block.
However, Livingston started to play exactly the kind of game that the crowd enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halcutt sending long balls after long balls.
Holt's team could have taken their lead in the final stage, but McGregor was reluctant to ruin Jacobs' efforts before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Thompson again backtracked on Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton's claim of a late penalty as he stumbled with Jacobs.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger counter became a mainstay of pop culture as well, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly promising cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "That's a lot of noise, what do you say?"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But his legendary invention still lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine, as part of the treatment, teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then be re-introduced.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients with various cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory so they can "see" the protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-introducing the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Bargefsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "provides growth for a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers", explains Prof. Barzowski.
A similar approach has worked in treating leukemia by extracting immune cells from outside the patient and "teaching" them how to "target" cancer cells.
Kanye West is in a pro-Trump debate on SNL wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed off the studio after a rousing performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would stay in the spotlight in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Hat, she railed against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white person, they say: "How can you like Trump, he's racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have gotten out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about claims of sexual abuse by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's parody was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear whether the post was meant to mock West.
West also complained to the audience that he had to face problems in the backstage with his headgear.
"They beat me in the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out with the hat.'
They abused me!
And then they said I was in a sunken place", according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Would you like to see the place?" saying that he would read his "Superman cap", because it means you can't tell me what to do. Would you like to see the world move forward?
Then try to love".
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast members were embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication that: "There was a pinfall of silence throughout the studio".
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
Perrier confused many by wearing bottle-like outfits in his performance of the song West I Love It.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the evildoers. "
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was who he was and he was absolutely great".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art') who is embracing and spreading ideals that are harmful to my community.
He is free.
And so are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and has followed in the footsteps of D.D., who is known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.D.D.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to an icon who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamore, according to the police.
Asami is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his martial arts role as Jon Snow in HBO's offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor says that the stereotype of macho heroes on screen is to give young boys the impression that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes 'something went wrong' and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits he feels strongly about the issue.
'I personally feel, quite strongly, at this moment - where are we going wrong in masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach men growing up that we are now facing this problem?'
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its hyper-masculine characters.
He added: 'What is the subjunctive and what are we learning?
What is it that they teach on TV and in the streets that boys think that this is the way they have to follow to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time - how do we change it?
Because clearly the young people have done something wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing a Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series is renewed next summer, saying that he has "finished the battlefield and the life of the horse".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which is about a film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show, so it's my future family that gave me my life
Rose played the love interest of Egret, Kit's character in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 cases in the country, health officials said.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases were due to sexually transmitted infections, which are a changed phenomenon from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China to the bloodstream.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still considered to be rampant.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, marry women later.
Many infections are caused by inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV drugs available to the public as part of its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaks of GOP senators, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that these claims were being promoted by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked data reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information, which appeared online on Thursday, was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Scholar and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with Waters' office and disclosed information about which members of Waters' staff had been involved, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, privacy and security have been compromised by this fraud and false accusation - was in no way responsible for this data leak.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online by many, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This rejection is angry", wrote Fleisher.
"It shows that he has no inclination to be a Congressman.
They don't get angry when someone is accused of something they didn't do.
They must not be skeptical.
They should not question the motives of the complainant.
They must be calm and serene".
Fleisher, who was comparing Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, was found by critics to be very angry during a hearing Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's big if it's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office has alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the criminals are exposed", he continued, "and they are held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review by the weak Rowan Atkinson spy
It is now traditional to see Brexit implications in any new film, including British thrillers, and this seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-mocking fact of how much of a waste nation we are become a new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced disabled Johnny English has a license to do new things for the second time - his name more than anything else suggests that he is a broad comic creation designed for the non-English-language film world.
He is of course the silly secret agent who, despite the odd tendency to be a little bit stuck in smooth jocks, contributed a dash of Mr Bean and a chunk of chop to the Sharriots of Fire theme tune in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was based primarily on the Traveller and the man of international mystery Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, spreading chaos in the consciousness.
There are one or two great moments in this latest Jay Out.
I loved to see Johnny English coming to a helicopter in medieval armor, hanging from the rotor blades with a little helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is showing, but the humor has been felt to be quite understated and oddly overblown, especially with "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offering comedy as an ingredient with confidence.
The humor seems more directed towards children than adults, and to me the bizarre accidents of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused on the character of Bean as Atkinson's silent-film jokes.
The perennially topical foundation is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the top secret web of Britain's spy agency, exposing all of Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort of a prime minister who is already suffering from a complete political crisis, is ambiguous and a closed-minded personality: Emma Thompson does her best with this semi-Teresa-may character but there is not much to work in the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy was compromised, so he had to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means talking to Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some Posh establishment, but teaches off the record how to be an undercover operative: here's some good humor, since English offers the school a rock-type academy of intelligence.
English returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is once again reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bowie, played by Ben Miller.
Baugh is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a role of a jelly-hockey-stick in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin, who were fatally mistaken in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action to face off against Olga Kurylenko's seductress, Ofelia Bulutova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the spell of a charismatic billionaire employee who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinner Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Baugh begin their far-reaching high-zinc whimsy: under the guise of waiters they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they start a brawl by sneaking themselves into Voltaire's luxury boat; and English Voltaire tries to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the inside of the house, creating pure chaos.
All the stops are obviously pulled for the final sequence, but as much as it's mind-blowing and hilarious, there's a little bit of kid TV in the whole thing.
It's a very average staff.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it is planning to work four days a week for Britain but will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a master plan that will see the British work four days a week - but get paid for five days.
The group reportedly wants company owners to share the money saved by giving employees an extra day off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see employees enjoy three days of vacation - but still take home the same salary.
Sources say the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic program and that workers are planning to move the country.
The Trades Union Congress has approved the move to a four-day week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day workday is a desire that fits in with the party approach to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.'
The Labour Party, not the first to support such an idea, made a four-day working day promise during their 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working day is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used last week's labor conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he is determined to return power to utility companies from 'unrecognized directors' and 'beneficiaries'.
The Shadow Chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back because the Labour government may give some 'exemption' due to perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to keep employees on company boards and create an inclusive ownership fund to equalise 10 per cent of employees in private sector companies, whose annual dividend stands at $500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh investigation by the FBI can change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could turn any Republican senators in their favor.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, of course", said Kennedy.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this, I called him, the complaint came up, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, however, seems to be unchanged.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanagh and a pretty big complaint is going to be needed for that to change", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"and whoever he said he was, they couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a great line-up of star performers and an equally impressive mission; end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people walk the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, not just to see it happen, but to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of activists internationally promoting the hope of eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do multiple tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen in achieving its goal with 12 years left?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the real step to persuade people to take action, or is it another case of so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving toward various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce more than $37 billion in equity commitments and policies that will impact the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that have emerged from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or funded.
The team estimates that the secured funds have directly impacted approximately 649 million people worldwide to date.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", and a pledge to provide 35 million to Rwanda to end the problem of malnutrition in the county after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives in the US to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on its website, "What do you think can we do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may "have to" resort to its navy to prevent Russian fuel from reaching Middle Eastern countries, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to a description from the Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleges that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new fuel markets.
"I believe that the reason for their position in the Middle East is that they want to be the powerhouse of Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe", he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to address this.
"The United States, with our Navy, has the ability to keep the sea open and if necessary blockade their fuel to ensure it doesn't reach the market", he said.
Zink was speaking to attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He was comparing Washington's treatment of Russia and Iran to the same thing in real life.
"Calling Russia a 'card in the hand' with a fossil fuel-dependent economy", he said, "Iran and Russia's financial options are more about getting benefits from less fuel and replacing it".
The statements come as the Trump administration is seeking to boost LNG exports to Europe, much cheaper for European consumers, rather than Russia.
"As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to dissuade Germany from the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump is being held captive by Berlin and Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the capacity of existing pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a fully cost-effective project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is due to financial reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that fuel cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the power to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has led to a negative reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry association, has called on the United States to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"We have a big problem with any third-party interference in our energy supply", said Dieter Kamff, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator who is not a candidate for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "look into" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was in contention.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women in the top jobs", she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will be running for president with a strong will".
Warren Town Hall during the period voiced his opposition to President Donald Trump, saying that Trump "is leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has faced criticism from Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need an FBI investigation before we vote", Warren tweeted on Friday.
A poll released Thursday found that most of Warren's own voters don't think he should run in 2020.
A Safock University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe poll said that "probably" eighty-five percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the fight.
The poll found that former governor Deval Patrick had the most support for the fight in the polls, with 38 percent supporting a possible fight and 48 percent not.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in the potential 2020 election battle include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reports that Biden has said he will make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes from PTSD by Trump at the rally
Treg Palin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through coming back, I understand other families who are going through PTSD and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little changed, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if the army and air force and military have any respect for their fellow soldiers for what they have given to other countries".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department, he was charged with domestic violence, possession of a weapon and drug possession against a woman.
18 states, DC supporting the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
In support of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
He said that his accomplice "and his violent gang members" had abused him, but that US officials had denied his asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorneys in the states supporting Grace cite El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as examples of countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems, from where large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States come.
The new American Asylum Policy reverses the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Carl Recin, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Friend-of-the-Court brief states that "this federal law requires that all refugee claims be adjudicated on the specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates the original intent".
In the statement, the attorneys also argued that the denial of entry policy to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer shelter victims of domestic violence and gang violence who fled.
"Asylum may be granted to those who have been forced to leave their own country because of persecution or fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy statement on June 11.
Refuge has never been the solution to all the problems - even the most serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
The number of dead doubled in the rescue efforts and the desperate rescue efforts in the Fallu
The situation for the survivors was becoming dire.
"It was very disturbing", said Risa Kusuma, 35, of a shelter in Palu city, to comfort her feverish child.
The ambulances are arriving with bodies every minute.
There is no clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes in an attempt to salvage whatever they could find in the flooded water.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals are overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Doi Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were taken outside the Palau Army Hospital, where they were treated under the sky for the strong aftershock.
He cried as he described the tremors of the earthquake while in a five-story hotel room with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save our own.
I was trapped in the broken walls, apparently", Harris told the press representative, adding that they had come to town for a wedding.
I hear my wife cry for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my kids.
I hope they are safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "propaganda and advertising"
A week after a Chinese state-run newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the American press of using it to conduct a deliberate campaign against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid supplement to Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest Chinese daily, as an attempt by China to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a claim denied by China.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, which US officials told Reuters was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is natural that foreign governments would advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has resulted in them increasing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say that early in the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa who backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time Iowa governor who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
Brannstadt said in an article in the Des Mines Register on Sunday that China has "now doubled that barbarity with targeted advertising in our own free press".
"The Chinese government is taking unethical advantage of America's cherished history of freedom of speech and free press by promoting this propaganda through paid advertisements in Des Moines Register", Bransstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in Beijing you will find limited opposition voices at newsstands on the streets and you will not see a true reflection of the disagreements that the Chinese people may have about China's worrisome economic path, because the media here is run by the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He also said that his article had been rejected by a major Chinese newspaper, though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans want to keep women voters out of the Kavanaugh debate before midterm, analysts warn
Analysts warn that they will see a backlash against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, as he has sided with and shielded several leading Republican candidates from multiple allegations of sexual harassment.
Emotions are running high around the issue, and most Republicans are already publicly looking to move ahead with the vote.
"They can't come back at all", Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rihaar said there were doubts whether last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would appease angry voters.
According to the Washington, DC newspaper, Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Movement group, said on Friday, "Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November".
Protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hallway on Friday morning as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
"Democratic fervor and inspiration will be a thing of the past", independent political analyst Stu Rotenberg told the news site.
People say there are already too many; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among the marginal female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters aged 18 to 29, who don't vote often because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony on allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that Republicans could backfire if he moves forward with the approval.
"It's become a complicated issue for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kafanov will be left behind, it's also about how Republicans have taken the issue and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of the Aoristis USA group, which helps Democrats in the vote, told the news channel.
However, given the testimony of Fords and Kavanaugh, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to whom to believe, with opinions heavily skewed towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably trust Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
It also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flack, the FBI is currently investigating allegations of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh molested her in public at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrappt, is a company that will build the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid gives users the right to choose where their data is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that InRapt's real goal is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of startups.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow anyone to create a P&D or "personal online data store".
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the online data store is that it will depend entirely on the user - who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt will help bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to everyone's solid power.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some contracted on-staff developers and a team of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on InRapt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "are not talking about whether to launch a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed overnight".
We don't ask their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrapt's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as Inrapt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: Clerical celebration of the Victoria Cross of the first world war
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 during the assault on the Bellingleys and the Lehannocts.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
Two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial to him at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extraordantly significant" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Van n led his battalion through thick fog and heavy shelling of field and machine guns during the Battle of the Canal du Saint-Quentin.
He then rushed into the firing line and led the line with the utmost courage, firing only one field gun and shooting three of the enemy.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "something I could never have done and that I have great respect for".
He and his brother Dr. James Van Kuchkawaze then delivered the wreath, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "a true hero's bravery is shown in the support of so many people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to watch 206 Belotto, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a great Bellator 206 and missed the main event.
The original card from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six, and was shown live all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gerard Moussac and Rory McDonald prepared to face each other, the coverage changed to Peppa Pig to the shock of UK viewers.
Especially because of this fight, they stayed up until dawn, so some people were angry.
One fan on Twitter described the adaptation of children's cartoons as "a dirty joke".
"They were forced to change the children's cartoons because it was not appropriate to show such programs at 6am according to government rules", Bellator senior vice president Dave Schwartz said in response to a question about the broadcast.
♪ Peppa the pig, yeah ♪
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that he would work on a schedule that would be geared towards UK audiences in the future.
"We may be able to solve this in the next few days", Coker said.
"But now it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and our Sunday, we can't do it until their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was switched on, there were a lot of messages and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six fights, which is what we normally do, and that's the opposite of what we're trying to give the fans.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly suffers from "sex addiction" because of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he suffered from sexual apathy growing up - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until he went to secondary school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discus presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
She also said that after the birth of her child, her Olympic aspirations have diminished.
The long-running show's regular presenter Christie Young has been on sick leave for several months.
Appearing as a social outcast at Laverne's first event, Daly said she felt "short" of everyone else, because "children's choice was not socially acceptable".
She said: "To this day, it is the feeling of being small and different that has given me the strength and determination to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove herself "something" so that when everyone found out about her sexuality, they wouldn't be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and is using his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality.
She said she opened her mouth because she felt lucky to live in the open without complications and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion talks about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - that "surprised me".
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, and said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find someone her age who had seen so many ups and downs in life.
The couple gave birth to a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daly said his "entire outlook" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I would have said, 'I have to win a gold medal.' That's my meditation knowledge".
In fact, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said that his father never admitted that he was going to die and he ended up asking if their ticket to London 2012 was confirmed - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I never said you would not be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and until he took his last breath and died and I didn't admit that he was invincible", she said.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
He said, "This is my lifelong dream - to dive in the Olympics in front of my own audience, and there's no better feeling than that".
It also inspired her first song choice - Heather Small's Pride - which resonated with her in the run-up to the Olympics and which still stings her.

Mikkelsen, who is off form, will be on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to regain his form if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played in the biennial event a record 12 times, was benched on Saturday's Fours and Foursomes, replacing captain Jim Furik.
Instead of being the center of the action, which he was in the US game, the five-time major winner spent his days working as a cheerleader and refining his game on the range.
Not always comfortable among drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not suited to the Tite Le Golf National Course, where his long ruff often interferes with long shots.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough news, Mickelson, in Game 9, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles matches, can get off to a good start, Mickelson's match could prove crucial.
Furik showed his confidence in him, although there was not much to say.
He also understood his role today, put his hand on my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow.
He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's done a lot for this team this past week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had hoped for more, but it happened and we thought we'd go with it.
He wants to get on the field, like everybody else.
Sunday's match will see Mickelson surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could end a Ryder Cup career that doesn't even go by the side of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Furich says his presence has energized the team.
"He's funny, funny, intelligent, likes to piss people off, and is a great team-room guy", she said.
I think the new players have had a lot of fun playing with him, even this week, which is great to see.
He gives more than just play.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that even the big lead can disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead in the Ryder Cup on the final day of the singles event can create an uncomfortable situation.
The Dane's debut came in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where the team led by Savi Ballesteros gained five points over the Americans, but only by the narrowest of margins managed to cross the finish line and win by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep thinking that we had a big lead in Valdorama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valdorama, where we won, but by a margin", said Bjorn, who is pictured Friday and yesterday winning the 2018 class at Le Golf National 5-3 on a 10-6 lead.
History will show me and the team that it's not over.
Come down with a lot of enthusiasm.
Get out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have one goal, that is to try and win the trophy, and that is where our bird's eye view will be.
I've always said that I look at my team of 12 players, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world.
"I am happy with the performance of our players on the difficult golf course. I will never be too confident about it", Bjorn said.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow will be the individual performance, and that's a different thing.
When everything is going well, it's great to be with a partner, but when you're on the field alone, your abilities as a golfer are put to the ultimate test.
This message needs to be conveyed to all the players, that everyone must give their best tomorrow.
This time, you'll have to leave your partner behind and make the best of it.
Bajorne, on the other hand, will be watching opponent Jim Furyk to see if the players can improve on their individual performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three of their four points.
As part of the team that lost in Europe and won in Brooklyn in the "Miracle in Medina", Furik himself experienced both sides of the dramatic turnaround in the final day.
Asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had cheered his players up before the final day of 1999, he said: "I remember every word".
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'll want to avoid starting as fast as Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game is one-sided, the midfield matches are under a lot of pressure.
We'll make the lineup accordingly and we'll get the guys off the floor the way we thought, we're actually going to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the defence against the top order Europeans with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter. He will face Rory McIlroy in the opening match.
"I have arranged the group in this order because I think it covers everything", Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
The new German battleship is delayed again.
The German Navy's newest unit, the T, was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace previous Cold War-era warships, but will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and the cost of snowballing, local media reported.
The launch of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate "Rhineland-Pfalz" has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the military spokesman was quoted as saying in the daily Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been plagued by post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are reportedly equipped with powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's ports.
However, the continuous delays mean that the advanced warships - which are supposed to help Germany show off its strength abroad - will be obsolete by the time they hit the water, reports Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy has sent a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cite several significant "software and hardware flaws" that would make the ship useless in battle.
The software's asses are especially important, as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the manpower of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it was found that the ship was overweight which would reduce its performance and hinder the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Palace" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is becoming a problem.
The initial level of £2.2 billion has risen to a staggering £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The new frigates, which are in trouble, have become more important in the recent wake of warnings of a shrinking German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bertels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy is "missing ships that are fit for mutiny".
The official said the problem has grown over time, as no replacement ships have been brought in for the older ships that were scrapped.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships had been able to join the fleet.
Sheena gets a sneak peek at the National Trust's secret lives of bats
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands to understand how bats use the ground to find food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help future conservation efforts.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be studying common and soprano piperals and the Dobbenton bat in the Inverview Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at important points around the area to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
Experts will analyse the sound of all the recordings to calculate the frequency of the bat calls and find out what the species is doing.
A landscape map and report will then be created to create a detailed ground-scale picture of their behaviour.
NTS's nature conservation adviser Rob Dan hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as grassland creation and how to protect forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are at risk for construction and development work that damages their sleeping quarters and their homes.
Dangers can also be from wind-based turbines and lights, as can some chemicals from flypaper and building materials, as well as from attacks by pet cats.
The bat is not blind.
However, their night-time hunting habits make their ears more effective than their eyes at catching prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to the bat.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, visit sleeping areas and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson said the estate is ideal for bats.
"There are good areas for Thrive bats", he said.
There are old buildings, there are many old trees and all good housing.
But there is still so much about bats that is unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive".
He emphasizes the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as it can cause the unintentional destruction of a mother bat's habitat to destroy 400 females and baby bats, and wipe out the entire native bat population.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know anything about how many species live".
Ronaldo denies rape and lawyers are bringing a case against the German newspaper
She called the rape allegations against her "fake news" and said that people want to use her name to promote themselves.
His lawyers are prepared to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has made the allegation public.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majerga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was allegedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news" while speaking to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video just hours after the claim went public.
No, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today is fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of life.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well. " The player continued with a smile.
Reuters reported that Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "reporting inadequacies that could be viewed as suspicious in terms of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player must seek compensation for "moral damage of a serious nature, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent times".
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's home after meeting at a nightclub, where he sexually assaulted her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was uncomfortable after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent" "good guy", "disappointed for the one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayurga also claimed that he went to the police and had his injuries photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "scared of retribution and feared being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she now wants to bring the case back up because she is emotionally upset by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the midst of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged offence, and joined Italian club Juventus this summer in a $100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK will regret the loss of its car manufacturing position
Trade Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "always regret" losing its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that the UK told Toyota that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Barnston near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, the delays at the border could cause job losses.
The Barnston plant - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, with about 90 percent of those being exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory could shut down", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Bernston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how to manage cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has said that they will close their mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern that car manufacturers are saying is the risk of a no-deal Brexit in the supply chain.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the ordered vehicle.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border that could delay the supply of parts and lead to a shortage of parts, according to the Chamber of Commerce.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at Toyota's Derbyshire plant, which could cause production to stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations was "properly designed to avoid such checks at the border".
We want to make the best deal that not only sustains success, but also allows us to enjoy the potential of future improvement", he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are proving that it is critical to maintain a successful supply chain".
Toyota is unable to say how long the production shutdown will last, but they warned that in the long run, the extra costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could lead to the loss of many jobs.
Peter Suvaleris, a Bernstone worker for 24 years and a plant unionist, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once they leave, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We need to have a clear and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed further, White House says
Amid the row over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week", the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervised the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The debate in Washington over whether Trump should fire the deputy attorney general and thereby question Mueller's independence has been raging for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on Rosenstein's use of a secret microphone to record conversations with Trump and discussing the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he was reported to have visited the White House on Monday in the wake of reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when Trump was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, after both Kavanaugh and one of the women who brought sexual misconduct charges against him, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no date, it could be this week, it could be another week for all the other current issues of the Supreme Court.
But let's show it, and I always want to tell the media.
Some journalists will disagree with this statement, as Sanders has not held any press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for not holding the briefing was not because of resentment over the "shame" on journalists, though he said: "I don't deny that they did the shame".
He then suggested more direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The current president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said without citing any evidence: "We have estimated that number".
"But it's better if the media has the opportunity to question the president of the United States directly than to talk to me", Sanders said.
We're trying very hard to do that, and you've seen us do that over the last few weeks, and the press briefing is being replaced by a direct conversation with the president of the United States".
Trump regularly takes questions as he leaves the White House or attends press conferences with distinguished guests.
There are very few press conferences.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why unplanned actions and sometimes bizarre appearances can come across in front of a press team.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland fearing Brexit
The Health Minister expressed the country's gratitude to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS and expressed their wish to remain in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter to the EU less than six months before leaving.
The Scottish government has already promised to cover the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens to work in the country's public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: "The UK and EU have been discussing Brexit all summer, with the expectation that it will be concluded this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all going through a very anxious time because of this.
I would like to remind you that the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality, is very important to me.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond have brought in valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and improved healthcare and benefited patients and our communities.
Scotland is your country and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abramby undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
Reed said he was knocked unconscious by the side of the road.
The coach and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sideline and then brought him back for further tests.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that McCrumb was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/type of injury", and that Tennessee State is trying to determine the time of the injury.
The redshirt sophomore is playing his first season with Scramble, Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before being taken out of the game, bringing his total this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under the Tory plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying new property in the UK, and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
This move will undermine Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes that this will raise revenue to provide up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will undermine Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting higher-income groups.
The stamp duty increase will apply to individuals and companies that do not pay UK tax, and the extra money will be used by the government to help the homeless.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, could be more than three percent of what was imposed on second homes and rental homes at higher rates two years ago.
The Treasury expects that this will increase revenues by up to £120 million per annum.
An estimated 13 percent of all newly built properties in London are being bought by non-UK residents, which has driven up prices and made things more difficult for first-time home buyers.
Most of the country's elite areas - especially the capital - are becoming "unfamiliar cities" with a flood of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help younger generations buy their first homes.
She accused large construction companies of buying land and raising property prices without using it, and called on Mrs. Mack to abolish the affordable housing quota to solve Britain's "housing problem".
Mr. Corbyn announced an interesting series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for everyone in the new generation.
And that means fixing the housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it is also not right that foreigners and foreign private companies that do not live in the UK can buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is far from reality, and the problem of homelessness is very real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate dream is to be in charge of Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his "ultimate ambition" is to manage Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is currently enjoying the challenge of recovering the North-East club, who are now in third place in League One, three points behind the first team.
He brought St Maren back to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always drew me back.
This opportunity can only come if I succeed in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager have also included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not disappointed to have rejected established names from big clubs like Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at the moment will be 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
The structure and facilities at this club make it undoubtedly eligible for the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself a success if I could get the club back there".
Ross's manager life is currently just three years after spending 15 months as assistant boss at Dumbarton and on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and the following season transformed St Mirren from relegation gate to championship title winner.
And Ross says he's more comfortable here than he was with a career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real milestone", he recalled of taking over the role of Alloa.
"I really believed that management was better for me than sports.
It's strange to hear because I've done it right, made a living off of it, and enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard.
You have to go through a lot of stuff every week.
I still feel the same way about the pressure of work, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now that I do, it's the most comfortable thing I've had on my own skin in my entire adult life".
You can listen to the full interview on SportsSound on Sunday 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland.
The survey says that 5.30pm on a Saturday is the best time for a pint.
The summer heat wave has increased crowds in Britain's smoggy pubs, but it has also put pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 per cent in July - but revenue from restaurants fell 4.8 per cent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's business consultancy firm, who compiled the figures, said: "The continuous sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup presence means that the same trend will continue in July as last June, with sales of pubs up 2.8 per cent and restaurants down.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The main pubs and bars have done very well so far and the restaurants have done equally badly.
The main food pubs are also suffering from the heat, but they are not selling as well as restaurants.
Looks like people are just out for a drink.
"All pubs and bars saw a 6.6% increase in drink sales this month, with food sales down by three percent".
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "The trend of late April is still ongoing.
Weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest influences on sales in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups will be in a tough situation, but this 4.8 percent drop in sales each year will be particularly painful.
Food cannot come at a worse time for the main operators than the long and hot summer and only time will tell if the mild weather of August will bring some relief.
In July, total sales in pubs and restaurants including new openings increased by 2.7 per cent, reflecting a decline in sales in brand roll-outs.
The UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector's Coffer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor collected and analysed performance data from 47 operating groups, whose combined turnover is over £9 million, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed a rise in "fake Insta" pages
The news raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social media account hidden from adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that Instagram accounts are growing rapidly.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a transparent "main" account to show their parents, but also a hidden one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site saw a teenager urging others to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Elijah Doyle will be the Voice for Athletes at the Scottish Athletic Board
Alid Dowell has been elected as an Executive Director to the Scottish Athletics Board at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle described the move as a great opportunity for Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elidha has a great deal of respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are confident that bringing her to the Scottish Athletics Board will benefit immensely", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am excited to work as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really help and take the sport of Scotland forward".
The American, who won four Olympic golds, including the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 and is now a regular pundit on the BBC, has stopped walking after a severe transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said only time will tell how much I'll recover.
It was a tough job, but now I'm healthy, I've learned to walk again and I'm exercising again today!
Thank you for your inspiring message!
Internet is divided over breast pump ads vs. mother vs. cow
A breast pump company has divided the internet with an ad comparing mothers with breast-feeding cows.
To celebrate the launch of what it calls "the world's first soundless wearable breast pump", consumer technology company LV has released a hilarious music video-style ad that showcases the freedom the new pump gives modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing to a song with a cow in a haystack, the lyrics of which include: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail", and "If anyone sees you, these are not animal legs, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump and bar, pump and bar, I feed the babies, pump and bar, I breastfeed my girlfriends".
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has created controversy online.
The video has received mixed reactions from viewers with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, with many saying it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cattle in the advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk like us, the difference being that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth", one person wrote.
LV breast pump is nicely placed inside a nursing bra (LV/M)
Another commented: "It's obviously frustrating for both mother and child.
But why not use them in breast pump advertisements for mothers who are keeping their babies close?
Another said: "Very unpleasant advertisement".
Others stood by the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "enjoyable".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was a baby-sitter, I'd have one too.
I feel like a cow when I pump.
The ad was a little crazy, but I took it well.
It is an innovative product, " wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a juicy ad targeted at mothers who pump (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and consider themselves "cows".
This ad is not a compliment or a criticism of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women say that they all danced with the pump hidden in their arms.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cows when they pump their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and fits nicely into the nursing braces, which allows women the freedom to walk, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and CEO of Mother, said: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should be launched with courage and excitement.
By drawing parallels between women and lactating cows, we wanted to bring breast pumping and all its challenges into the spotlight, in an entertaining and relatable way, revealing the incredible sense of liberation that the new pump will bring.
LV Pump is not the first news outlet.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two used this product to walk the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's stringent rules and policies have made it harder for children to be held by their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been afraid of losing their own chances of staying in the country by claiming undocumented immigrants and children.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that fingerprints of potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to be submitted, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor orphans.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
"Some 80 percent of the sponsors or sponsors' family members are in the country illegally and a large portion of them are felons.
"We are looking for them", said Nistar Albenz.
In an effort to get children back into society more quickly, officials introduced new rules that include requiring them to appear in court within a month of detention, which was previously 60 days, shelter workers said.
Many will appear by video conference call during their case rather than in person for legal status with the immigration judge.
Those deemed unworthy of relief will be quickly evicted.
According to shelter workers and reports released from the system in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or escape attempts.
Supporters say the concerns are even more acute in large centers like Turnillo, where it has been found that children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They also said that the trauma many are already suffering from can be multiplied if children are taken to the centre without being emotionally prepared or given enough time to say goodbye to friends.
US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' are asked to leave Syria immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalim called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite eight years of war.
Moallem, who is also the country's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on the country's soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate action".
"They must leave now without conditions", he told the council.
Moallem stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes, is almost over.
He said Damascus will continue to fight both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence" until it "cleansed all Syrian territory".
The US has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to provide training and advice to both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
Asked about the refugees, Moallem said that the situation was favorable for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unjustified fear" that has induced refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian agencies to help with the return", he said.
They are making politics of the whole human problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, offers an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, which is home to three million people.
However, Moallem stressed that the agreement has a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that the military action will work against the jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be "eradicated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura expects to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition parties to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moallem stipulated the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and he warned against unwanted interference.
Why Trump will win in the second round
In this argument, Trump will win re-election in 2020, as many liberals probably hope, because of the impeachment and scandal, his presidency will end prematurely.
Which is, without a doubt, "the most dramatic ending of any president!"
So far, there is no sign of a change in the public's opinion.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings at CNN have more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and at MSNBC have tripled to about 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time viewership has risen to nearly 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million last year, according to Nielson, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of the ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on the night of the big news.
Of a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack destroyed the Capitol, Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our understanding".
Veteran comedy writer Neil Scovel and the author of "Just the Funny Parts: And the Hollywood Boys Club's Some Hard Truths to Hide" have another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took before the 2016 elections.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asks.
"He says, 'Because he's funny,'" Miss Scovel told me, "and he's not going to be able to do it.
The chaos has some entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the issues arising from Washington could determine the future of the Row Five.
Touring is a luxury that only the most privileged of audiences can afford.
And yet, it is beyond the comprehension of a sober citizen to see a panel of experts debating for six hours the use of "deep background" for Bob Woodward's "Fearless", the use of Paul Manafort's $15,000 camel-skin bomber jacket (the Washington Post says "the fat suit of the hood") and the brilliant speech of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's, um, anatomical details.
I'll never see Super Mario in the same light again.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pun Stars", said of the Trump show's daily rotating cast and daily plot changes (with the NFL fighting, praising Kim Jong-un), "Some of what he's doing is like a reality show, he's doing something funny every night".
You can't miss an episode or miss watching it.
When we spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was still sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get himself out of the turmoil of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee-confronted and Supreme Court-pending future.
"I remember when we had all the great shows in the '70s and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it's real.

Outside money floods in midterm elections
It is no surprise that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, as two candidates are vying for the same seat, courtesy of the redistricting of congressional districts.
The recently reorganized suburban Pittsburgh District Pitts are bringing on Democratic Representative Connor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, much of which is part of the new 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally aligned in favor of the Republicans, causing the redistricting of the map.
The race for the new 17th district has seen the major parties' funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC), and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), compete in a money-laundering contest.
Lamb gained prominence after winning a narrow margin in a highly publicized special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits are putting Democrats a little ahead.
U.S. severely punishes El Salvador for backing China, later withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, withdrawing from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" led officials to take the decision to repatriate American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
However, only the punishment was announced against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US relief in 2017 in the areas of drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which included financial aid cuts and certain visa bans, could prove painful for the Central American country because of its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity in a move to prevent an influx of immigrants to the United States like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending the possibility of El Salvador's sentence.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, with the administration delivering a message of import.
And the American ambassadors of the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the statements made by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic affairs on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also declined to be named.
Read the history
The next inevitable event may be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's potential obstruction of justice, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller's investigation is turning to whether Mr Trump had any ties with Russia during the election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take his own responsibility, just as he is preparing to go back to the electorate and eventually possibly to a jury with his colleagues.
There are many if-then issues, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, or that of his European counterpart.
The length of the conflict will be a matter of choice for our people on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938 German officials might have "revolted" against Hitler, if the West had not stopped him and sided with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed out on years of avoiding murder.
The course of history often takes such turns, and in it the unstoppable speed of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
There have been similar turning points in American history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was published last year that he secretly suggested recording the president and speculated about his own incompetence in his position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times story was false.
"What would be our response if the newly launched FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is found not guilty by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
The bigger question is, will we elect a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm elections?
If we fail this test, democracy will go into hibernation for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who had occupied my embassy.
He survived, escaped to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the lamp of Shabath on the table marked with the swastika.
With this history, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of the battle for Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and if they win against the Austrians after a thrilling draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they have a good chance of qualifying from Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance played his first game of the season with a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the result will help them get to the next level.
"This point is very important because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the field with confidence and took a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw was probably fair.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday, another big night on the European stage.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in their last game, but I am sure that with the support of the audience we can get a positive result.
Last year was not so good, because of my injuries and all the changes that have happened in the club, there is a good feeling element in the current situation.
Our team is doing well and the boys are having a great time; we are training well.
I hope that we can move on from last season and succeed.
Women's nights are being ruined by worrying about saving for retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had an idea of how to cope with it, very few people spoke to their family members about it.
Nationwide's survey found that half of the respondents said they had talked to their spouse about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not engaging in that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Know where to start.
Talk to your mate and children: If you do not communicate your desires well enough in advance, you will not prepare your family for your ministry.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you want to receive care, as it is also important to determine your preferred cost.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can find solutions to manage these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, or self-insurance with your own funds to help with these expenses if you have the money.
Bar your legal documents for solutions: Try to avoid legal battles.
Have a proper health care proxy so that you designate someone you trust to oversee your medical care and so that if you are unable to communicate, the professional will comply with your wishes.
And, keep in mind a power of attorney for your property.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid correctly in the event of your disability.
Don't forget the little things: Imagine that your elderly parent needs emergency medical care and is being taken to the hospital.
Are you aware of his allergies and current medications?
Put all this in writing so that you are prepared.
"And it's not just economic, it's also medical", said Martik.
What are the current drugs doing?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have everything planned.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle while walking home after a night out.
The victim, Devon, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officials said the "separate" incident occurred at 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police have requested a witness.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
With communications cut off, rescue workers were unable to report any information in the Dongola Regency area north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
From Palau, more than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some important facts about the Palu and Dongala of Sulawesi:
The capital of Central Sulawesi State is Palu, which is located at the end of a narrow cove on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that spans about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is lower than the state, has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of income in Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but most of it is located on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast, in Morowali.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed about 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, which killed nine people.
Indonesia is a seismically active country, located in the Pacific Volcanic Zone, and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: A major earthquake triggered a tsunami off the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, in North Sumatra, on 26 December, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami to strike the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit near the capital of West Sumatra, Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami to strike dozens of villages and kill nearly 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hits Aceh's P.D. Zaya Regency, bringing back memories of the devastation and horror of the 2004 tsunami.
Although there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died when houses collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Treac Paulin, the eldest son of Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Paulin, has been charged with the attack.
According to a report by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Pauline, 29, of Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempting to evade arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew went to call the police in connection with the incident, he took her phone away from her.
Paulin was held in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He was arraigned on Saturday, where he claimed to be "confirmed innocent", the network reported.
He faces a Class A misdemeanor charge, which could result in up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $250,000.
And it's also a class B misdemeanor, which can result in a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Phillip.
Her mother, Sarah Pauline, called the police about the attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence and weapons possession charges.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
The Veterans Group criticized Sarah Paulin in 2016 for linking the boy's violent behavior to his PSTD service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that leveled thousands of homes.
Power and communication systems have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake was felt near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of the wave crashing are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered to participate in the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been given to anyone since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bicycle path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, causing cyclists and pedestrians to swerve.
The death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York states that prosecutors must prove that Saipov was "intentionally" killing eight people and "intentionally" causing serious injury to others in order to carry out the death penalty.
Both of these are sufficient grounds for execution, according to court documents.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges, including eight counts of murder, which are usually brought in the context of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and car wrecking.
The attack, which the Syphilis carried out in a "heinous, brutal and perverse" manner, the lawyers said required "adequate planning and foresight".
Saifullo Habibullayevich Saipov whose family and friends have suffered pain, loss and damage caused by them are Diego Enric Angellini, Nicolas Klaves, Anne-Laura Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlez, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza,  Notes of Intent Estate.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York last executed a man more than a decade ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, expressed no remorse, the court report said.
The police said that he felt happy after the incident.
Sypov told officers that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his home phone, the complaint said.
Police said he also requested that an ISIS flag be put up in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing the SIPV, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than grant a life sentence will prolong the trauma of this incident for everyone involved", Patton said.
The legal team of Saipov had earlier filed a motion to quash the execution of the Consuls.
MP Tory said Nigel Farage should be given the task of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to unite the people-forces in the protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had been "touched by Euroscepticism" - when one of Theresa May's own MPs said she should be given the job of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bown of Birmingham said that if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have already "left" the EU.
But Mrs May's eagerness to keep her deeply divided office in one place was once again clear when the anti-Brexit Tories took part in another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Chequers are trying to keep the deal on the right track amidst the onslaught of pro-Brexit, anti-Brexit and EU attacks.
His allies insisted on a deal with Brussels despite opposition - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and 'disorder'.
Mr. Bon Solihle told the Live Mines Live rally that he wanted 'Chuck Checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a partner and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gotten out of it", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but Chuck Chequers is needed".
To his opponents in the EU: We did not fight the world war to survive
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone ruled out the possibility of a change of opinion after the 2016 election.
Tory Brexit supporter Andre Jenkins was also at the rally, who told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chechers are unpopular, the opposition will not vote for it, and our party people and activists who brought us here are also unpopular.
Remove the checkers and try to listen.
In a sharp tone, he added to Mrs. May: "The Prime Minister is thinking about his post, where he should keep his promises".
Mr Farage told the assembly that if the 2016 referendum decision was betrayed, politicians should be forced to realise the "different situation".
It is now a matter of trust between the people and the politicians, he said.
They are trying to cheat with Brexit and we will tell them that we will not let you get away with it.
Addressing the cheering crowd, he added: "I want the politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face the consequences.
We are leading the mass forces that have brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters held a two-hour rally through Birmingham's city centre.
This weekend, a group of activists formed and displayed a Brexit banner against the Tories.
Adonis, the leader of the Labour Party, ridicules the Conservatives at the conference after a security problem in a party app.
"Some people tell us they can have a seamless border, unimpeded free trade on the Irish border, Canada's plus plus and IT systems fine", he added.
It's a full-blown joke.
A good Brexit is not enough, he added.
Warren is considering a "hard look" on his presidential bid
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat made the remarks during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, speaking about his future.
Warren, who is often critical of President Trump, is running in the November reelection against GOP state candidate Geoff Deal, who was the vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There is speculation that he may run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting with Trump's organizers at the town hall in Holyoake on Saturday evening was the 36th since Trump took office.
One participant asked him about running for president.
Warren responded, "It's time to fix our broken government under a woman".
Arrested for shooting LSU Simms
Baton Rouge, LA police said Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Deaton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of a shooting on Friday, asking for the person in the footage to be identified.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that Wade Simms was killed by a gunshot to the head, 247Sports reported.
Wade was attacked by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, a weapon was found on him, and he confessed to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was immediately arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, started 10 games and played in 32 total games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title, thanks to a win from teammate Sebastian Vettel
This was made clear when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday and said that the Mercedes team's order would play a key role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his own position on the first two left and inviting Vettel to attack his own team-mate.
Vettel left Hamilton behind the crowd and went into the pits himself, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver pitched the next lap and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton was the one who went ahead after a tense fight, which showed that the Ferrari driver made a double move and left the interior empty, risking inadvertently missing the opportunity.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh after the first lap.
He then led for much of the race, then overtook Kimi Raikkonen with a bad tyre and finished fourth.
He pitched on lap 44, but could not pick up any speed for the remaining eight laps, leaving Rykonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valterie fought well all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job of getting in the first round", Hamilton said.
That was bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday after she claimed that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blazy Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the issue directly, instead saying that what was happening in the Senate was a reflection of the "shameful and cruel and lying" mentality of the people.
"This is something that could have happened and the nice thing that has been going on in the Senate over the last few weeks is that you see anger, when you see people who are mean and ugly and liars", he said.
When they see the leak, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
Oh, I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, what have you got?
Remember his answer... you leaked the documents - Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not that.
I didn't leak.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked...no, we didn't, he said, impersonating the senator.
The letter, which was sent to Ford Feinstein last July with a description of the allegations against Kavanaugh, was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had leaked from his office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak anything", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it secret and I did as he said.
But the president was not impressed, and he opened up at the rally on Saturday night: "I tell you what, it was bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the presidency said that Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
They want to regain power at any cost.
Look at the low mentality, look at the ugliness, don't stop them from hurting someone, don't stop them from trampling someone to get power and control, the president said, according to Marme Mediet.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants with the second team to win the league.
Patrick Dyer for the Giants scored two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for their defeat to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game by winning the return match in Dundee on Saturday 5-3 on aggregate.
The Giants quickly advanced to the second round thanks to goals from Patrick Dyer and Francis Bevilacqua.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney tied for the home team lead with a goal from Dyer as the Giants moved forward again.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser for Dundee and Lucas Landvolt Nielson scored the two goals to seal the victory.
Adam Keefe's side are third in the Elite League, having come from behind in Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1 in the final.
The two teams have met four times this season, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dyer's first goal came at 3:35 in the fourth minute with a Kendall McFall, and he doubled the lead four minutes later with a David Rutherford.
The early push was overcome by Sullivan's return to the hosts at 13:10 and then Matt Marquart's equalising at 15:16.
Dyer scored his second goal at the end of the first half to give the Giants the lead.
The home team returned to action and Bouchard again scored a power play goal at 27:37.
Kony and Charles Korkoran helped Milly Nelson to put Dundee ahead of the game for the first time at the end of the second half and eventually held on to the lead to win the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home against Milton Keynes next Friday.
Air traffic controller guarantees life of hundreds of passengers from earthquake in exchange for his life
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died helping to fly a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many more remain missing on the island of Sulawesi on Friday after a massive earthquake triggered a tsunami.
The area is shaking repeatedly with strong aftershocks and people are trapped in the rubble in the pavement.
But despite all his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Palur Mutiyaara did not escape from the terribly overcrowded control tower of the Siss al-Joufri airport.
He went to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely fly.
Then he jumped down, fearing the control tower would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia's Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Syrit said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reports.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palu this morning.
"Our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, with the disaster agency saying that communication between the cities of Dongola, Siggi and Butong has been limited.
The death toll is believed to be rising as many bodies are trapped under the debris that have yet to be recovered, said agency spokesman Sutopo Puroyo Nugroho.
A six-meter high wave wrecked Palut, where mass graves will be prepared on Sunday.
Relief and assistance are being brought by military and commercial aircraft.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "There are bodies coming in every minute.
There is no clean water.
Small markets have been looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is moving quickly to bring aid to the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It's already sad, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you to work day and night on the rescue.
Are you ready?
Earlier this year, an earthquake hit Lambo, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: One person is missing in the Laguna plane crash, according to Air New Guinea
The airline's plane crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, and they had earlier said all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea reported on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
The airline immediately refused to disclose details such as the age and nationality of the passenger.
Some local boaters assisted in the rescue of passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Seven people were taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident is still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane went down in the water before it could reach the runway.
A few witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane went down too low.
"Which is a very good thing", Jens said.
Jens said he and others reached the emergency doors of the sinking plane through the water.
He said the flight crew screamed in fear and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors who were busy repairing a nearby jetty also assisted in the rescue, bringing people ashore in a boat filled with air before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
The Aviation Safety Network estimates that 111 people have died on PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but no accidents on Air New Guinea.
Analysts have been able to place the woman alive at the time of the burning.
Prosecutors on Saturday remanded the case to a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. forensic analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to create a narrative of the night of the deaths of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said he recovered several cell phone records that suggested Telis and Chambers were together on the evening of the death, which is against Telis' previous conviction, the Clarion Laser report.
The information shows that Chambers had his cell phone with him at the time, although he claims he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who police say spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When prosecutors questioned whether Telles was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that "it's a lie, because his truck was in Nashville that night".
Another discrepancy is that Tallis said he knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted text, call and contact information from her phone.
"He's the one who's cut him out of his life", Haley said.
The final argument of the case is scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.
The High Breed: What is Kansas Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative connotations of the genre by bringing a positive message to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, highlights how hip hop has moved away from its mainstream political message and social issues.
They want to get back into their mainstream and make Kansas hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the UK recently with artists such as Akala and Lokki.
Another black?!
New York nanny sues a couple for firing them after a racist text.
A New York nanny sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misleading text from a mother who called her "another black person".
The couple denied the accusations of being racist and sought a trial for allegedly "insulting" them.
Lynsey Plasco-Falksman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment after arriving on her first day of work in 2016 to learn that Giselle Morris, the baby's new caregiver, was black.
Another black woman, Mrs. Plasco-Falksman, texted her husband.
Anyway, he sent it to Miss Morris instead of her husband, twice.
Later realizing his mistake, the "unwilling" Placebo-Falksman fired Ms. Morris. He said that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had done badly, resulting in her expecting a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Miss Morris was suspended for one day and then sent home by Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation in the event of their eviction and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for six months, although she was initially hired as a stay-at-home nanny without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered their claims of being racist by saying that it was reasonable to expel Morris for fear that he would not be trusted after being charged.
He didn't want to tell me what my wife sent.
He is not a racist.
We are not a racist couple", her husband Joel told the Plasco Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you mistreated, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn child?
Tell me about it.
Regarding the allegations of Zulum, Plasco said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you want to go up against someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do, said the investment banker.
The couple's behavior and arguments were strongly condemned on social media by the People's Court as the legal case was ongoing.
Paddington Publications fears that readers may not be able to relate to the talking bear, in a new paper published
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "Before its publication it is difficult to say what the first reader will think.
It's funny to think that after Paddington's big success.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write children's books by the little teddy bear, said he was optimistic about the rejection of his work. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "a big deal" to him after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", said that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a proud man", he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was like your own child had accomplished something: you were proud of him, even though you had nothing to do with it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes in a little bit of this way.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to get a phone call to say goodbye.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nade kept calling saying it was very bad, and that he probably wouldn't survive", Ms. Ednan-Lapéroise said.
Then I got a call from Nad and I found out that she was going to die in a couple of minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
And I did.
I say, "Tashi, darling, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medication that the doctors had given to keep his heart functioning was slowly being released from his body.
He died a few minutes ago, and then it all stopped.
I had no choice but to sit and wait, knowing everything.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouse, then grieving over the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - she was unable to cope with the difficult situation.
"No one knew", he said.
I was down, my eyes were watering.
It's impossible to describe, but I was on the plane and I was experiencing the pain of Ned's death.
That he needs my love and sympathy.
I know how much he loved her.
This woman posted suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can call for help on the Welsh Bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression since he was 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I'm doing this all the time", she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that her smile made the room light up.
However, he quit before he died, because he "really went dark".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him dead.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this effort will be cut short".
Ms. Davis made the card to let everyone know that there are people you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - we need to talk.
Miss Humphries, who was Miss Davis's longtime girlfriend, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
"He never said he was in a bad mood or that he was depressed or anything", she said.
A couple of days before Christmas, I noticed a change in his behavior.
 On Christmas Day, he was very bad - he didn't even look at the children when they opened their presents.
He said that his death was a huge emotional blow for them, but they had to overcome it: it created a huge void in the family.
He tore us apart.
But we must also fight along the way.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI investigates
"I thought if we could give him something that he wanted - because the investigation is limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring some unity", Mr. Fleck said Saturday. He added that he fears the committee might "break up" in the face of this partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their obligations are related to time.
On November 6, just five weeks before the midterm elections - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get the favorites on the nation's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush calls the senators and pleads with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defections have decreased under Kim
North Korea's defection rate has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seung, citing South Korea's Unification Ministry, said the number of defectors last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reason was the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the heavy financial burden on human smugglers.
Pyong has not made any public comments on the matter.
A large number of defectors from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly returns them to their home countries.
Relations between North and South Korea - who are still in the midst of a de facto war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This follows the historic meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, when they agreed to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
In an address to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ri said, "If there is no trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such a situation, we would never unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, "I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever did something like this, she would be called 'hysterical.'"
Kavanaugh has strongly denied the allegation, saying he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blazy when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was emotional during his opening statement, screaming and choking as he spoke about his family and high school life.
He explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the accusation against him a "fun and shady character play" staged by liberals, alleging that it was "in the name of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss".
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit for the Supreme Court, as it proved he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proven himself unfit in the statements he has made and the way he has dismissed Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and the Democrats win the House majority, Pelosi expressed indignation.
"I would say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only not eligible for the Supreme Court, but he's not eligible for the court he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned that Kavanaugh will oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she is a conservative justice herself.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"We cannot allow a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and tell us 'is this great or is this not great,'" Pelosi said.
And women should control it.
It's a debate that's been raging for months and years, and he can't help but cry.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's rare, what do you say?
She also said that she had a female executive who helped her a lot, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she chose this method, when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm really mad.
Then he went on.
I thought it was amazing.
Tears serve as an outlet for anger in part because they are primarily the victims of misunderstandings.
One of my earliest memories of a job, in a male-head office, where I once found myself crying in incredibly anger, was an older woman holding my scarf - a manager I always feared a little bit - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see it.
Patrick Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential election.
When Mr. Hart was caught in a monkey business abroad in 1987 for an extramarital affair and was dropped from the competition for dirty jobs, deeply frustrated Ms. Schroeder thought there was no reason why she should not run for president herself.
"It was not a very deliberate decision", he said with a smile after 30 years.
Seven other candidates are already in the race, and another candidate is unopposed.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
He was late with the fundraising due to the delay in the campaign and so he vowed that he would not run until he had raised $2 million.
It was a battle of wills.
He noticed that when a male supporter was given $1,000, he was only given $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" he asked in surprise.
When he announced that he would not run a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude to his supporters, frustrated with the system that made it difficult to raise money, he targeted voters by excluding representatives, and became sick with anger over sexism.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder said, recalling the media reaction.
You might have thought that Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, where are they gonna bury me?
Did he cry?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first phase of the US-China trade war has been a heated one, and when the war is in its final stages, Beijing could benefit from the conflict in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year of tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable passage was this week, when new duties were imposed on almost half of total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (£150 billion).
Beijing has retaliated as usual - most recently by raising tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of US goods.
China has decided to fight with an eye to an eye and the world's second largest economy is not likely to let its eye down anytime soon.
It would be highly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping to back down on Washington's demand for money, but publicly bow to the US.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play the cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could help China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Any hasty political decision by Washington or Beijing that could lead to a collapse in both countries is more dangerous than what the Wakibahal Mahal is thinking", said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the think tank Center for New American Security, who specializes in Asia.
Syria is ready to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees, and has called for the reconstruction of the country devastated by seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalim said that the situation in the country is improving.
Today, the situation is stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The Government has continued rehabilitation to restore normalcy in the areas devastated by terrorists.
The conditions are now favourable for the voluntary return of people who have been forced to leave the country due to the disruption of their daily lives and livelihoods due to terrorism and the surrounding economic conditions.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muwalem said the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in the reconstruction of the country.
However, he also stressed that no conditional aid will be accepted or help from any country that supports the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe defeated Team USA by a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France to win the 2018 Ryder Cup.
The U.S. lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Team Europe, led by Danish captain Thomas Beynes, reached the required 14.5 points to defeat the United States and regain the title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had not played well for most of the tournament, hit his tee shot on the par-3 16th hole, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari, who has been a standout all round, is one of only four players to score over 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth, the lowest ranked player in Europe, has been beaten 5-4 by Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia has the most career points in Europe with 25.5.
I don't normally cry, but I couldn't cry this time.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you, Thomas, for electing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad to have the cup back.
It's the team's success, I'm happy I was able to help", said Garcia, who was moved by the European win.
He handed the lead to his countryman John Ram, who lost to American legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's singles 2-1.
"I am very proud of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said John Ram, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France, and his Ryder Cup record stands at 13-21-3.
That's an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to top-ranked Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been stumbling all weekend except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been showing high-quality performances.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
We had a little pressure on Europe this morning.
We didn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We'll turn around, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to show them respect.
We didn't make it to the game.
Red currents update: Reduced concentrations in Pinellas, Manaati and Sarasota
A new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission found a general decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are bloom conditions of pachy in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties - a sign of decreasing density.
The Red Stream Bloom extends for approximately 130 miles along the coastline from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
The patch can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but has been less visible than last week.
Red currents have also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations were reported in Pinellas County on and off the coast, low to high off the coast in Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manatee County, high concentrations in Sarasota County on and off the coast, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations in Lee County on and off the coast, and low concentrations in Collier County during the past week.
Respiratory problems are still being reported from Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems from northwest Florida in the past week.
