a vault or caretoid-colored bottom, says scientist.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feather does not have a well-developed shell, also called the rhachis, but it does have other features of feathers - shells and bearded side branches - and the researchers have concluded that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.

Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents them from competing with others.

Lions have one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and young.
The wives are usually closely related to each other, constituting a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave much like a herd of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly close to lions (but not to other large cats) in action, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.

oselotte animals (prey) are thought to follow and find by smell.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move invisibly. Parrot cats hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then jumping on their victims.
When a small group of living things (a small population) are removed from the main population from which they come (such as when they cross a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island so they can't easily retreat) they will find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
The new environment has different resources and other competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
This process is called spacing, which means just the formation of a new species.

While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts that included wild boar, fox, snail, and a type of wildlife known as a hazel mouse.
Other difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included food that came to Europe from America, or from Asia in later centuries.

Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods that was considered the home of the god.

Temple each had an open courtyard and then an inner room where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, also sufficient ziggurats, are built to be part of the temples.

Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red is told to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.

Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
IF YOU have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that there was a treasure card written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776. The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parking document (it measures 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for scrap.

D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but still the south was not free.
Vichy French controlled them. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of baking with them.
On the 15th of August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion became known as Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned them over to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people who work together and live and work as a community.

A civilized culture that is based on the transmission of knowledge across many generations,a perpetual cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congressional powers were not imposed on taxation, and, as there was no national executive or court, they relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, to execute all their acts.
Nor had it any authority to transgress tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles require the unanimous consent of all states before they can be changed and states take the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.

Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
n archipelago is often referred to as Japan from a geographical point of view because of the island group Japan has.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by to adopt the island's name as Ilha Formose, or beautiful island.
1624 The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, and a transformation into native grain production practices by hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644  1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Policy, by which they transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have already been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been destroyed, and restoration continues to this day.

35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The image ratio of this format (by dividing twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates motion while maintaining some degree of order in an image.

During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under the spotlight.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone; from the king to the members of the community.

For over a thousand years the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, the British initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Strategy has proven effective; it has cut vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade has broken generally accepted international laws by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering large parts of the ocean, which would mean danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.

Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also between each dynasty a volatile period of divided provinces.The most famous of these periods of the Three Kingdoms period that took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was a bitter warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history; with thousands of people dying in the struggle to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.

Diesel is true for the military, as the army ranges are now based on caliber, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He frequently visited a cave that became known as Hira on the Mountain of Noor (light) for reflection.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.

The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramidal structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
Giza Plato, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.

The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are obliged to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay off a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds has been driven by Wall Street bank buildings in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the extensive exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple servants, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determination is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological necessity in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic accompanied by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most disruptions of technological determination share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself  follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn,  produces effects on societies that are indigenous rather than socially conditioned.

A wide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, however, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment formed individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that environment emerged, and these things, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was counted as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts like herbs and spices of higher value than Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, western styles can be left behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Near the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was the crusades that began with knots for making clothes.
Agriculture is agriculture done to produce only enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Crop farming is a simple, organic system that preserves seeds that are native to the ecosystem combined with alternate farming or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characteristic of the members' age, ethnic origin, status, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
A membership of a subculture is often indicated by the characteristic and symbolic use of styles, which include fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up by neglect, unfavorable circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some wild children have been entangled by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is attributed to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some have remained alone in the wilderness.
When a wild child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it displays behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular caring animal, such as the fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, stewardship goes one step further.
Taxation is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are beginning to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Teacher is a form of teacher but so is the little slider male in Microsoft Office.

A wide range of reasons for the placement of children in foster care range from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the Nursing System as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were suspended in the home from where they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and reward approach.
learning and socializing, for example, are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, their Personal engagement and Continued relationships were identified as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his document, The President's Speech, showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.

The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins, which are found in leaves and pollination, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal coats (anthers, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
In all, we should not be surprised if our predecessors solved their own protein problem in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep for a short time afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to put it down.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates with the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force present.

Kundalini Yoga is used to stimulate Kundalini energy (energy of relief) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a joint enemy in World War II, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and the clashes of system, process and culture that led to the countries falling.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies became present enemies and the Cold War began.

By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize alongside the Roman bridgehead.
Whatever the case, these plans were executed overnight, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Agreement, and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleet was traditionally to ensure that your country retained the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII.

Had the Allies failed, Germany would most likely be able to conquer Britain as it could conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first made in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in flocks that walked over the hills and other pasture areas, and were looked after by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widespread shepherds.
Wastewater was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails were mostly made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses they dragged to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would take to do so on the rougher roads of the day.
Bars were fitted fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, gradually it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was an iron strip at the top.

Why do transport systems raise such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?Are transport intruders just incompetent?Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers operate within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of driving-level facilities.

Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is of certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that makes them do certain good or not do it.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
One side of the spectrum is to remain one of the men (or girls).

A person at the other end of the spectrum changes to an unrecognizable individual who feels like he or she needs to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior sometimes causes a breakup between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet at different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and wisdom can flourish.
As a result, the process of an organization works together to overcome the obstacle and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.

For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a webcast about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is re-modeled, but old versions are kept online and serve as a booklet.
Web journals can also help improve students' writing ability. While students regularly begin their web journal experience with dirty language use and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journalist begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces the student to become more adept about the world around them.) The need to feed the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as to develop their own perspectives on certain boxes (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and houses a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagra Falls and the north hosts the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding area.
All these and more characterise Ontario than true Canadians are perceived by outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.

Wives: It is recommended that any female traveler say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it's one that doesn't seem expensive).
Wives should realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon for them to be persecuted, held in arms, etc.
Be firm when turning men away, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.

The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was the name given Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to shop in all of Morocco.
To the old Medina it is easy to find places that have traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cookware, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of excesses, but it's as for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Far East near Rwanda.

While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of fighting in North Kivu province.

Timbuktu, combined with its relative inaccessibility, is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Timbuktu is today a poor town, though its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the dangers of desert sands.
This was one of the main standout points during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabic flair than that of an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.

Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared to a glittering column chart accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best scenery of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is heavily packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the interior of Bangladesh and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls into Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not merely halophyte swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/ marshy areas.
Sundarbani has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now some 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going in an eastern direction, depart between 06:30 and 07:30 to Jakar/Bumthang.
As interdistrict buses are often crowded, it is suggested that one buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and robust.
Shared rental cars are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), for example.

The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also applied subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as The Great Province of the Indies, was born as a result of the skirmishing of Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.

Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures barely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
Rain anddry seasons are not specific: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, nature is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
