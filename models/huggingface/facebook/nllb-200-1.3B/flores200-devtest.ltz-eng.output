This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils normally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional order.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were coarse-grained with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (called a spindle), but other features of feathers included beards and rays, the researchers concluded that the spindle was probably a late evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature control or appearance. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample came from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a younger one.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample came from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a hippopotamus.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and injuring more than 20 others.

The light and rotation are combined to determine the Rossby number of a star that is associated with the plasma stream.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less the star is active in terms of magnetic rotations.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth and causes storms, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin, put a pre-printed sheet of paper that lists their candidate for the vote in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the wallet and signs on the ballot.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies procedures.
Since 1988, the curtains have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes on them at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are attached except those of the duly selected and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see each part of the process. In the evening, the voices of volunteers are counted under strict supervision according to special procedures.

This is common in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have deemed the release of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish pictures of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting the entire case, told reporters that it would not comment further until the charges were filed.
The document refers to the disputed border area claimed by Palestine on the basis of the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Further topics seem to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to allow this presence for only five years.
The guards in the supplemental pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers as the study is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of parks and heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four selected shooters for the first shooting were given extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional Walrot (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, which have been partially due since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that one in 27 accidents is related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 more cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded to the report's absurdity by calling it "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (Friday 9:19 am GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported throughout the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, just as the Philippine photographers had done.
The photographers later replaced an older dam that had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm babies in his spare time.
His research showed that when given a hormone, it would accelerate the fetal maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government officials recovered two blackboxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even a little more... I love her and miss her... hopefully she's on a better time".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia as a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she was of the opinion that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
To the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain because it was forbidden during the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware until early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been accompanied by organic substances that form proteins and can support life, a source of water supplies to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed, because comets have collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo took office as governor at age 53 earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and stupidity".
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly short distances and save millions of tons of fuel and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport used and no overhead stops at Wembley and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of feeling transported increased the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to the collision between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the encountered cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be made into thin wire, which can be bent and crushed, and it can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and be applied to other metals, and it can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings and books, called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using raw cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and press them with clean, wet hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which fall off and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a lavatory in almost every house, connected to a specialized sewage system.
Relics of sewer systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman world, they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed society.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're missing a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in our view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in unspeakable ways. The greatest advantage we owe to the wheel is a much faster and easier means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more moderate-sized cats, which eat medium-sized catches from rabbits to antelopes and wild game.
After all, there are many small cats (including free-ranging house cats) that feed on the much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specific task that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are solitary cats that live in large groups, also called herds.
A herd consists of one to four adult males, along with up to thirty females and males.
Women are usually close relatives, for they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lovers behave like the animals of the forest or dogs - animals that are surprisingly like love (but not other gifts) in their behavior - and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can glide (if not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's cry is not like the full-blown cry of a love, but rather like a phrase twisted, twisted words.
Ozelotes like to eat small animals, they catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that eat the ozelot are much smaller than him.
Scientists think that ozelots follow and find animals for food by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark at night and move well. Ozelotes chew their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then attack them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they were moving across a mountain or a river, or if they were moving to a new island and could not easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one in which they were before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population adapts to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species again.
We call this process speciation, which is simply the formation of a new species, and speciation is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and produce our clothing from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long beak was filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional straw on the gum, meaning that no one escaped for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, and it may have eaten snails, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He also grabbed everything that came into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T-rex could pick it up with him.
Although most of their food was known to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual meals, including wild boars, beetles, snails, and a type of rodent called the sloth.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate on the couch, rich men liked to be invited to their own banquets and sit at the side of the table.
Meals in Ale Rome could not contain any of the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
They had corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no old Roman ever ate a dumpling.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they claimed was the home of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
In ancient times, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open pools on the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences in terms of people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Templar's Legacy", you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even though there's something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in his life.
So it is likely that the wording was simply added as a description.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and had joined Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly larger group of people living and working together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilized, and is related to the Latin civis, which means mountain, and civitas, which means city or city state, and also somehow determines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a continuous cultural footprint and an orderly diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government  with Congress as its sole component.
Congress had no power to raise taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor does it have the authority to impose tax laws and excise duties between states.
The clauses required unanimous approval by all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government to task, so their representatives were often dismissive.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1-motor sports.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipel".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the core production of the Urawa and hired Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty troops (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
The most commonly used photographic format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but mainly its aspect ratio was taken over by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually something that you can adjust a little bit, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is denoted here as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family) correspond to this aspect ratio or approximate it.
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
Note that the most effective location for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put on the spot.
For a thousand years, the Christian religion held the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Her all-pervading power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money is specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by more international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire stretches of ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
As there was only a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a definitive response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) at Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras: each phase of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an uncertain period with divided provinces. The most famous of these eras was the Three Kingdoms Epoch, which lasted 60 years and spanned between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war broke out between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to grab it.
The same is true of the military, because instead of army lists based on class they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged other tyrannized workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of this worldly life. He repeatedly visited a cave known as 'Hira' on Mount Noor (Light) for contemplation.
The veil itself, which has endured for centuries, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find them, even if you knew they existed. Once you're in the hole, you're completely isolated.
You can only see the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. If you are in the deep, you can only see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the late Pharaoh.
The Um Giseh Plateau, or "Giseh Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and several of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were erected to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The "top tree" looks like a V and the "bottom tree" looks like a bracket or square, with the bottom missing.
Uve means that you should start at the top and press the bou and below means that you should start at the top (where your hand holds the bou) and press the bou.
A high pitch usually generates a quieter tone, while a low pitch is more powerful and decisive.
Don't hesitate to mark your own markings with the powder, but remember that the printed tree markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be included.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of merchants from Versailles.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and screaming against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a mob participant held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, so a large part of the spending and interest on the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits that result from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the eras of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000  1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices; from the technology-push or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying guiding logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely driven by cultural or political influences and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially determined.
For example, one might say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a bunch of cars until new production methods are developed to reduce the cost to the car owner.
Mass motorisation also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures were created that were connected with this geography, and which were, because they were in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Their status during the twelfth century was diminished mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the Byzantine culture in the East had a very strong influence on Gezei.
However, the stars in the West could be trapped 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments from that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use knots to attach the signs.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
A subsistence economy is a simple, often biological system that combines the sums derived from the ecoregion with the yield or uses other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, and they enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be unchangeable on the basis of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unchanging and symbolic style of use, encompassing fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to question the importance of socialization is to look back on some lucky cases of children who were not socialized while growing up by neglect, bad luck or male abuse by adults.
Some wild children were held by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this was the child's task to return to the abode of the parents' severe mental or physical abuse.
Young runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they gave up or fled.
Some should be eaten by the beasts; some should live alone in the wilderness.
If the child is raised by non-human animals, it displays behaviors (with physical limits) that are almost completely similar to those of the respective pet, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that supports people who are taking on a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a school teacher is a form of scaffolding, but the same is true for the small office clamp in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is taught in the software and should ask, ask, and explain tasks that might be too difficult for the student to handle on his own.
Children are given to care institutions for financial reasons, which range from neglect, abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, social and educational, but it is now.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our care system is designed to provide a safe home, carers who are well-mannered, stable training and reliable health care.
The caretaker shall furnish all necessaries which are lacking in the house from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent properties of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal commitment and lasting relationships were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions  facial movements of a few milliseconds .
First of all, it is claimed that one can tell whether a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand language because of deafness are able to accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities are shared in the interpretation of human behavior by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twenty-century research has shown that there are two pools of medicinal variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move the variation with each generation between the two poles back and forth.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to meet its amino acid requirements with the available plant resources.
And there are serious consequences if you don't: growth depression, under-education, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to access would have been the proteins and leaves and legumes, but they are hard for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a wealth of proteins containing all the necessary amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep shortly thereafter (10  60 minutes later).
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively slow alarm clock to bring you to consciousness, but not to wake you up completely.
When you put the clock back on while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room until you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is correlated with the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can seek enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own relaxation and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been extended through the Mahayana Path of Love and through many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guru Yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the collisions of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had developed into enemies, starting the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be played out in real time by proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in scant other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were almost dashed overnight, however, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army marched to the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The need for ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods while at the same time disrupting its enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies defied them, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated as early as 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples considered them to be easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Household horses were kept in the rows and stairs that wandered on hills or other pastures, often led by horses, often children and adolescents, as if they were familiar to the far-off places. This method of hunting is still used today.
Thin-walled tunnels were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the trenches were mainly composed of parallel wooden tunnels, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
Although railway sills were introduced early to keep the rails in place, it was gradually discovered that rails were more efficient if they had an ice bar on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wires of the winches.
Finally, wooden ropes were replaced by iron ropes. In 1767 the first railways were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they used to.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment, but if we want to find the root of the problem and not just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and we should eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that humanity's scientific and technological advances have dramatically changed the world and that the problems have grown because of the overpopulation and excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who delivered it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25-Dunlap flying saucers, of which we know they still exist, are the oldest copies of the document.
Today, paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered as binary digits  or bits (to use computer language).
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as fractures are common enough to not be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of underground poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
The label contains specific first-aid instructions for each poison.
The term gum is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and bed bugs are bed bugs that have adapted to life in the wild or to the housing of their word.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the spinal cord, spinal cord, and spinal cord.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a child.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their babies.
In the case of adoption, the birth parents give up their parental rights until another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method, which is definitely the main focus of scientific research.
But it doesn't do that alone, experimenting  and an experiment is a test that is used to test one or more of the possible hypotheses  asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In physiology and behavior, observed rhythms often depend decisively on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that can continue for a long time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-an-Chase experiment was one of the first proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that weathers the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cell is a stem cell.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere could have resulted in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit nature reserves to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their workplace and drive past those whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport hub, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on private cars, and supports it.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they arise every day? Are transport planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental that is going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, because the driver's behaviour cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a uniformly consistent area; here traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically graphically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find prey and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to spread their wings along the body.
This gives them more space to hide from predators.
Today, waterfowl and day-old ducks are the only insects that cannot flap their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but others assumed otherwise; that the solar system would move around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, since the earth does not feel as if it were moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, measuring just over 6 miles [9.7 km] in width.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical performance of the construction of the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most government officials, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in natural form and can be broken down relatively easily by primitive processes.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma; although he also theorized that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surreal small that billions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the dust was a good friend to many people when it was discovered.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the pencil has become less important and less used.
People now write messages on computer screens without the need for a spy.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to combine a cell nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy wound rolling up a cylinder, the division of the cell nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they break with little or no excitation.
The lunar surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The coastline is about 70 km on the foreshore and about 100 km on the reverse.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker over the highlands.
There may be more mares on the recessed side because the coating is thinner. It was easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out how people click or what they're challenging.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are memorized as they enter adulthood.
This theory considers what it means to certain people to want the things they want, and what things in their environment make them want certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of necessities and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the colleagues".
This type of leadership has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, carrying out performance evaluations, delegating responsibility and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become the unrecognizable person who feels that you have to change everything that the team has done and own it.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the crew.
Virtual teams are maintained to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a liaison for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in the appropriate time zones, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organisation? One of the goals of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional areas of an enterprise, creativity and resourcefulness can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
For an organisation to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuum use as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical use for the study of cognition, and in doing so they are bringing the field of research into focus and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI is a very important area of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and the intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and time planning, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
AI is now commonly used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it is also embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions make up a large part of every class. Often a school teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing virtual excursions is a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
Each year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is updated each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a compilation album.
Blogging can also help improve student writing.While students often start their blogging experience with basic grammar and spelling, the literacy of an audience changes that in general.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to better relate to the world around them". The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of comments from others and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka Mountains and beyond.
All these things and more elevate Ontario from what was previously seen by foreigners as typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly thinly populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
And a population comparison, which surprises many, is that there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself in terms of flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the main route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women say they are married, regardless of actual family status.
It also helps to wear a bracelet (just don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be bullied, to be bullied, etc.
Don't be too hard on men and don't be afraid to speak up (cultural differences here and there, that's not right either).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tajins, faïencerie, leather goods, hookahs and a whole lot of geye wool are sold, but all of that is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is somewhat secure, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trips in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get you to Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and adds an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the World Heritage List due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and straddles the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which feeds different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park admission fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the area of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as a main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering ball diagram illustrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon promenade.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove swamp in the world and extend from the coast over 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangroves - they include some of the last remaining populations of the vast jungles that once stretched across the Ganges.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/supply areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 king tigers and over 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses run all day from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
Since cross-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two 3.5 meters wide footings.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control is expected to be complete.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day Paraguay and as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Rice Province of India", was born as a result of the merger of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
For the Spanish, the colonial era began, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo games, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West business.
The British pound is usually used throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and US currency are accepted; check in advance with the owners, which is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures are usually above +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no particularly "refining" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although wild animals in the park are used to seeing people, the animal kingdom is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authority, you should keep at least 100 yards away from bears and cattle and 25 yards away from any other wildlife.
Whatever their appearance, bison, elk, elk, bears, and so on can attack any large animal.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so keep their distance.
Also, be aware that spicy beers and other wildlife attract them, so avoid the drying or cooking of strong-smelling foods and keep the camps clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, with a population of just under 40,000, and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval incident in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the highest ranking leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches around Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (at the North Harbour area) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour and the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded with family trees with a good selection of shops along the coast.
There are two local beers, the most important one is "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but it's a take-away; the other one is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must try, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be easier to get there.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but mineral water is easy to find if you're not sure.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is exotic, a short black coffee called espresso, cappuccino with a splash on top (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa is Belgian standard. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many rafts are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the raft are rare.
Nevertheless, ask the authorities for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cyclones have been occurring since 1770 from October to April on the beaches and estuaries.
Sharks do, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can feel secure that they can sleep in when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation such as camping sites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages which include coffee, airport transport or even combined flight and hotel baggage.
They can also make the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer again or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the music festival participants choose to camp on the site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be in the moment, you have to get up early to get a camping spot next to the music.
Remember, even if the music on the main stage ends, there may still be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the passage of ice can cause quite a nasty commotion for those most affected.
Cruise tours to St. Petersburg include time in the city, cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time spent by customers and the money spent.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests on the lookout and on the property.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house. But alcohol challenges judgment and all good players know how important it is to stay neutral.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on the dirt and snow roads is low, and it is not possible to drive as if you were driving to Makadamm.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep one stuck.
The visibility may also be restricted by falling or scorched snow or condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted for most of the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to cross-country trips to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you see them better with a lens.
A trekking safari (also called "hike", "walk safari" or "walk") consists of hikes, lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at various locations across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation guidelines do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a stretcher and stretcher that can be rented even when you are not in the room.
If no track is available, or you don't feel like wearing stretch socks, you can try using a fone if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (where it gets into it or in extreme cases, which can lead to burns).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different effects, and if you are concerned, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests in their home areas that they are not familiar with.
Pests can eat food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods at certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often runs through remote forests.
If you are used to driving on country roads, then take your shoes off: cross ladders, narrow alleys and sharp curves.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 56  64 km/h (35  40 mph)  and adhering to them strictly is even more important than ever.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, just like those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit cakes are a daily staple; apples are baked all year round and cakes and crisps and crêpes are added in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts and other legumes. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you are looking for small but rich pastries, try what is offered by the region as berliners, pancakes or crab cakes.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "to a bowl" depending on the liquid content.
In the coastal regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an overview that encompasses a wide selection of regional cuisines from across the nation.
However, when used without further labeling, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavours of Javanese cuisine being cacao, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
And thou shalt make them for the rider's footstool, and hang them on the two sides of the saddle-bag.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can cause safety concerns as the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider is hit by a horse but one foot remains hanging in the saddle, he may be hit if the horse is running.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a talc and a smooth, rather narrow, sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety pins that allow a climber to fall off the saddle if he is chased by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley  the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with rare large granite walls and rocks.
Some offer stunning views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes between the endless potential of the walls.
Descent sports, which include canoeing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which riding, snow-covered terrain with a layer attached to the feet or descending a snowboard is a common activity.
Boating is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are occasionally called "boat enthusiasts" and plan their entire holidays around boating in a particular place.
The idea of the navigator is very old. Hell's paintings depicting navigators date back to around 5000 BC.
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first Norwegian recreational cycling club was founded in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called tourshilaf, ski tours or ski hiking.
It is related to, but not usually associated with, alpine tours or mountaineering, the latter of which takes place on rough terrain and requires much stiffer skiing and footwear.
Think of the trail as a walking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot  but very rarely do you reach the speeds of the run without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through more countries would mean having to apply for a visa and pass through passport checks.
The bed-room functions in this sense somewhat like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes handmade antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
