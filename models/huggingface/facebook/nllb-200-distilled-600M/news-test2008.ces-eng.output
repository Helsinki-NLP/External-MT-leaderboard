Inflation in Europe has jumped because of food
The accelerating inflation rate in the euro area is mainly due to the constant increase in food prices.
In November, prices in the 13 euro area countries rose above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1% recorded in October after 2.6%, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian issuers, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate, with the reduction, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below 2%, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must 'switch off' inflation so that it will not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation was a 15-year record of 3.3 percent; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has been upsetting due to rising food and energy prices.
Wheat prices have risen 88 percent over the year, and soybean prices have also reached their highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 there was a substantial increase in the payment of food oils and milk products.
The price of oil on the world market has risen 52 percent this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold was worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1% this year to 2.5% in 2008 but will already fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% over the next three to four months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesz supporters' circle has grown significantly since the end of the decade, and is now the largest since 2002, while the Gallup Institute has never targeted such low support - 13% - for socialists.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference would represent more than two thirds (71%) of support compared to a five-fold support for the CFP, given the greater determination of the opposition voters.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are under the threshold of parliamentary representation, with support for them in the whole population at 2%.
Among some party voters, the two camps have one percent more supporters.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even from the previous low - never before has the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while 46 percent say it is quite bad.
Families are now once again more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after the more promising spring and summer prospects.
As for next year, a larger proportion of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth to improve.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, the highest of any Gallup poll to date, said the prime minister is doing his job more badly than well.
13 percent of respondents believe in or strongly believe in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent support.
The Prime Minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the Fidesz leader by 27 percent.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While the government and prime minister were considered desirable by 35 percent after last year's October unrest, today that share is only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing a solution only in the run-up to new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is noteworthy that 60% of respondents answered a question about their possible participation that the referendum would certainly come and another 20% said it would probably come.
By comparison, "the parliamentary elections scheduled for this Sunday" would certainly have only 55 percent of the vote, and another 15 percent would consider their participation likely.
The school would say no to 74, the doctor's fees 79 and the hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same percentages only in a circle of people who are sure to promise to participate, then the introduction of tuition, doctor fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more expensive than Tesco.
The hypermarkets in the Budapest business triangle maintained a 16 per cent increase in prices last year on average, with the exception that there was no VAT increase this year.
The newspaper Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas shopping basket for Napi Gazdaság in the Budapest business triangle this year grew by an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets the price increased by over a thousand forints.
Since food prices 'floated' in December last year, the percentage of the previously high base was not so drastic.
But consumers are certainly unhappy that what they could easily buy for under 9,000 forints last year will not be bought for 10,000 now.
The daily economy consumption basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological threshold of 10 000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 the cost of the consumption basket was HUF 6 800.)
The price of unicorns and live fish has remained almost at last year's level, but they have greatly increased the price of crude breasts, nuts and also mackerel.
The prices of bread and flour were in line with the figures of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go below the price of the product of 200 forints.
Also, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter recalled bottle of Coca-Cola was less than FUR 200 and that even with a down payment, the product cost only FUR 257.
However, this year, according to Napi Gazdaság Auchan's consumer basket, Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Napi Gazdaság's daily shopping cart prices have risen by 15 percent compared to last year's Cora Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by about 18 percent.
Comparing last year's high and this year's lowest consumption basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's low and this year's high is 21 percent.
The forensic increase was an average of 1,880
The average price increase last year was forint 1 206 with prices affected by VAT increases last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and the houses of commerce were obviously unable to decide how much price range to set for individual products, as they could not predict the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the product's turnover, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the turnover intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of Napi Gazdaság's consumer basket has risen so sharply last year that the price of the most expensive basket was forint 1 720 higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was forint 844 more.
This year the difference was not so extreme, the most expensive basket now costing 1 630 forints more than last year and the cheapest basket also increased by 1 284 forints.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, prices have risen dramatically, with daily consumption of goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This is not entirely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office, among other things: it has recorded price increases of more than 30% in the case of several basic foods over 12 months.
In addition to flour, eggs, for example.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible on the daily economy consumption basket, since the price level of the product, which was quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely more than 10% on a basic basis even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers appear to be more powerful than the egg suppliers, and the drastic price increases have been imposed on international chains.
The hypermarkets in the Golden Triangle of Commerce aren't complaining, they're always referring to a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores we visit no longer care about prices.
They buy everything quantum, they take the sustainable food after the paycheck.
On Wednesday morning, long lines of bookmakers were formed in all three supermarkets as the number of visitors increased sharply.
But as we know, the turnover is lower in the countryside, and many international chains complain to research firms that they are falling behind their plans, not only in terms of food but also in terms of durable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being saved
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection were reported in hospitals, primarily due to inappropriate antibiotic use.
Hospital hygiene conditions, overcrowding of beds, overload of staff to stop the infection are not helping, says the National Epidemiology Center's primary.
In many places, disinfectants are also being spared.
Recently, the trauma department at St. John's Hospital diagnosed an MRSA infection.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same area earlier this year.
The patient who was injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon afterward he had to return with MRSA infection and one major operation was not yet possible due to the bacteria in his system.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, Primary Director of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, the rest are unknown.
Nearly two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by AS (e. g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are given in excess or inappropriately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics will develop into a bacterium that is highly resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Sepsis can cause serious hospital infections, such as morning infections or blood poisoning, especially in patients with weakened bodies, low body weight, or old age, if their immune systems are temporarily or permanently dysfunctional.
According to the chief medical officer of St. John's Hospital, MRSA is not a special infection, similar infections are common in hospitals.
"Infection should not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there", Tibor Nyulasi said, "where the presence of the disease is not investigated".
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the healthcare staff treat them in rubber gloves and masks and we have the antibiotics we need to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are first tested for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA-related hospital infections could be prevented, but the current rates and conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is characteristic in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should check patients admitted and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund this investigation is also a factor.
Most cases are detected when a patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, the primary epidemiology center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to strive for targeted antibiotic therapy or microbiological testing to prevent drug resistance, but this is not always the case in hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in the primary or ambulatory treatment of patients, Karolina Böröcz said.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence suggests that MRSA is most commonly transmitted to patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but serious deficiencies exist in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by both capillary infection and touch, but in home hospital conditions, it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, rooms are often crowded, and beds are often very close to each other, although epidemiologically patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
As Karolina Böröcz pointed out, unfortunately, we also find that in hospitals in poor physical condition, disinfectants are being spared, nurses are few and patients are many, which increases the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there is a demonstrable reduction in such infections or the further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it's being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has a programme to prevent or reduce MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, with the published data showing a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lists the prevention of multi-residential disease agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these agents as among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion on the case of the XXII District Police Captain who caused the fatal accident is complete.
It is possible that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned, was driving under the influence of alcohol or intoxicants, the spokesman for the state attorney general's office in the capital city, Attila Morvai, informed on Friday after an expert assessment of the case was completed.
The expert assessment confirmed the results of the initial investigation, which already found that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII District Police Department hit his own car on Tuesday in Lajos Kossutha Street in XXII District as a 55-year-old man was pulling over from the road ahead of him as he crossed the highway outside the designated crossing.
(After the fact that the pedestrian was passing outside the road, which is not mitigating under the rules of the road, the detouring car must still take precedence.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
The district police chief resigned as a result of these events and requested a retirement, police said, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the outset.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks totalling EUR 400 million for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a framework of EUR 300 million for the budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects carried out with the support of the Cohesion Fund in Hungary, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the agreement now signed covering the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The budgetary financing of education-related projects is also provided by a loan agreement of EUR 150 million.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that after negotiating the details of the subway financing with the EU, Hungary would return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
This could happen, according to János Veres, in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-month waiting period and no commitments shall be subject to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the realm of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to the once somewhat neglected Balkan country.
Where and who are buying the EU's ever-cheaper but fastest-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after destination for Eastern European real estate is undoubtedly Bulgaria now, with its cheap skiing apartments and seaside houses.
The most popular of these are the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša regions, Albena, Gold Sands, Sunshine Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balcik.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract investors and more and more buyers will also shop around the slums of the cheap city of Rus.
The capital Sofia is also a promise of attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space promising the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf destinations, becoming a popular destination for travel in the next two seasons, alongside the summer and winter seasons.
Foreseeable investors are already buying at a large market, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most customers are from England, but there are also customers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
The foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The newcomers buy either renovated properties worth 50 to 100 thousand euros or decayed old houses worth 5 to 15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They demand good accessibility and communication, and they are interested in being close to a big city, shopping malls and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is the chat customers (Bulgaria was ranked among the top 10 German recreational destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who shop in the hope of a medium or long-term appreciation.
Real estate prices in the capital are continuous as demand grows stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21% a year over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly outweighs wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to Minister for Environment and Water, Gabor Fodor, the expert meeting will be closed on Tuesday and the post-2012 International Climate Conference will continue with ministerial meetings after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are working on a Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
There is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States also announced that it does not now wish to negotiate exact figures, although it is committed to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The next big question of the conference is whether the developed countries will join in reducing emissions by providing both material and technological assistance to the countries that rely on it.
The agreement also provided for subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund established by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member Governing Council, most likely within the framework of the UN World Environment Programme (WEP) - as we read in Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Hungary's Minister for Environment and Water, Gabor Fodor, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in the global climate protection effort and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the 'post-2012 agreement', and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30% if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept the responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their capabilities.
Mr Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set a target of a reduction of 5.2%, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to an 8% reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country is fulfilling.
The issue is a lot for Bali, as an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be postponed until 2012 with certainty. In that case, the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately impose a new emission reduction system, the need of which was also highlighted in its latest report by the UN International Panel on Climate Change, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning IPCC.
This would delay emissions reductions and inevitably raise Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units are posting videos of their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video sharing server, popularizing themselves.
YouTube was first popularised by the RAF: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are checked by the Air Force Command, which is in charge of combat operations in Kandahar area and then sent to London where they are transmitted over the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
In this format, 139 recordings of British Air Force personnel have been uploaded to the Internet and their "channel" has been viewed by over 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered itself as a "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes recordings from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos based on their original intent for recruitment and the Department of Defense says they're good at informing the general public about the real purpose of the military's presence abroad.
"Progress in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads", said BBC defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily carries a political message, as it specifically confirms the legitimacy of government-decided military action".
The Americans have made a play
The military is concerned that amateur videos, including the deaths of soldiers, are being uploaded to the server, in addition to carefully edited, censored videos. The officers are mostly talking about casualties in some hypocritical, "official" promotional films, but not the bloody form of the battle.
And there's been a lot of video on the Internet of the Iraq and Afghanistan war that was created during the intense deployment, but the British military has only just come to them.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently -- with a shoot game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
There will be Christmas with the bow and arrow in the ministries
Labour Minister Monica Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she is holding a final working meeting for her colleagues to say goodbye to 2007 with pagans and coffee.
In some ministries, celebrations will be held with live music, while in others, officials will be served a Christmas treat and a drink.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
The government is preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year is being organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it's not expected to be attended by its employees.
On orphan Christmas, children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, and on Mission Christmas, they host family members of soldiers currently serving overseas missions, but they also host a reception for journalists.
The resort is devoting $25 million to the end-of-year atmosphere.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are out of the loop compared to the other resorts.
The GKM party is being held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and about 350 guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the Ministry.
The resort will celebrate Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Council of Justice (OIT) - the programme included concerts and dinners.
The rent of the hall was for a million forints, the rest being spent on more than 400 guests.
One of the NFÜ departments appears to be invited to another Christmas celebration: it is organised by the company that runs the tents, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), with EU funds.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház.
MAG a.s. did not confirm this information as we were unable to reach the person concerned.
No need for a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which hosted the St. Lucia Ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
However, the ILO did not ask for money from him to use its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party started with the Minister of Health, after dinner, we could dance to live music.
According to the answer to the question on the portal [origo], evening dresses or costumes were not required at all.
The Puritan feast is being organized by health, labor and local government departments.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a 400,000 forint programme and celebration for employees in its own building.
Labour Minister Monica Lamperth's colleagues are not even officially at the Christmas party, but at the closing working meeting.
According to the press release, there are 180 guests who will only get coffee and soda, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organising a Christmas meeting, which is expected to attract 436 workers, in its own large hall.
He spends 2 500 forints per guest for the Christmas party - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since the time of János Veres, PM workers have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will be lacking, however, and the officialness will be enhanced not only by the ministerial address but also by the afternoon time.
The farmhouse is having a New Year's reception on January 20th, there's no minister's Christmas.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvar Palace in Sade Municipality and according to the Ministry, 1,000 forints per person is allocated for 100 guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a brief greeting to the minister and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not host Christmas parties at all, the relevant press department told [origo].
The price of the environmental department's Christmas celebrations has not been disclosed by the press.
In any case, 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Art and Industry.
He's heading for a giant strike.
The League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Trade Unions (NTU) will set up their strike committee on Friday to coordinate the unlimited strike on Monday.
A public protest rally is being held on Saturday, and a halt to work will be held on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Bill.
The action will certainly cause serious traffic interruptions, as rail transport will almost completely stop and the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike by 13:00.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Trade Unions will announce the details of the jointly organised strike on Monday.
A strike committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday's action.
A public protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday onwards, unions joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
That means there was no deadline for the strike, which starts on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted down, the strike committees shall meet and decide on the next procedure.
The agenda for the Monday meeting of Parliament also suggests that the Health Insurance Bill may not be voted on until late at night or even at night.
The strike, which starts on Monday, will result in serious traffic interruptions: the railway will be suspended indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán's companies may be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half the lane will be closed.
The call for the strike was joined by numerous unions and civil society organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organisations have announced an indefinite strike, others have declared temporary stoppages.
As of Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (HST) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (UNOWT) have not been able to agree on sufficient services, and more and more people are travelling by rail as the Christmas holidays begin.
According to the announcements so far, a strike will be held at BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., a four-hour strike organised by the LIGA Energy Workers' Trade Unions, and a 2-hour or 2-8 hour stoppage called for by the Pedagogue Trade Union and the Democratic Pedagogue Trade Union.
The Hungarian Medical Union will be on strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (FTU), is holding a two-hour strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the Liga is that the government revoke the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept to public debate.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculating pensions be introduced gradually from the following year.
Third, to ensure that early retirement in the relevant occupations can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (UNFW), which is part of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for railway branches and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased risk to the country
The Hungarian Guard's activity, established with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of the Institute for Political Capital.
The company's 'risk warning' states that the biggest political risk in the Hungarian Guard's activities is that 'the intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary could lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term.'
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be aimed at provoking such action, adds the research institute.
He writes that one of the biggest negligence of Hungarian politicians can be explained by the fact that "public discussion of the Roma issue has been left by the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups who could build political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
This deepened the problem, preventing normal dialogue, strengthening extremists and increasing the likelihood of violent conflict, the institute said.
Moreover, the work of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, has "substantially undermined Hungary's image abroad, especially as regards its belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has been gaining increasing publicity and enthusiasm since autumn 2006, is the creation of several organisations in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which call themselves 'National Home Defence' associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly declaring the willingness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, attacks on the homeland, disruption of order), in addition to pointing to the inability of the police, the army, or the state", he adds.
He further notes that all this is done in a way that seeks to enclose various political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties in civil dress.
The emphasis on citizenship and the form of the association in the case of such groups is therefore not only a means of avoiding legal constraints on judicial registration but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited by several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, and the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries have been appealing to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All this could affect the political stability of the region", he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
The Hungarian National Guard is similar to the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The Bulgarian Guard was created in the wake of the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia's districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used that to set up a guard with the goal of the organization being "national defense".
She said that in the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced "gypsy terror", but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
He further writes that the increased risk of ethnic clashes is signalled by announcements by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard in a sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own national defence, as can be seen in the Risk Warning prepared by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of the Institute for Political Capital, said: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find anything that could affect a change in risk, they inform the public, such as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
♪ Christmas is not free ♪
In Hungary, the days of leave are strictly defined by law, and it has become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which will make it less likely for us next year.
There is no uniformity in the European Union and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working rest days.
Workdays are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is a working holiday - the New Year so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
We have a total of 11 vacations during the year.
The national holiday is March 15 to celebrate the revolution of 1848 and October 23, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1, Labor Day, November 1 and 2, we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two days of Easter, Christmas and Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays are rarely on the weekend, it has become a practice to shift the working day to one day before or after a holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we stay at work and school the previous Saturday.
The day immediately preceding or following the holiday is the day we work out, which has been regulated for years by the Minister of Labour in a special decree.
The legislation shall apply to all employers and employees employed by them, public servants and public servants alike.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in continuous operation or, in the light of their designation, operate even on working days.
This year, the work schedule will change only around the end of the year holidays: life in the country will almost cease from 24 December, as most people experience working or taking advantage of their savings in the days between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Next year, we'll have a few holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there'll be fewer shiftwork than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be changed around Labor Day so that workers can stay home for four days afterwards.
Saturday 26 April shall be a working day, so that Friday 2 May may be a day of rest.
Another shift is related to the 23rd of October holiday: Saturday 18th of October will be working instead of Friday 24th.
But the end of next year will be a holiday, because from December 24th, they will have almost all nonstop holidays, even though New Year's Day seems to be on Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can do to piss off your colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies we almost never notice: all of this is "spoiling" the day-to-day at work.
The question is, if you get used to these minor inconveniences or if you wear gloves and avoid ambiguous situations that may anger others, you will deliberately avoid them.
The tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were wanted by the marketing department", your colleague will tell you.
That's why you missed the meeting?
At best, he regrets and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (that's a less common solution).
Most of the time, an apology is the only way to solve a problem.
Before making embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about what you can do to make your colleagues uncomfortable and to deliberately try to avoid it.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than being stretched out for a piece of paper, an office thing, or your phone, and they're not there.
Remember you put a seamstress on your table yesterday, but she's gone by morning?
Or did you find a pen on the table of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without their permission, or they'll be rightly angry at you for clutching their stuff.
Do not carry envelopes or paper stickers from your office, because they can be uncomfortable if you run out of them prematurely and you will need them immediately.
The gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors from spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not put your private life of colleagues on everyone's nose!
If one of them shares his innermost secret with you, do not abuse his trust!
Keep what you have heard secret, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his things.
You're reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence because you are not feeling well or you think you would rather rest today, think that your work, your urgent tasks and your deadline work, will have to be done by someone else.
Be careful of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be at work the next day or that something may happen that will force you to stay home, notify your colleagues and supervisors that you are not there until the next day.
The same as the one in the first paragraph.
Have you ever been in a job that's been grossly ripped off by a colleague's laughing stock?
You accidentally witnessed a phone conversation that you'd rather not hear?
Do not interrupt your coworkers by clapping, singing, loud talking (over your head), or clapping, constant groaning, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they're not actually involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
You blame the others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't rely on the chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
If you've made a mistake and someone paid for it, admit it and make up for it!
Ask how you can fix things, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office too much?
Heaters and shoes: comfortable clothes for home, but not for the office!
Do not wear clothing for leisure, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming into the office in your usual clothes - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When you want to fit in, you're no longer interesting.
A late morning rush.
The radio will sound a strange melody: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding a little bit of volume.
The music changes pace and the bass is added to the previous tone coloring, then the female choir joins as a real gem.
The station mr2 plays a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
It's been a long time since our musical life has been softened by high-quality electronic pop.
But suddenly, the clog looks quite different because you're listening to Zagar's new album.
The advent of Yonderboy, a couple of new and interesting products coming from the home digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and while garage rock is back in fashion with its guitar beat, home electropop proves there's something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Five-Band and he also played in Yonderboy's band until he finally - perhaps because two dudes don't get together - went his own way.
However, his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, began to flourish only when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The film "The Season" by Ferenc Török.
His band, which started out playing in smaller clubs, gained wider exposure after wan2 magazine ranked their 2002 debut album among the top 50 most important home records and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as the only home development agency that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are definitely on track, although of course no one asked them if they were happy with this label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
Their new album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title itself seeks to create a continuity with the early flights to Friday.
It's a verse from the old Balázs Zsuzsaer band.
The reference to ethereal, flying would be in place, but alongside the ethereal spirit of this music, there is now a more vocal guitar, a rock and roll influence, in keeping with the spirit, the trend of the times.
The album was premiered at Millenáris Park by György Ligeti, who is currently working in England with The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music from morning to evening, we started playing the melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So, is everything okay?
The portal of the G.G.H. confessed to Balázs Zsuzser.
In the context of this new hit, the question is, how long does what you play stay on the edge?
The definition of fringe music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different kinds of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can just be created for sales, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
This spirit also operates in the attitude that is adopted, regardless of language or state boundaries.
Q: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B.S.: Overseas, especially from our country in the West, light music has a larger tradition.
Not only are teenagers and people in their 20s going to the concerts, but older people too.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music that are happening around them because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how much of your music is being listened to?
B.S.: Of course, it feels good to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more pronounced in concerts where the influence of the audience is already working, but it is only hidden in the unfathomable changes of the moment.
Yet I have noticed that when you want to please an audience, you cease to be interesting.
How far are you going to follow Yonderboy's example?
He's a solo artist and he's built his career more west than we are.
B.S.: We're not really following his path, regardless of how they try to explain our music sometimes.
We're more like team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first, of course, we couldn't avoid being compared to Yonderboy's work, because some of us broke away from his band and went down a different path.
In the heats of mr2 Petőfi, Wings of Love got to number one.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open yourself up to wider layers?
BZ: We weren't planning on writing a hit record to sell the record.
There's more to the song.
We intended it as the album's final cut, trying to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
How did you pick those six singers?
Why is it - what was the basic principle?
BZ: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of putting together this home-grown, vocal soloist choir.
So this six-piece band came together -- Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfa, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -- which we then renamed to Underground Scene.
Is this the song you intended, or did the girls make something out of it?
B.S.: The song has been around for a long time in the instrumental version, and when the material came out on the record, we thought we'd need something more for this song.
The chord progression led to a singing party.
That night I sang a song to him that the girls later learned.
It all came out almost for the first time and it was so spontaneous.
I remember how it came to life, but of course, it took the Wild Ones.
It wouldn't work that energetically with my voice.
On the record and at the concert, it seemed like there were girls in the background.
They don't have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, they sing together, and they're no louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also standing in the back of the stage.
Did you do it on purpose?
BZ: The fact that they were standing in the back was just because of technical issues.
The fact that we didn't want to split up the solo roles is deliberate.
And that song is about letting go of our egos, where we come from, where we belong, and just letting those wings, the wings of love, lift up.
I wish that this euphoria that we felt when the song was born could be felt by others.
Which one was the most worked with?
B.S.: In the course of composing music, not even with one, the heavier pieces were more like mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to be a groove for a long time, then everything pretty slowly found its place like a puzzle.
Which song from the new album is your favorite?
BZ: That's still changing with the concert and the fact that I've already released the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions from undervalues
A very good fraud.
That is what French banking giant Société Générale, owner of a local Commercial Bank, calls its cheerful employee Jerome Kervile.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to level with his teammates and certainly not unfit.
Unlike all major banking houses, he was aware of the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market prematurely.
"He is mentally weaker", sounded from the mouths of his superiors who sent the police to him.
But as Kerviel's statement, reported by French media outlets, such as Le Monde, shows, he was the man who made a profit of 1.6 billion euros in sales at the end of last year.
The Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he said in a statement.
In the summer, he made half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He had the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, offered to low-income clients or those who have had trouble paying back in the past, will be in trouble.
But the crisis was not meant to affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet right.
By the end of the year, his profit had climbed to €1.6 billion.
"I didn't know how to announce it when I made my first half a billion", admits Kerviel, adding that he had absolutely nothing left to keep.
He admits during the interview that he faked the records so he wouldn't get caught.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange was beginning to take an interest in his business.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come after him?
I guess not.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Where did he get the willingness to take so many risks?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 right after studying at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and in 2005, he became a freelance broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as others.
"I knew they were watching me when I first interviewed them in 2005.
"Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel explained to investigators.
But soon after he took the helm, his first big success came.
Allianz made a profit on the stock market, because it bet half a billion euros on the loss of the title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism -- he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew everything, or rather, they guessed.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes".
But then came the wound earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to starve it after the weekend in mid-January.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect on his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who has no license is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look at his records", concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with the European Commission yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner) over the next few years.
This represents approximately half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go to the regions from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transportation.
The transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds the Czech Republic can receive from the Funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year with a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and firms to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should be financed for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries to date in drawing money from EU funds.
20 years in prison for former Nicaraguan president confirmed by court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemann, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived in a house in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to his chains is unclear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials to decide whether to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, a court proved to Alemán that he regularly transferred government money to foreign corporate accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money then ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
It's the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and passed by a coalition majority without opposition support.
This year, it was passed with the support of the CZSSD last year, because it was prepared by the Minister of Sobotka and the CZSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the hectic debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally overlooked, though most influential, law quietly.
It's a paradox of some sort.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
He's more media-grateful, and that's why he gets a lot more media attention.
Politicians' guesses are more interesting to the public than rigid numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments have suffered three shortcomings that the 2008 budget is unable to solve all at once:
The first is the high proportion of mandatory expenditure, which is not only pensions but also social benefits, which was approved by the silent "coalition" of the CFSP and the CFSP last year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the failure of the first.
The third threshold is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
But the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to obtain additional investment resources in addition to tax, fees, and bank loans, often issued bonds without their heads, which they used to indebt their city halls disproportionately.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts by selling shares in energy and other distribution networks they have received from the state through privatisation.
They don't have that source anymore.
If we just stick to the official and verifiable facts, we'll find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years now, which is what the CZSD is always boasting about.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to get public finances in order.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed far more wisely than our republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
So there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have grown quite unnecessarily to gigantic proportions in recent years.
While some of the nonsensical populist spending that was approved this year before the election was cancelled, unless the retirement threshold is moved and the pension reform is implemented soon, then any policy in this country will effectively end and whoever is in power will be just a government.
It's a small exaggeration to say that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the bulk of tax money into pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot therefore be revolutionary, but can only suspend the suppression of normal spending by mandatory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely useless if past governments had not managed to do what they could over the last decade.
If we don't want to make the politicians in power just officials, then we have to be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government, which knows that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, the peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow a balanced state budget to be achieved gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
It's going to get more than $100 billion in auctions on the stock market.
In these auctions, banks charge the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction 40 billion dollars, and then make another 24 available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual countries have agreed on such a coordinated approach to preventing or mitigating the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest problems facing the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend", Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group advisory firm wrote in his report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more to go.
"Central banks must be really worried about what might follow if they chose this approach", said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will lend to their customers.
That would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks have made this decision after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, even though central banks in the US, Canada and the UK had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another rate cut", said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting, a Reuters news agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank's move will help to fuel the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, which is the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The ecologists' debates are incredible.
Global climate change is expected to hit developing countries the hardest.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now been leveled at the closing UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, when he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said that the ecological debate is incredible.
Clause said that the unacceptable is not only the structure of the conference, which is made up of a strange mix of government and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are a substitute for solving current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President, at the presentation of his book, stressed that the subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book was also available in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my views".
Now, then, interested ones can read his unadulterated views.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climate scientist, he believes he has enough preconceptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional papers, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
In the book's main conclusions, he points out that climate change is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious and therefore not a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are futile, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those present that he was not against 'reasonable environmental protection but against militant environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between cost and benefit'.
Klaus was speaking on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't change 600,000 people.
600,000 drivers have missed the deadline and failed to exchange their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for a change so the authorities can still issue a new ID by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not worried that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road without a valid driver's license.
Officials say the license was not changed by those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in a driver's license exchange, the city's authorities are overwhelmed with requests and interest in a license exchange has risen this week.
The Magistrate's office caters to about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about a half hour of waiting in lines.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driver's licenses.
It takes 20 days to issue a new ID.
However, it is possible to request an extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to pass the mandatory change of licence at the end of the year and leave the road without a valid driver's license will face fines from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But a cop can also deal with the offence through a plea bargain.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is increased to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the mayor could have fined a man who didn't go anywhere.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum fine of 1,000 crowns.
But according to the transport ministry spokesman Karl Hanzelka, the 10,000 fines are not a threat to anyone.
He says a driver's license is a document that people can use to decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a valid passport that everyone needs to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take it or to send it by registered mail to the competent municipal office.
The licence issued between 1964 and 1993 will be suspended at the end of the year.
However, motorists must gradually change other types of driver's licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to switch.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentences for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konaryek, accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague Supreme Court decided that the sentence was reduced to one year and two years.
It was originally a threat to the Prague Organized Crime Investigation Board for 14 and 12 years.
The decision today cannot be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is awaiting a verdict of first instance.
In other cases, however, he has already received sentences of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
The county court in January found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, and today the Supreme Court heard an appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying they're a fabricated case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among others, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang was giving 30 percent to Opava and Konyarik for that.
The charges relate to gang crimes from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, which often have seriously damaged the health of victims, but also the abuse of public authority and the illegal use of arms.
During house searches, police discovered illegal guns, steel-powered bullets, a laser target, or a self-propelled gun.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the nearly 20 men involved in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still testifying in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to trial.
The main character has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půtová and Maroš Šulejová, who are currently in Irish custody, awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Child support account: 12 million
For the role of children in the maternity ward, the lawyer for the injured families Igor Veleb wants the hospital in Tbilisi to pay him 12 million crowns in damages, plus court costs.
For every mother of three million, for every father of two million, and for every child of one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's lawyer, Ondrej Dostal, therefore, disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very, very high", he said after today's meeting.
'But in order to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion which the counterparty has asked to draw up.
We'll see if it has any confessional value.
We remain convinced that it will be in the statistical for all", Dostoil stressed.
He estimates the amount to be between $100,000 and $200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of the apple wanted a million crowns for every month she didn't raise her biological daughter.
Veleb was the subject of a compensatory expert opinion prepared by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motl.
Parents of children have suffered psychological harm and stress to varying degrees and depths, according to psychologists and psychiatrists.
Men were better at coping with stress, even though they had to complain that they had not prevented the miscarriage of newborns.
Women are also more vulnerable to the current trauma and what's happening right now, Veleb summed up.
Veronica and Nicole were replaced by nurses at the Tbilisi maternity ward on December 9th last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermakov in Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojanska to the Apple.
Hejtman His Highness Miloš Vystrčil handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the district is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach out to the reserve fund, and exceptionally they may request the assistance of the founder.
So far, the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, the amounts counted according to tables in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup lost the Wallachian kingdom
The bottle of wine lost the dispute over the Wallachian Kingdom's trademark.
According to a judge of the Ostrava District Court, the name was first used by the Wallachian king, but the project was built by a long-term team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Soap didn't attend the meeting today.
But according to his lawyer, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolk Polívka", Polívk's lawyer said after the trial.
He thinks everyone in the Kingdom of Wallachia will remember the actor and comedian.
Harabiš feels the same way.
"We've been working on it for almost a decade.
Gathering money and inventing actions", he said.
He thinks money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could have a positive impact.
They want to parasitize our work", he added.
The business of profit
According to the court's description, the Wallachian king first used the Pollywans in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohachty.
But back then, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the Wallachian passports.
The initial recession resulted in the creation of trade and lucrative business activities, which Harabiš then continued with the establishment of the Kingdom of Valais.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to have his name and signature on the passports and even offered discounts to their holders when visiting his farm and theater shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polívka published in the management for his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka's Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped", the judge said.
But she added that Harabiš and his team, who were intensely dedicated to the project, were the heart of the project.
The cooperation of the now defunct parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organised a formal coronation for Polívka in Vsetina.
Since then, however, disputes have built up between Pollyva and Harabisch, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I, the one elected for life".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by singer Jarmila Shulaka as the queen mother at Harabis's urging.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clearly, it could bring Karabisch's willingness to abdicate the throne and half the princess into dispute.
He should be a new king.
He hasn't given details or a deadline yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like the King's Ride in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Soap can apply for it too", added Harabiš.
The test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing bias
To be honest, I've never owned a Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not very good, the quality of the layout, the handling and the production could be considered as sub-average.
But there's a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market now, and it's much better.
And the van called SW is a little further up and I don't have much time to think.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the head space in the back seats, for example.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the body of the van means that even the two-meter-long ones won't suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the interior very quickly so I don't overdo it.
It's a pretty well-designed design, where the only complaint I have is the poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or cushions.
The side-wheel drive also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space, there's also a feeling of increasing body size.
Then the aforementioned lack of space over the head disappears in the van.
Bags in the trunk
So the main character in this car is his luggage man.
I must assess it as very accessible (including the back window) and as a decent storage facility.
Deaf areas are fitted with restraint tyres, which is the ideal compromise.
It's not overpowering, it can be stretched, and it can hold even heavier objects.
But let's stop together on volume.
The table shows that the basic arrangement is 428 liters, which is more of a competitive average.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Fabia Combi Damage.
Comparing 207 SW to a new generation of the Juvenile product, we find that Peugeot is far behind by a significant 52 liters.
This is a critical value for a holiday abroad or for loading a stroller.
But if I'm going to pick up the positive, I still have to mention the floor is completely straight after the second row of supports are folded or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 88 kW.
And to be honest, this is what a 16-year-old girl who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It's quiet, low-powered, and mostly drawn.
If I compare it to a harmful period that always seems like it has a stuffed cloth to drain, I can only be excited about it.
The price will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a car with a fourteen-wheel drive is still going up.
Our unit costs $410,900, which is pretty much enough.
The Premium equipment tested will then add another CZK 80,000 to the equipment.
But we still had the head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic airlocking, electric control of the rear windows...
It's just that the car costs $1,500.
It's a lot, but if you count the extra equipment at Fabie's, you'll get a very similar number.
So all we have to do is decide on the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There are more children from Eastern Europe in British schools, raising concerns among local residents about further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has thus far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even report cases of violence escalating between immigrants and children of indigenous peoples.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
The quarrels, bullying, and quarrels among students have also spread to the parent-child relationship.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by saying that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police must have intervened after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
Girls were supposed to honor a man with racist remarks and throw stones at him.
"As we were walking home, a boy got up at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he bent over us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass", another unpleasant incident for The Times was described by the mother of the Slovak students.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local settler even called the dispute with Eastern European immigrants a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who have come here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It's truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and booze on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you'll find it in a complete and even richer list.
But there's only one island you'll find much more of, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a transshipment point for treasure that the Spanish in America had looted and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the American mafia bosses Lucky Luciano because everything that was a crime in the US (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were Mr.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, and Frank Sinatra, and all that.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, and cars rode along the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and owned his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, they left their signatures of the stars of show business and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, they make you a cocktail at your own request.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s still drive through Havana because the once imported seals and fiat in that salty, wet air have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is largely decaying, there are no more beautiful colonial monuments in the vicinity than there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but especially in Varadero, off the coast of Holguin province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another treat that is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by trainers.
One third of the extensive plantations were tied to sugar mills by narrow-gauge steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renovated for many decades, and there are functioning machines whose counterparts are now only in museums elsewhere.
Where to go?
The most famous places in Cuba are not forgotten by most visitors.
So Varadero or Havana doesn't need to be over-written.
Let me just say that the museum is in the aforementioned Hemingway's home, and whoever loves this writer should not miss a visit.
The Vinyl Valley One of the most picturesque parts of Cuba is the Vinyl Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone soil.
The maggot, limestone, and rock rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and the fertile soil is trapped in their cavities, making even the windy cliffs covered by dense growth.
The valley is the place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see the final shape of it if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
You might even find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean production was filmed there.
The following is the list of the countries of the European Union:
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and sugar trade brought him fame and fortune.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has remained almost unchanged for four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that until the 1950's, there was no road to connect the area to the rest of the country.
She's the one who helped him stay away from the outside world.
Nothing was fixed there, and that's why nothing was fought, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth visiting the nearby attractions, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugarloaf.
In the evening, we must go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is silent over the morning.
Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of goods
A town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
That's certainly the way the road is.
The two roads leading from Guantanamo must cross high, rugged mountains and through nature, almost unnoticed by human activity.
The eastern island of Cuba has been inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site because of its pristine nature.
They make the best chocolate there, the church has the Columbus Cross (actually created about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage), and from the hill where the former castle and the present-day El Castillo Hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, santeria, the African religions of the descendants of former slaves, all these things could be described in many pages.
But, as they say, it's better to see it once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say.
The United States says the lack of troops and the lack of equipment is affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming summers.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, representatives of countries with troops in the south agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies today.
While the United States this week through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called for more action by NATO forces, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid as a priority.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start further economic and security development themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
90%
The U.S. military's latest data shows the Afghan insurgents' activity is at its highest level in five years.
Violence increased by 27 percent from last year, and in Helmand province, in the south, by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
But the United States says the Allies have reached the very limit in their organization and equipment.
Specifically, they're asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan forces.
"We're going to have to think seriously about specific future goals and how to achieve them", Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, which is not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries involved have also been in dispute in recent months over whether all Allies are making maximum spending in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans have a fairly large presence in Afghanistan.
But they're deployed in areas where there's minimal violence and the war demands on them aren't as high as we are in the south and east of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan thugs exposed: Germans playing while our boys fight", Sun wrote in the footage, which included footage of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit playing rugby in southern Afghanistan.
The government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a national debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget management.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, this has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
But since June, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
So the Treasury today confirmed its government debt data from early October.
Every Czech has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
In the entire past year, the state has incurred more than 111 billion crowns of debt.
"So far, it seems that with the lower deficit next year, we could only cross the TCN limit in 2009.
The debt should be between 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns next year", Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora says: "We could reach a trillion-plus mark in 2009.
Exactly when will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the political scene turns out to be changing, if politicians are willing to save more, it could be moved to 2010.
But I don't anticipate that change", he said.
Debts Growing
The government debt is the central government debt and is primarily created by the accumulation of government deficits.
The public debt is financed by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year.
The so-called marketable public debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the public debt has increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot to show how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by bonds, where there is a 20 percent increase.
It's bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows what he'll be dealing with when the pension reform comes along", Pikora said.
Better than I thought
The 2007 State debt financing and management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159,2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget management.
The figure is mainly the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach CZK 76 billion this year from the projected CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13,3 billion, a pension reserve of CZK 10 billion, financing of CZK 43 billion in government bonds and repayments of CZK 1,8 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank.
A woman is due to appear in court in Chartum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Chartum on Thursday evening and deported, her lawyer said.
A British woman was accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear Muhammad despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was punished by being wounded with a whip.
The British teacher, aged 45, who works at Unity High School in Chartum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classroom teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hasan, Abdullah, and Mohamed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
After a vote in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children eventually choose the name Mohamed as their favorite.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is a very common baptismal name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of the bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohammed".
The bear himself did not have a label with this name on it, but the problem is that the very depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of her fellow Muslims, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and that she would never do anything that would be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name", which he said was only an "innocent mistake".
Many of her teachers share this view, describing her as "very careful with her students", adding that "she never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohammed is also the second most common surname in the UK, spelled in fourteen different ways in English.
This baptismal name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of that baptismal name?
For example, is it possible to give them toys?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations on Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Failure in the end.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanians concluded the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming differences in views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the status", European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His US counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations were over.
"We do not expect violence anytime soon, but we are entering a difficult period", he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense".
Negotiations conclude on 10 December
The EU, the US and Russia's troika negotiators will leave for Kosovo on Monday for the last time.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population speaks Albanian, could be seen in a clearer light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN in August this year entrusted the Troika with new negotiations.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated, compromise solution", Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community rule, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that, if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on expanded autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement", Kosovo's self-government president Fatmir Seydi said at the Badensk hotel, where the "last chance negotiations" were taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future premier of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "is not a past that has led to murder and deportation".
'Dominated effect'
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that a compromise is still in the pipeline and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domestic effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia, that doesn't mean compromise is impossible", he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say"
"For Serbia, the only acceptable solution is a solution from the Security Council", said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end the way it started: on the Security Council grounds".
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be given by the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be done "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has reached a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his urging, US President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately open negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-long dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them reach a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides that come from the "roadmap" to the peace they agreed in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the talks between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority aim to "conclose a peace treaty that would resolve all unresolved issues without exception, including central ones".
This declaration includes three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the territory of the modern state of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Abbas took the words of the US president and stressed that the next meeting should be "comprehensive and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution should be addressed, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert then took the stage, stating that the next negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it should be decided that it should be concluded by 2008".
Bush has designated the end of 2008 as the deadline for his "two-state vision", Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has accepted a commitment to this effect from Bush even before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with an Arabic-language newspaper in the Saudi capital.
The prosecutor's office says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the black column, the official version does not agree with what is being said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the inspection of the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car passed on Sunday shortly after 17h on the rue Louise-Michel in the commune of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on patrol and was travelling at 40 to 50 km/h without the side lights on", explains the police source.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore not authorized to use public transportation" (see below), driven by two unprotected youths, was travelling "at very high speeds".
"The motorcycle hit the police car from the left after failing to take the right", one police officer explained.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle's crew was negative.
The condition of the vehicle (broken front, shattered windscreen, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, reacted very quickly and announced earlier yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "accidents of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger" under the direction of the départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (the regional police department of the Val d'Oise department).
At the press conference this afternoon, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation excludes, at this stage, the police's responsibility for the accident.
Three witnesses who were interrogated on Sunday evening confirmed "the police version that the minor had approached them fairly quickly on the left", according to the official.
Some kind of line, undoubtedly caused by the clipping of the cliffs into the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained trapped until the police car could stop.
The vehicles have been secured and are undergoing technical expertise.
Both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rapid spread of rumors among the people that police officers should leave the scene quickly without providing first aid to two young men.
The IGPN was also to rule out, with all due care, 'any serious offence' in this respect.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation that requires more research and that requires great caution", the police source said.
The Liberation Journal met with an eyewitness of the moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to the scene of the accident.
"My cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, and I immediately ran down to try to resuscitate them", relates the Witness.
There was nothing we could do".
Then he saw a "going, scared cop.
Two others tried to resuscitate one of the young men, and the fourth was on the phone".
Faced with rapidly increasing tensions and the certainty of the young people's hopeless situation, the police were driven by a car of colleagues who had arrived on the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also gave a heart massage, but to no avail.
"Let no one say that the police have not helped the youth.
These young people were given first aid.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions in Pakistan Rise
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In Lahore, in the east of the country, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the emergency measures were injured by tear gas shells, which witnesses said used law enforcement.
The last of the men responded with stones, wounding several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been called.
Similar scenarios to those in Karachi and Rawalpindi where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
A few were supposed to be called.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in the wave of arrests of about 500 opponents, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
The high court entrance was fenced off Monday morning to prevent a gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the law movement gained support from religious parties grouped into the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "has urged the population to send flowers to judges who oppose the state of emergency and garbage to those who have taken an oath before the Musharraf".
"The promise of the Musharraf is not valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is the direct target of an emergency declared on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was due to speak about the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in an indirect presidential election held on October 6.
The President of the Iftikhar Court, Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's rulings", the official told The News.
The promise of Parvize Musharraf to relinquish the military and become a civilian president will not "validate" after the state of emergency is imposed, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniforms by November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also dismissed the ongoing speculation that the deputy chief of the army should order President Musharraf to be placed under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies still result from unexpected pregnancies
This figure includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unlikely today, according to a study conducted by the French National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the enactment of the Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This figure includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The legalization of contraception has only made it possible to improve "fertility control", the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight of every ten births today are well-planned.
One in five couples even has a birth calculated to be exactly one month and, if possible, springtime, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for a child to be born.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work required astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to remarkably repair the torn solar panel necessary for the station's continued scientific activity.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records for duration, distance from the manned modules, speed at which it was planned, and the amount of "clutter" astronauts spent repairing it.
The problems arose on Tuesday as astronauts aboard the Discovery landed the Harmony module, a large warfare unit designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see the frame).
This module is a kind of landing mole for lab modules.
But you need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17 1/2 ton module producing electricity using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor at its final stand.
After moving it, the crew began to dismantle the module's 70-meter solar panels.
And in that case, one of the panels, which was disassembled as a pulling harmonic, was damaged by a cable slit in an area of almost a meter.
The decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to perform a control exit on the Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was broken, were forced to work on the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, attached to the station arm, and perform repairs.
He's one of the best spacewalkers in the U.S. Air and Space Administration.
Tall, stately, very clever, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original occupation of physician was assigned to "operate" on "damaged" solar panels.
After examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed a "wings" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by another spacewalker who stayed near the balance chamber, and also from the inside, other astronauts, including crew chief Peggy Witson.
The tools he used, a mini hockey stick with insulation to prevent electric shock to solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and made "by box" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully disassembled and then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Last afternoon, astronauts were taking a half-hour break before today, when seven astronauts will return to the Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the airline and defence company announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1,2 billion and EUR 1,4 billion to face the A400M delay.
EADS has lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21,96.
The financial group was forced to revise its projected production results for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the take-off.
The price for the delay in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was set at 'EUR 1,2 billion to 1,4 billion, of which over a billion for Airbus', the European manufacturer EADS's parent company said.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to address the situation in the Union.
The group also disclosed that the new cost estimate corresponded to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS's production results in 2006 fell by 86%, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the A380 giant.
The group initially envisaged the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday's election will be a no-brainer: Russians will vote for President Putin's party, United Russia, by a majority.
Confirming, after a very few free elections, his drive for stability and even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a televised message to voters on public television stations, but the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so from the position of leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party that is supposed to celebrate the crushing victory.
When he was welcoming foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president was not making any sense and settled for another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite campaign theme.
"We know the value of true democracy and we want the most honest, transparent and open elections possible, elections without the slightest defect in beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not that far off.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says "there have never been such dirty elections, not even under Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, is still banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have the homo soviet mentality"
In the context of these free and open elections, two far more open questions arise:
"Who will be Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
But no followers appear.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the whole line in parliamentary as well as presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality, they don't feel like they are the masters of their own destiny", believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University observes a more distant connection: civil society, in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe, was delayed; that famous common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has continued to adopt a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, not by terror but by a certain economic prosperity", believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians "voluntarily renounce personal responsibility", which they have shown briefly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why should I think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) are running local candidates for the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
The public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherdenichenko, a 45-year-old professor: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored for 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were, up to that time, only accessible for 'humanitarian' purposes, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or her legal guests.
Eleven archival governments - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open the archives to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Free access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to study "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps, and the health of forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, opposed the disclosure of these names to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disabilities of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour civilians, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are handling tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Berlin Technische Universität, in 2006.
EU and India aim to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth trading partner, according to the European Commission.
"The free trade agreement will greatly boost both economies" and "India will gain better access to the market of the 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson argued.
The Asian and European giant together trade "€47 billion in goods" and "€10 billion in services" annually, said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, this week, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India will meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President Manuel Barroso.

The Bank of England has raised concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England on Thursday indicated that it intends to alleviate current concerns about further deterioration in the credit market by announcing a £10 billion offer in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an unusually long offer.
'In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks more certainty in how to secure their cash position for the period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the holding period, which starts on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,' it said in a statement.
The Bank specifies that £10 billion (EUR14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market from 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the basic interest rate.
It appears that this is the first time that BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its communication that it 'remains ready to implement further measures to keep the interest rates' of interbank loans on a daily basis at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The quarterly interest rate was set at 6,6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fees that have deterred the banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculation, fueled by the development of the pound against the euro, many have chosen to use the European Central Bank's lower interest rates and greater discretion to place money on the financial market.
The UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the People's Movement) and the NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre clubs on Thursday refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to rejecting the text.
The text of the draft law was put on the agenda in the context of the so-called socialist 'nest' (a meeting initiated by individual parliamentary clubs) and contained a dozen measures adopted by the PS presidency on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, a transport check or the regulation of rent.
As the UMP and the NC voted against the individual paragraphs being discussed (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate which became an occasion for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the PS MPs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club would re-introduce these proposals in full as amendments to the amendment to the Finance Bill, which will be debated by Parliament next week.
A new festival is born
Following much speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is launching a new festival, this promoter/producer announced Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Republic Festival by British host Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor for our company to work with a man who has unabashedly inspired the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of Billboard.com's C3 server said.
C3 is producing the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to run from August 8 to 10 at a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most acclaimed festival organizers.
In 1989, he took over the running of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of 177,500.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever witnessed, and says his firm and Melvin Benn's are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as our marketplace, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, the current city government has made us politicised, adds Charlie Jones.
"We've been fortunate to have the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Bennem and we're about to establish a great festival in a unique location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005 after making their mark on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in urban settings.
"The European model of Melvin Benna Festival is in the countryside, while our festivals are more in the green spaces of cities", says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine the two concepts in a way that creates the impression of a rural festival in European and urban in American".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The City of Vineland, including the Mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims that 'they are favourable enough to allow for investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that will hopefully last a long time'.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will hold 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed as the program is just being published.
"While the vinyl will be rock-inspired, the music will be colorful to appeal to a wide audience", says Carlie Jones.
C3's partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last year's Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie studios to Montreal when the Terminator itself is against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to fall for the Governor?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go.
Our job is to offer the ones they think are the best", he said.
The Festival Hunt
For the moment, though, Denise Turcotta's priority is promoting local film.
The Oscars are already underway.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they're Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the goal is to showcase Quebec films, raise awareness of them, and ensure directors provide interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good publicity run a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It's going to be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will premiere at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is there a marathon at the end of the year?
There's less than five weeks until the end of the current year, and investors are already getting their hands on me expecting a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
But this year, experts aren't so sure it will happen.
The Bank considers that 'statistically, the month of December is a positive month on the stock exchange'.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in current market contexts, there is some doubt, at least in the short term.'
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the final weeks of the year, stating that 'the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest given the lack of collateral alternatives, particularly the solid income influenced by the effect of trading in high-quality securities, both in the long and short term'.
They therefore believe that the market will be more stable rather than volatile, 'primarily because the impact of the likely fall in Fed (Federal Reserve) rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures.'
Javier Barrio, the head of sales at BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to make a bold statement that a marathon is going to happen.
"There is not much reason to rejoice", assures the expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the peak values recorded on 8 November, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year by a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the reshopping of portfolios and traditional pension deposits that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year will be a little different, since he believes the marathon will be held earlier, in the second week of December, after an extended Constitution Day weekend.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "therefore we could see a reflection of the index caused by reports from the US about the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes that these results will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles to ensure that Ibex reaches new highs.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is a big headline".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Building companies will also be able to get rich at this marathon if they do.
"ACS has been re-establishing itself for several months now, and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and the FCC will follow suit", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the leading factor in the latter part of the year due to increased sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also perform very well, even if it is not well represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been the month of falls only in two cases.
The real end-of-year marathon took place in 2003, the year the stock market ended the crisis triggered by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained 28.17%, December saw a 6.68% increase.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth year in a row to be profitable (Ibex has so far increased by 8.36% since January) and if it will manage to run its marathon by the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open from Friday to Saturday at 12 noon
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These Popular Max branches are a big change for the bank.
The same applies to the other Spanish entities, as they are the first group to decide to make such a jump and to bet on a continuous opening hours of their branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group which has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening period of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, it intends to strike a deal with the unions to cancel 75% of its branches' opening hours on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening hours by 1 p.m., though not to the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive for the other actors to join or not join this initiative, which promotes opening times.
That's exactly the goal of the project that Popular Bank has set itself.
To attract individual customers to these locations for their shopping, small and medium-sized enterprises, grocery stores and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank intends to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as it is not opening new branches but merely restructuring existing ones.
The Bank will therefore modernise its branches already in the business areas by adapting them to the profile of the customers in the individual streets.
This extension of the opening hours is complemented by a different concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colours.
The Bank's commercial director Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not be a major investment but a larger recruitment of staff, as the branch will move from six to eight to nine.
The factories will even be equipped with meeting rooms for SMEs and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid's streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2 500 branches.
And another 60 immigrant-specialized companies, which operate under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax's branches will not follow the BBVA model, as many of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients", Rivera says.
They just agreed with Telephone to sell the phones through outside staff.
Telecinco has doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock exchange.
We did it.
This was the sentence expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, who expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the transaction, stating that the television he operates had doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
He said: 'What I regret is that it was not because we grew more but because we fell less.'
He stressed that the weak market had caused us to "fall less".
Telecinco closed its trading yesterday with a 2.54 percent swing.
This profit pushed their losses over the previous part of the year to 15,66%.
The market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) with Vocent's participation (another 13%), according to Bloomberg, thus amounts to EUR 4 488,88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% since January, is half worth $2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies assessed is 3,571 billion for Sogecable, 2 518,53 million for Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion for Vocento.
Vasile said the comparison with Antenna 3 offers, 'because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in tracking.'
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass the billion gross ad revenue this year, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the forecast were to be met, this TV channel would have seen an increase in advertising turnover of 3,6%, compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Net Turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1,6 % (to 734,4 million) in the first nine months of the year, while Net Revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, headed by Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the acquisition of Endemol of 33% together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50 percent, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we can satisfy our shareholders, who have already raised Endemol's value by 33%.
Analysts say the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit forecasts for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because they explain that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0,5 to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5 to 5,1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antenna 3 by 4,5 per cent in 2008 and 7,5 per cent in 2009.

Congress has approved the transposition of MiFID effective November 1
In parallel with parliamentary deliberations that ended today with a vote by Congress on novels included in the bill by the Senate, the government has held a public hearing on the regulations that develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services provider (ESIS), financial advisory company (AFI) that will connect to securities firms, securities brokerage firms and portfolio managers.
In addition, the number of systems for executing financial instruments transactions is expanded by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems to compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also obliges investment firms to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires the reporting of all transactions carried out to facilitate surveillance by the CNMV.
During the Congressional Commerce Committee's deliberations, several amendments were made, among them the one that highlights the need to consider securitised claims as a 'complex' financial instrument given the high risk to the investor, as demonstrated by what happened in the US with high-risk subprime mortgages.
The transposition of the Directive was also used to legally specify the functions that bachelors in economics and business administration can hold 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 specifying the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate also ordered the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1 per cent in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication is consistent with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in a timely and quality comparable to that achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistics Office) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily correspond to the final data to be available on 14 December this year.
'ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level'
Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November increase in the ISC to 4,1% was "a temporary figure", but also predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes specified in the Congressional ballot that "even if it is not a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential from the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", the Minister of Economy said, referring to the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years.
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to take an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits of over £25 billion, which gradually declined in two and a half months of client distrust despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity's name with its Virgin Money brand, needs to raise about a quarter of the proceeds from the UK banks in the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach its target of £30 billion.
The group of wealthy Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for its prominent advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week announced the offer of Virgin, a consortium of three other companies, as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged construction corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current Mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (Public Party) in the early hours of today for his alleged involvement in construction corruption practices that were exposed this week.
One of the city's secretaries and the local police chief was also arrested.
In May of this year, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current MP and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER, could have been the 'head' of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the city hall and the building commission and no further arrests are expected in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the prime suspect in construction corruption, was charged earlier this week.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the "human" MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the investigating sources, the subject of the investigation is Morales' alleged selection of contractors for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that has been requalified for 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, preside over the Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election and became President of the Congress if the Socialists won the general election.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place at noon today at the party's federal headquarters.
The chief executive of the former minister's office said that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and that Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this La Mancha politician will be the Socialist Party candidate for President of the Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marin as president of Congress, who announced on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career to focus on combating climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had been constantly pressuring him to return to the top politics he left two years ago.
He also said that just as the citizens know who will be the deputy minister of economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce who will be the president of the Congress in a "transparent form".
If Bono is elected, he hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect, not of slander or screaming" and aim to "become more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak peacefully and quietly is the Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted on one occasion 26 times".
He also praised the current president, Manuel Marin, for "his good work", and refused to present himself in his place so as not to be reduced to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate propaganda
As the movement against climate change is subject to ruthless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show strong solidarity.
And to have a leader of a movement who is the prime minister like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal compels him to explain why the activity or inaction of his government has contributed significantly to Spain's lead in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which businesses will be affected, which habits of the population will have to be changed, which energy savings, individual and collective, will have to be accepted and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who sacrifices themselves and who pays to save the planet.
But we have not received such explanations, and we will not.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even a penny of the petrol price, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), seemed so risky in terms of the election that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so that nothing stops, pure propaganda, passwords that have no real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the treaties with the planet; this gentleman so useful to the campaign, who neither speaks, nor accuses, nor demands anything, but is the ornament of meetings and a stimulus of tenderness.
Unless he's just a virtual contracting party and doesn't ask us to ride a bike and cool off with a hood.
Mayor and police chief of Totana were arrested on suspicion of corruption in construction
According to investigating sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, "people" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the town's secretary and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing construction crimes.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he now resides, along with a number of police officers who also appeared at the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Works and Housing Administration.
These three arrests were added to six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction so that the Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 houses there, after paying illegal commissions during the last election period.
Two other people have not been arrested but are being charged in summary proceedings in the Totana City Court of First Instance.
The first six people arrested were brought to trial today.
According to sources, the former mayor of Totana, and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate office registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of Nuaria, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province) as was Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a group through which bribes were transmitted.
The investigation is being carried out by the Crime Group in the construction of the Central Operational Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven searches, mostly at companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, a well-known poultry business owner who could have acted as a middleman.
Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would include the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was redeveloped and its project was to double the population of the municipality of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to promoting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
It happens too.
The following is the list of the Member States:
If you don't mind, we'll leave Book of the Month out and maybe we'll be attacked by other awards and competitions in the meantime.
I've got something in my head.
People, life is a change.
Of course you can come up with ideas.
2nd
Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (except at the beginning of the PISA report on world education), which refers to what the newspapers published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book criticism coincidentally appeared:
"The content of the philosophy subject has entered the public debate in connection with the tragedy at the Jokela school.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages works by Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the education councillor responsible for the philosophy subject, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic philosophy course in secondary schools".
3 of the following:
One colleague reports on the criminal offence of downloading the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a felony punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell a record in a shop for less than EUR 400, it is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you sell up to EUR 1 000 in a store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for downloading (Section 244.1)
D. It is less serious to engage in fights than in compact shifts.
The rate of participation in the riots is from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts the rate would be from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film to DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by a penalty equal to the provision of pornographic material to minors (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, someone got their hand, and it's fine.
Four.
My attending physician is putting on one of his articles about strange research called "Money Makes the Brain Activate, Especially When Others Get Less".
Or the feelings that the employees feel about their monthly salaries depend on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using MRI scans and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernt Weber, study author and leader of the group Display Neuroscience at Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The most active activity occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly".
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they got the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I don't really know if this conclusion required that much science.
The Balkan applicant
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the Hague prosecutor's office.
Her term expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, which is the name of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film Karlin Liste (2006, not shown in Spain), which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York City in the pursuit of escaped criminals and pressuring the states concerned to withdraw the network.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. is a significant expense that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
The choice of the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a model of car.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurer and the insured.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurer will receive an agreed amount of insurance for taking charge of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance price is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle being insured or use thereof, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely an accident is, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both women and people over 25 have to pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies have concluded that married people are less likely to have accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the rides, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The frequency of the rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must examine the situation carefully to choose the insurance that best suits his insurance profile.
We will show you the most important variables for choosing the type of insurance that, in addition to being suitable for the type of insured, will also be reasonably priced.
People under 25 experience disadvantages such as little driving experience and short-term driving licence when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
While all-risk insurance is ideal for good coverage, cheaper options exist.
The most prudent drivers can choose risk-free insurance at a discount to get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the insurance event payment provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price, which will be higher or lower the participation", explains Luis Noguera, CEO of First Europe in Spain, an internet insurance broker.
Another option is to extend the insurance to other operators by providing the client with insurance against damage to other persons but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of vehicle.
I'm giving you a recommendation.
If you are younger than 25, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow for future insurance reductions.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the malus is an increase in the basic rate mentioned.
"The bonus and the bonus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it would be able to afford to increase the bonus", explains Noguera.
After crossing the 25 year limit, it is easier for drivers to go to the insurance market because their risk index is reduced by experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange for all-risk discount insurance.
"Young people usually cannot use their previous experience when an accident occurs, and even when they are driving", assures the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "newcomer fear" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children, it is better to arrange for all-risk insurance, provided that his financial situation allows.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the lowest risk index client and therefore their surpluses will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk insurance with a discount of the insurance (which could amount to EUR 300) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting from the third year after the vehicle is purchased.
"They are more comfortable driving and more affordable, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount", notes Luis Noguera.
Retired persons are recommended to have full-risk insurance with a discount of insurance (which is EUR 150) or extended insurance to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident but also because it is a significant expense, which is a valid reason for properly exploring the insurance options that would be most appropriate to us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to score a point on AC Milan, which means the semi-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will match their strengths at the San Siro on Tuesday in a bid to score the missing points to reach their respective Champions League goals, as it would mean being first for Italy and the Scots would decide their place.
The Italians have 10 points and have already secured a lead in the fifth draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but they need another one to make sure they don't get overtaken by the six-pointed Shakhtar who will play Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will enter the 13th semi-final for the first time, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and an undefeated result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems most likely, even if both teams try to fight for victory, because the Italians won't want to take the field and Celtic know that after the win, they'd be first and secure a better place in the semi-finals.
Gordon Strachan's men could even lose if Shakhtar doesn't win, but they can't count on that because with the same nine points, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost 2-1 in Glasgow last week but won the first straight (2:0).
And so AC Milan will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who believe they will reach the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the previous competition by a goal Kaká in extra time (1:0) after a 0:0 lead in the first period.
The hope for the Rossoneri to win is that of Shakhtar, who has the price of victory if Celtic loses, both for promotion to the semi-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could have a third place win, so they would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver .
The Spice Girls have opened their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 people since breaking up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sportsy Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before they began their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that their reunion was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video that told the story of the band that caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour coincide with the release of their new album, which is being released in Spain by EMI, and features a selection of their major hits, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage wearing bracelets donated by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the crowd that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria forbade him a few days ago.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that she "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she'll think of the show".
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" led to the five-member group's dissolution two years later, also expressed nervousness at a press conference two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought about why not, so I'm glad I made the decision", Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other so much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So, at first, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived, the army was waiting for them at the airport.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He's going to be performing in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
The price of natural gas is currently being disputed between Russia and Ukraine, which increases the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it gets from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in the negotiations", said Anatoly Kinash, Ukraine's economy minister, to Reuters.
'The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.'
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in Gazprom's supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must check foreign workers"
The inspector said the Scottish NHS chambers must improve criminal records checks on non-European employees.
The recommendation from Chief Inspector Robert Black came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were done correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the High Authority was immediately interested in staff recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area following the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after a Jeep was hit by a door in the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court via video message accused of being involved in the attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chamber is expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK before they are employed.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the Commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with audits in several countries.
"While we have found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out on a regular basis", the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS was in many ways aligned with its own pre-employment checks policy, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign staff is available".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value these comments will bring", he said.
The Scottish Health Authority has reported that there are currently 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the High Authority noted that these figures are likely to be higher also because the Commissions had trouble identifying residence permit staff.
The investigation also found that the established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the pre-employment control policy and guidelines for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to finish this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport".
It also added that the Scottish Government, in consultation with the Health Committees, would consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices are reflected in the updated pre-employment control guidelines for all staff, including foreign staff, which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division dominated the film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The awards were also won by Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and Toby Kebell, who also played the supporting role.
Lady Judi Dench was named best actress for her role in the thriller Notes on Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for bringing a British film to the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But he won two awards for best director and best debut director to Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner - as Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The best actor award was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London thriller The Eastern Promise.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for being tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British cinema.
The fifty-something, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' next film, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the Camelot and Harry Potter films, Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me", he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored".
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury comprising filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 people for terrorism conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on the spiritual and security forces.
State television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells was trying to infiltrate the country with rockets.
Al Qaeda supporters have been campaigning against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, the invasion of Iraq.
Television reports have reported that a cell of eight militants led by an alien was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to defend facilities from al Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry: 18 of those arrested were from a cell led by a "missile firing expert" who snuck into the country.
She also said the militants were planning to penetrate the kingdom with eight rounds.
22 detainees were to prepare for the murder of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting with allied forces and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by calls from al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces over the past... five months", a State Department spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was aimed at promoting "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who promote violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place for life.
Data from the European orbiting station shows that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's twins than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit around similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the frightening greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rotational speeds have sent Venus on a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by storms and hurricane-force winds.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a modest view of how the Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago".
Police have seized "enriched uranium"
A kilos of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material is under investigation.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
♪ Still smoking ♪
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from Snow White.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube where ordinary voters uploaded their questions to video and passed them on to candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as humorous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading for next year's election.
It's unclear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, picked the clips and then showed them to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-sided debate, was about immigration.
This is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn around when they heard something pleasant: The voter recorded the heights of approval when the candidates spoke about tough border access.
The hardest and longest exchange of views has been between Red Giuliani, the top national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who has pushed forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
The two were particularly fierce when the questionnaires asked whether any of the candidates would support 'amnesty' (giving illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have been able to put a little bit of a splash on this topic.
Neither one of them has a chance to be nominated, but they both stay in the game because they started raising immigration alarms earlier and stronger than the others.
At least the candidates have the same view on immigration: greater border control, no tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns about the world around us, helps Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when other topics came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani, in his own words, said that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -- who is now the number one contender in a recent poll in Iowa because of his longstanding Christian conservatism -- said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether to accept, Jesus said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning laughter.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa is overshadowed by recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheer at Wednesday's debate.
These two have been pushed back from the bottom because the two sides still cannot agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincingly with a winning report on American size on his lips, blinking on both sides of the party.
This time the party is split and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour's pain
Gordon Brown has again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a common practice in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders appear to have been sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extra-marital rings have been stolen.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have survived without being discovered that some wealthy businessman had for four years hidden the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party had not announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the investigation, there was hope that it would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of the increasingly funny wording of the Liberal Democrat vice chairman, the once-feared Mr. Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unplundered rescue of the troubled Northern Rock Bank has shown weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Misguided proposals to change the tax code have united companies against the government.
The loss of personal data for 25 million people exposed unimaginable administrative mischief.
Three retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military spending, claiming that being the commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now, here are the many-sided gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's secretary general (and their former disciplinarian), has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is bound to his end.
Yet governments can reach a point of transition beyond which they find governance difficult.
People don't trust and hate politicians, but they usually lose their trust when a new party takes over.
Now that it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to make any improvements, and may not even be in office for long, this rejection is gone: the state administration is becoming a hole, ministers are starting to make briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming decentralized and defensive.
In one sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, since he cannot take the position of the newest member of the House of Commons, unlike other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the Northern Rock problems and the IRS records are linked to decisions Mr. Brown made as Treasurer.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in Blairite malpractice, like the lengthy investigation into political party funding caused by "value-for-money" voters can safely say he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they seem.
These raids aren't as awful as the conservatives make them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been deceived.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies always promised: a reliable, firm, and lightly brutal government.
The latest political gift-giving riot is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he didn't want publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but he didn't make the decision.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams's move but didn't know it was illegal, will surely be thoroughly questioned; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour money-seeker who learned of the fraudulent donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved in any way; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these scandals, although the bulk of the payments were made after his inauguration in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the law on his own, but he betrayed his resolve by resorting to a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons aren't complicated.
If there's been a violation of the law, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, like find a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one in six months, and move on to a real reform of party funding.
That would require the hard-line Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives are now well ahead of the ballot; he has two years to win back the votes; and the only way to win is with unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis affecting the U.S. credit card market?
When blood is in the water, the spinal fins naturally begin to move around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is in a slump, predators have turned to the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer credit options were infected by subprime mortgages.
The signs of tension are clear.
Increasing number of default cases (with more than 30 days of payment delay) and cancelled accounts (accounts deemed irrevocable by the provider).
HSBC last month announced that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it's too early to panic.
The accounts written and the inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody's, the third quarter default rate of 3,89% was almost an entire percentage point below average.
The deterioration of the rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 amendment to the US Bankruptcy Code led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders deteriorated.
The sector also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And trust in the securities of the secured credit cards is stable, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that emissions will increase by 25% over last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread the infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when real estate loans run dry, consumers are more likely to borrow through credit cards.
However, credit card issuers are more concerned with cash flow than collateral values, so falling house prices may not necessarily change the credibility of lenders.
They may even be beneficial to lenders.
The incentive for consumers to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers can also respond to more volatile conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid price changes in the guaranteed items.
"We're not going to be able to just reevaluate all loans one fine morning", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
While the risk of a subprime mortgage explosion is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for the back flies.
British bankers have pleaded guilty to Enron.
Three British bankers who were due to be tried for their role in a fraud involving former Enron financial executive Andrew Fastow changed their plea on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally denied the seven fraud charges they had filed with Fastow in 2000 for participating in financial fraud -- getting rich on their employers' accounts -- but they were acquitted.
They were supposed to be in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front page for two years during the issuance proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of the investigation that began after the Enron crash in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 pointed to Mr Fastow as the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The lawsuit against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "The NatWest Tribe" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to frame a fraud with Fastow and his former chief executive Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner Enron subsidiary controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a number of Enron scams that pushed Enron into a spiral of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Britons knew it was actually of considerable value.
The Kopper-controlled company bought a stake in this branch for $1 million.
The criminalised bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others were fined about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three British citizens were on bail for $1 million, which ordered them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks that made it impossible to hide billions in debt or to report failed speculation as profitable.
The collapse has eliminated thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were dropped after he died of a heart attack last year.
Moscow's powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, powered by a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the rich Russians, though, it's a small amount to pay back.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many seats because it's for a close family or a corporate president".
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Exposition, a four-day consumer spectacle orgy at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers set up their booths hoping that the newly wealthy Russians would attract everything from mahogany-packed yachts to diamond-decorated car blinds to cars they wouldn't be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's five and ten against us", he said.
"Russia is the second largest private jet market after the United States".
Oil waves are pouring money into the Russian capital just like they did in Dallas.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got very rich and moved to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists", said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's leading spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference drew on Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine's list of richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined net worth of $282 billion.
In addition, a report by the local Center for Economic and Financial Research on personal wealth development in the former Soviet Union found that there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, with a combined net worth of $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15,8% of Russians lived below the threshold of the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing manager at London jewellery store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly dressed and men are all for a fortune".
When they were walking around in evening gowns on a Sunday night, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five years older Svetlana Turovtsov identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche", said Miss Yumatov, who dressed up in branded clothes as a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a homemaker.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the freshly-made wealthy, brand-controlled Russian shoppers who are willing to sit for hours in traffic to walk around the warehouse that cries out to the Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom ballrooms, apartments in Dubai, Gund floats and a driveway.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft's stand before reproducing Rembrandt's hand-painted blue tile painting in life-size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gold".
And indeed, local sellers say that Russians with old money (which is 10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have moved from flashy logs to little-known limited edition brands that would never show up at a shopping mall.
Yet thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries or ordinary tourists, flooded the fairgrounds every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil Bed, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere and cotton mattresses wrapped in gold thread for $70,000.
On the same day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, a high-end car maker of high-end alarms, said that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer, said he sold three chainsaw-style bracelets for a Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that was woven with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a peach leather bicycle or a curved zirconia portrait of his wife doesn't have to ride those bicycles yet", said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage for 30 to 40 cars".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" doesn't mean anything too exclusive at the moment, given the huge increase in real estate prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more than you think".
Those who aren't millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a booth run by the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company has erected four British-style red telephone booths filled with columns of fake $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires' Market.
The roamers would stop to throw around a pile of money, or to get their friends to take a picture of them on their cell phone while they rest amidst a spare fortune, or simply fill their pockets with a few million dollars.
"You know, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire", said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a failed surgery.
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the large windows of a somewhat healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance approach a white New England house two blocks down West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car was attached.
And then another.
"Then I saw the forensic van arrive", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope toxicology tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief to the Newark police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious, and hardworking", Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me".
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Nevada State Police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she is survived by two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankowa, said detectives are trying to determine whether Miss Arroy died from unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options", said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is ongoing".
Officials said they arrived at the house at about 3:00 p.m.
They found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, who is said to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged rose bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the basement, he put a blue barrel of "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - in an open garage.
Two mountain bikes were hanging on the side of the hill.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy provided invaluable assistance in dealing with the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful of this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
The Fed's hope of lowering interest rates leads to a strengthening of global markets
Shares on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve would try to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were bolstered by reassuring statements by the US central bank's vice president.
Stock markets have jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, said managers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to continued pressure on financial markets.
In an apparent effort to calm the volatile markets amid signs of a revival of credit efforts, Mr Kohn said that recent upheavals "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets in late September and October".
It also stated that if the increased instability persists, the financial conditions of households and businesses will be likely to deteriorate further.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to add fresh capital gains to the US markets, and perhaps further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, when housing sales in October were record low.
The effects of the financial meltdown were underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost reductions to offset heavy losses caused by an unfair bet on subprime mortgages in the United States.
Only 20 of these locations are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index strengthened by 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, while the value of British blue-chips rose by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets were at full strength after the European Central Bank auction of three-month money packages lent the funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release surplus money into London's money markets increased as the three-month UK interbank lending rate of Libor rose after a steady growth from 12 November to its highest since the end of September - 6.59%.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six in the England batting this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopar?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds the position at his best in the time he has borrowed, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to help decide and because the table of Hugh Morris, the head manager of the England team, is starting to fill with applications for the national selection, albeit not necessarily full-time.
The one who doesn't get the sixth spot on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sports are not at all.
It's not easy to find what gets one to the top of their profession, while someone else never gets past the bottom, sometimes because of lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is difficult and requires an assessment that ultimately must always be subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to the Shah if it is?
We could ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and background in the field, should be promoted to the commission -- the seat is for one.
Who's to say what level is right for a cricketer if he can't get a chance to go down or swim to the next level?
Naturally, numbers have a big influence on decision making, but they also have opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he is to take a wicket, and a batsman needs regular chances at starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as an ODI cricketer.
Capturing the look of the selector is more complicated.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose first Test place seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and threw like a marksman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at an average of 33.
Chris Tremlett took 29 on the same sloppy average, but they both had their moments at their highest level and are hoping for the next.
Whether he'll play at the Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara may be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or affect the careers of both, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago, Gareth Batty played in every Test at Sri Lanka and had good first-class performances, five wickets and 40 free throws, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who is also, despite scoring twice a hundred in Australia against Australia, still perhaps underrated.
It's more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today's training, purely at the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful hustle.
There are arguments for both.
Shaha is talking about his sparkling and valuable Test debut in 88 Tests in Bombay and 32 first-class centuries against six Bopars, who are, at twenty-two, seven years younger and have excellent statistics against spin-offs.
However, Shah made just ten runs in two innings against the Caribbean in May at the Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and that, coupled with the immediate rejection of the selections when Vaughan wanted to re-sign him for the next match, his firing seemed to have taken away something from the deer that was so evident in Bombay.
The Essex universe, on the other hand, has the joie de vivre in its bones.
He is not afraid of anything on the cricket pitch, and his off-the-field behaviour symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the car show day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He left with minor injuries and apparently shock, but first he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow player who was watching from afar, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-fast slugging overalls on the pitches he seems to be comfortable with, delivering efficiently and firing confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I personally tend to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Ceylon tea tickets suggest, he is the one who will be playing next weekend.
Buses are bringing refugees back to work and fight al Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and discharging refugees who ran out of money or their visas expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansur bus station was already there before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the papers, what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Muktadi al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to cease fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called him, saying that the local militia, backed by the US military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is a Sunni and Shia tribal leader who was expelled from his home in Sleiq, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that they were running a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleiq and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today", said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the appeal of the capital's appeal to calm after the strengthening U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who, armed with arms alongside the U.S. military, defend their neighborhood.
But more about how they were forced to return was the obstruction of visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, has voiced a common suspicion among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees and thus force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis so they could return to Iraq", said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the easing of violence is the fact that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again fuel sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Sarajevo, good education
The smallest federal state of Germany is a leader in vocational education, even excelling in the international focus of its universities.
In one area of education only, the deficit is as much a concern as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Sarkozy, I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Sarkozy on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarsk education system, which is ranked fifth in the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) education monitoring.
Higher education institutions have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Today, students can graduate with a double or even triple degree.
This is corresponding to a relatively high proportion of international students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the over-average number of Saracens are admitted to college - many without a high school diploma.
"The vocational education system is in place in Sarasota", says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
With more than one in five adolescents getting a scholarship to study in a vocational school, Sarasota is over 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of opportunities in Saransk to combine practical and academic education.
The study opportunities in two fields are the second best in all of Germany in terms of population.
Despite practical education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That's why the Sara school ministry has now ordered universities to create a promotion campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we made several reforms in public schools", says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
To get children to start learning as early as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal countries have adopted.
If the results of the students improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
The Pisa study in 2003 reduced the proportion of at-risk pupils from 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, the country has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of Sarkozy, the Pisa studies do not compare foreign language skills - otherwise, Sarkozy could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in the secondary schools - even if the residents of Sarsa are not French.
The clock is moving
Soon, hours will be different in Venezuela than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock moved back half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, Chavez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that under the new law, the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours from world time.
The South American state will be in a time zone that no other country in the world has.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the United States imposing a worldwide time zone of full-hour intervals.
On Wednesday, Chávez announced that he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it anymore for my self-esteem", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of this oil-rich country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
This reform would greatly strengthen Chavez's power in the country.
The controversy has led to Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages in Colombia with Marxist rebels.
Uribe "spit in Venezuela's face" with his decision, he criticised Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile phone call has sparked a stir: "Por qué no te callas" - a phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
It was delivered by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at a recent Ibero-American summit was so upset by the left-wing populist's loud remarks that he silenced him.
The Germans are at risk of lower wages in 2007
The forecast is that this year, despite strong economic conditions, German workers will face a decline in real wages.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 the people employed can expect to receive less pay than last year.
"The reason for this is a small increase in wages, a rise in value-added tax and an increase in food and energy prices", said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) research institute.
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3,3% by the new year was correct and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Labour Agency should never again be in such a difficult situation that it has to ask for loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspapers of this social democratic policy quoted.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, the prices increased by 3% year on year.
Venus is the Hell Twin of Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more like Earth than previously thought, and the European space probe Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and winds at the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that there is a flash on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - it has picked up electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere, and lightning is flying from cloud to cloud at a height of about 35 miles [56 km], wrote Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
According to a well-known theory of the origin of primordial matter, lightning may have created life on Earth, and storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
"If life ever existed on Venus, it must have been long ago", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus, and the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach about 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the hell twin of Earth, but it's a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Esa mission.
Since no spacecraft has been launched exclusively for the study of Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express spacecraft in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of the research, presented in several articles in the journal Nature, did not just highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously thought", Esa said.
In addition to the already known North Pole wind vortices, scientists have found a cloud vortice at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost as massive as Earth and, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, is almost as big.
This planet, known as the Morning or Evening, orbits the Sun in just under 225 days.
But it rotates much slower around its own axis, and one day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar, does not resemble Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both sides, but on Earth it remained in the oceans while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is carbonated on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to party disputes over the admission of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
He directly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor's office after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the great coalition to end the feud over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue", Köhler told the Handelsblatt economic newspaper.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt the Dalai Lama in September.
"While I respect cultural differences, I believe human rights are universal", said Köhler.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knew that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too", said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his disapproval of the Dalai Lama's adoption, and has been attacked by coalition members.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the "predictive" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the Dalai Lama's accession to the chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government withdrawn the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also in China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar unrest in France
Street fights with police, gunfire, burned cars, Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that have erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating into street violence, the interior minister urges.
Barricades were burning, rioters fired guns at police, and after the violent riots of young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create social tensions that result in violence in our own country.
We have to take this seriously", he told the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with the rapidly changing social realities.
The federal government, the states and the municipalities are already working hard to solve the problems, Schäuble said.
Which is not just about integrating migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we're seeing first-hand successes".
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
Last night, teenagers and police in the northern suburbs of Paris were engaged in a fierce street fight.
There were also fires in Toulouse on cars and public buildings.
The German government's greater integration efforts were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the wake of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "mimic effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Still, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, unemployment rates are "over-average".
In particular, more study opportunities need to be provided.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give the youth hope".
The Turkish mayor added, however, that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater family social control.
Moreover, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"But we must be careful", Kolat urged.
We must "quickly enable young people to start working and getting an education".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police were deployed and a helicopter with headlights was flying over the area.
Authorities have reported three arrests and several burned trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, there have been about 1,000 law enforcement officers deployed to maintain the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots in Toulouse began.
The disorder was caused by a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the state attorney's office's initial findings, the police have no responsibility for the deaths of juveniles.
In the realm of the angels of the clouds
The Chancellor's remote reality output documents that the coalition is at the end of its program and that we can expect nothing more from it itself.
What country does this chancellor actually live in?
After her discouraging, indifferent and poorly-sounded speech at the General Debate of the Federal Parliament, we must say: not here - not in this country which she is supposed to rule.
To the regret that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded with a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are about.
She made it clear to everyone in the House of Commons how much she deserves the remorse.
Merkel had no real interest in the country, let alone the problems.
Instead, Angela "The Cloud" was introduced: a politician who stands out above others, who runs away from foreign policy and even there speaks only in a vague way.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how to achieve the climate targets in Germany.
And, anyway, a car like that-- so much of a disrespect would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
Now she's confined to flat phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
This approach undermines its image of pragmatism, which does not need flattery because it solves problems.
But in the realm of Angelus the Clouds, internal political problems are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage people?
She's got a couple of extra sentences to go on these topics.
It's remarkable how often Merkel is overreacting when it comes to child support.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times to say the right sentence, at least in part.
Once things get too specific, he trips off like he's in a completely foreign field.
The Division Attack
The debate over Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has been a heated debate over the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first issue.
Mitt Romney is telling his rival, Rudy Giuliani, that he has made New York a "hostage for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp complaints: "I think his own house was just one such refuge", and he accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Since the Republican base has yet to have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos made by Internet users and sent via YouTube serve only as clues to a key topic.
"It is precisely through this policy of isolationism that we allowed Hitler to seize power", John McCain suggests to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one to push for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain is not sparing his regrets, nor Romney's, for refusing to condemn a torture interrogation method called "Waterboarding", which simulates warming.
Public reaction in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that the Iraq War and methods of torture are not among the major themes of the campaign.
The audience will applaud whenever conservative values are praised and any future tax increases rejected.
That'll show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong then", Romney explains in a crush, asking the party base and television audience for forgiveness for being a supporter of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to speak out against literal interpretation of the Bible.
The first time a man has ruled in a civilian
The day after his resignation as the Supreme Commander of the Army, the ruler of Pakistan, Musharraf, took the presidential oath.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parvez Musharraf took the presidential oath on Thursday, and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place at the presidential palace in the capital city of Islamabad.
The Musharraf swore to honor the Constitution and to strive for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army commander to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyan, putting himself under international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is reigning for the first time as civilian head of state.
By stepping down as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another key requirement is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after taking his oath, fulfilling other Western demands.
The country's Supreme Court, which had seized Musharraf's favored lawyers after a state of emergency was declared in early November, last week rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The father of the cowboy is coming back
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again, and three members of Harmonia have taken their electronic synthesizers back to their Berlin concert.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already much more well known abroad.
The announcement of the sensation then consists of a performance by three sitting gentlemen who at first appear to be enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and, most importantly, buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 60, in a snow-white shirt, is sitting in the middle.
On his left is a 50-year-old Michael Rother, with a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is concentrated bending over the synthesizers, is on the right from the audience's perspective.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, it's a traditional song.
It seems that the gentlemen of the orchestra are not too concerned.
The revival of the band Harmonia caused considerable stir among the lovers of Krautrock.
One thing is worth noting here, that repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of the collective consciousness of pop, it is certainly not so far-fetched that anyone has been missing this band for 23 years.
But why couldn't a German celebrate his still-living 1970s legends?
Especially when you value the style of music, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than you do in your own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of Cologne's Can Echo Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, the hall was filled with the quirky looks of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! for their speech, the audience's astonishment was overwhelming.
Michael Rother later appeared on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia, we overload our memory unnecessarily, this trio only existed for two years and even then it was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They first performed in the basement of the Schaubühne theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-run phonograph company.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but he only gained fame as the guitarist of Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in the Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, ruins of the 16th century, they lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in the First Commune, where Roedelius was still allowed to nurse.
It was more like living in a Spitzer-German artistic being.
The name for the art is said to be derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was allegedly found in the rubbish bin.
Harmony kept a lot of that.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next was "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and modest, the band was struggling financially.
Gathering the plants was not just about getting to know yourself.
The newly released Live 1974 CD was reportedly cut in front of a record-breakingly small, barely 50-member set during a concert in Griesen.
Rothera expressed a desire that the members of the Harmony should exhale and exercise occasionally.
Roedlia and Moebia, it was a very rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their split.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since become more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label Grönland has taken the goal of preserving krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Neu! was considered Roedel's solo work at the time.
The incarnate resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The Woldtronics Festival performance will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cope, old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler manual will be present.
Love Parade founder Dr. Motte will also attend.
So we've outlined the overall extent of the impact of the Krautrock on the future of pop music.
The space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Ann's line, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats through the hall: "The only true music belongs to the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in the farmer's chair.
The legend is also made possible by the depiction of other black and white photographs, which feature a set of devices wired in the wild.
Before that, those three veterans are back on the job of improvising.
No longer by gluing microphones to horns and drums to play out the never-before-heard-of-them tunes.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of defeating the punters.
The House of World Cultures choir doesn't change that.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, under the sound clouds, a whisper is heard and in one beautiful place, an emphatic "Aaaaaaaa!" is sung.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We'd rather find roots in music colleges (Can), technology (Kraftwerk), or the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who's shouting "68" here isn't that far from the truth, but Harmonia won't be left out of the loop.
Even the most obvious is thought through on stage.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question will either make you nervous or make you feel happy for a moment.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the Balkan War were released.
But neither of them is convincing.
The film's presentation either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or it's too moving.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop that from happening in The Hunting Party.
The good news is that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but right there, in the shadowy backdrop of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere will be killed.
Recently, we've lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played many nice, minor roles in cool women's films, but in connection with his press conferences forever on Buddhism, people will take the appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Huntsman Becomes a Decoy (Why do movie titles have to be so long and wrapped these days?).
His war correspondent Simon Hunt is basically who Gere might have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful: a man who, although his best years have long since passed, still retains a remarkable charm as a wreck-like monument.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, also entering theaters this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of failed films about the Balkan War.
With Mörderischer Frieden, we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not portrayed as the cause of all evil here, this TV shallow film is turning too soon into a shooting and action.
The movie will be very much like Cobra 11, with no highway, but with the war.
The film The Hunting Party provides a clear explanation of why the Balkan War has not been a really good film so far.
The story of three American war reporters posing as "the man", a Serbian top war criminal, could at another time, under the direction of another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard) perhaps become a new "Apocalypse".
The two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something that the military can't do, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons The Hunting Party failed is that Simon Hunt is not the hot-headed, sentimental cynic we introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal would also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party can finally be written off after the last five minutes of the fast-paced film, the reporters do what NATO, the CIA and all the world's crime hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminals and leave them to the just vengeance of Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worthwhile to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
And yet this film has a profoundly human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are exceptionally united) that under secret political agreements persecution is not intensified enough.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women are fascinated by Brecht's famous poem.
It's about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the veins on my forehead, noting: how tiring it is to be evil".
Movies like The Hunting Party have these exact headlines, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of the Balkan war.
Recently, these papers reported that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
One thing to add: No good film has ever been made about South Africa.
Almost always: When a star strolls through a crisis zone or runs through a minefield, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, The Frontier with Angelina Jolie, or The Blood Diamond with Leonard DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film, Schindler's List.
Many films must, apparently, mature - films now considered classics of Vietnam - "Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse", or "The Hunted Vests" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at that time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder in the home is instantly shown on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
And the screenwriters don't have the skills to tell good stories without error.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" had become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet realized how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to develop a sarcastically balanced artistic outlook like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said: "The only similarity is that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in terrible ways and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust reaping criticism for refusing the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from the Hamburg Summer Olympics has met with sharp criticism from politics and economics.
Many want to keep fighting for water games.
But von Beust is encouraging realism in the estimation of chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "unfortunate from a business perspective" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently aroused in the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm at such a high level".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide the Olympic candidate", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sporting Föderation will decide on the candidate of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference for us means that with a timeline starting in 2028, we have no realistic chance".
Yet this dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) has called von Beust's comments regrettable.
It's a good feeling that Hamburg won't be interested in hosting the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to destroy the chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage", HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The refusal to participate would be contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German Universities' Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the University of Hamburg in 2015 as a substitute for the Olympics.
The Hamburg High School Athletic Association nominated him as a candidate city just last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate has accused it of wasting valuable time that could be used to build housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on the Olympics and ruled out housing construction", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook still planned the Olympics with the whole area later being used for housing purposes, the CDU voted unanimously on the "Olympic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg was a time of great excitement.
But the hamburger crashed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The person who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but of Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes made in Sweden today cast dark shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of his list of 94 Stockholm-type "Brillo boxes" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo boxes" a few months ago, internal research at Moderna Museet in Stockholm came with a disappointing result; the six "Brillo boxes" donated to Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other Stockholm-style "Brillo boxes" in circulation on the international art market.
The events that precede it are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden boxes based on the red-brick design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 featured - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes, which were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't artwork, it was their presentations, just exhibits.
Warhol apparently also authorized several wooden Brillo bodies in Sweden in 1968, but they are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses there now speak of 15 boxes that were then rightfully registered in art and auction history as authorized originals -- "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" labeled the Stockholm Type.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred pieces were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén bodies were only produced in Malmö for the Petrograd exhibition in 1990.
By this time Warhol was three years old.
Lars Byström, senior curator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their tiles had been painted with base paint and polished, were painted with oil white brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, showed that the paint was applied by a painter's roll directly on the slate without the previous base coating - in addition, it was acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list", Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve was quoted as saying: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies".
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would address these "major charges" raised in the case of soap boxes.
But the organization remains in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered, who had enclosed a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denies responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government have earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had enclosed the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him apparently joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Government loyalist forces have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency cabinet meeting.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of the soldiers.
"The people have had enough", Triallnes said.
"We're calling on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the elite Scout Rangers, said that more troops would soon join the march.
Critics of the government have called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
The financial district of Manila became the main site of a revolt of about 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatile
United Internet has secured a more than 20% stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is EUR 14.46.
The company is said to now own 20,05% of the share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover before.
The company still expects to increase its stake in Versatel further.
United Internet announced that it was seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market by taking this step.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by an additional 5% to 15,1%, the entry agreement was reached on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares for a third party only.
Yesterday, United Internet owned a nearly 10 percent stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put up another 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
Of that total, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the DSL and mobile network areas.
"We are strengthening our partnership", explained a spokesman for United Internet.
In order to take over the competitor Freenet, the companies jointly set up a joint venture between the SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies were satisfied with a stake of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over another 18,49% of the company.
It is assumed that the companies will keep all options open for the time being, in particular the possibility to increase their stake in Freenet AG further.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and hardly transparent Freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2,9 million mobile network contract customers and 1,27 million full or DSL customers at the end of the third quarter.
United Internet and Drillische Holding held a 6.01% stake in Freenet until now.
Now, it's been said that it's been agreed that Drillisch will get about another 4%.
The purchase of 18,49% of Vatas' investment was agreed in August.
