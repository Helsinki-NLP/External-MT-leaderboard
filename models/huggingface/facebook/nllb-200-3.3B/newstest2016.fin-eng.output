A 9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere
Police have been on a search for a 9-year-old boy who escaped from a house in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing boy who went missing from West Tampere with his friend has been reported on social media.
The police have confirmed that the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life or health.
The boy's father told the Night-Sanom at midnight, knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the post-conviction process.
The boy was found near the home, his father said.
Ronaldo , in a frenzy , tore the goal away from Messi .
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his performance in the Champions League.
The battle for the Champions League title between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo turned, at least for a moment, in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved into the all-time goal-scoring lead by himself, after he scored two penalties and one game-ending shot into the net of visiting Shahtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo has raised his goal count to 80, after the Barcelona Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has a total of 77.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been struggling in Serie A since the start of the season, but they started strong in the Champions League D with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal came with just over ten minutes to go from Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The City attack was hampered by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who suffered a knee injury.
Aguero, who was injured in the playoffs this weekend, didn't get on the court until the final 10 minutes.
Manchester United's second team also suffered in the Netherlands after losing 1-2 against PSV Eindhoven.
The visiting match between ManU's 20-year-old defensive end Luke Shaw and the team will only last for 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slip-call hit the goal against the attacking ManU pack so hard that Shaw likely broke a leg.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors in the 41st minute to take a 1-0 lead, but the ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened it out in extra time before the break.
PSV's winning goal came in the second half from Luciano Narsingh.
The Champions League season started with Paris Saint-Germain in the A division.
The case involved the Argentine Angel Di Maria, who had switched from Manchester United to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wilandin.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 to PSG in the second half.
PSG are the odds-on favourites for the title.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the minor league teams, is not the best possible point of reference.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his first professional match against his former team Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team, Moscow TsSKA, lost in the B-Block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation . The president made a false speech .
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has repeated the speech he made at the end of last month in the country's parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize it was the same speech.
The speech raised doubts about whether 91-year-old Mugabe was in full health.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded that Mugabe resign from his post, saying he was too old to govern.
Mugabe's supporters rushed to say that the interference had been solely at the Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr. Mugabe's speech was about China's influence on the economy, both before and now.
Germany and Austria call for extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week because of the refugee crisis.
The summits were chaired by European Council President Donald Tusk, who assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register migrants more effectively.
The EU is also committed to the principle of subsidiarity, which is a fundamental principle of the Treaty.
Teacher admits shooting his girlfriend during a 911 call
Noise. A slightly colored college professor named Shannon Lamb is on a 911 call to tell the police that she shot her girlfriend and that the cops need to come to their house.
Lamb said that his "golden dog" was alive and probably upset, and that the contact information for the dead woman's relatives was on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on the side of the door: "I am so sorry I wish I could undo this love I have for Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me", said the letter, which experts believe is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-known history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university officials heard gunfire at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more, as Lamb committed suicide while surrounding the police station.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive a day after students and staff were forced to hide behind locked doors in the wake of a school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released data that students and staff described Lambia as a gifted teacher who may have had problems.
Students told him they were waiting for his feelings.
Police in Gautier County, where Prentiss was killed, say Lamb had no violent history or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked the 'wonderful people' with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the pupils attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of trouble.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had earlier requested a medical leave from Delta State University, stating that he had some kind of medical problem.
This year, she only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career advancement and an associate professorship.
The university president, William LaForge, said that to his knowledge there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was clear that something was on Lamb's mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb fled the campus, police tracked him down as he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running on the sidewalk.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb joined the university in 2009 and taught geography and education.The university has 3,500 students and is located in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb earned his doctorate in educational psychology this spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston was friends with in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were melting when he was there, said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of any kind of marriage between the two of them.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they had separated 15 years ago but remained friends, and they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset", O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
Austin said he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together in comedy recitals.
Austin told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room, a murky bar near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a small audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were joking and throwing punches at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
The deceased teacher Schmidt was the director of a first-year student seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was the spokesman for the fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candlelight vigil was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including faculty and staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also participated in the Mass, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The class will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press correspondent Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to the report.
The story has been corrected to say that the police now say Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to pay fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it is not hiring as many workers for the holiday season as last year, but the toy and baby retailer says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 hired in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said that the interviews for applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although months away from the holiday season, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with store occupancy and the selling, shipping, and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge moment in Michael J. Fox's professional life.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's seat was next to mine", she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts, and it occurs to me that I'm just a fake kiss and a handshake away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the Back to the Future film, featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production manager Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it is without a doubt the greatest time travel movie ever made".
Back in Time is available on video on demand, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says the Syrian situation cannot be resolved by military means.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this almost five-year-old conflict "cannot be resolved by armed force" and additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief reiterated his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
The EU's foreign policy is based on the principle of 'no-deal', which is the principle of non-aggression.
He regretted that the division between the Council, the Syrian people and regional powers had made the situation impossible to resolve.
The five permanent members were urged to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they showed in agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 of the polls that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a wind whisperer.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to weed out Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In 10 of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has led with double digits, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's nomination prospects.
I mean, the election season's just beginning.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become the Republican nominee.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom backed any state in the nominating process.
There are also many reasons why he would have a problem in the general election.
But outside groups, like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth, have noticed Trump's persistence and have begun using their resources to bring him down.
The following recent survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have gone through a complete reversal.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's approval polls showed that only two Republicans in ten favored the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 percent.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they have a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy to see Trump run.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 said they would be "shocked" if he was nominated.
Ben Carson alone generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "enthusiasm" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
What's the next most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio is only at 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "displeased" or "shocked" if the incumbent's favorite, Jeb Bush, were to run.
Trump's fiery temper is not a problem for most Republicans.
Despite Donald Trump being widely criticized for his high-fiving speeches and insults, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationally think the real estate king is a presidential fit.
A poll by Quinnipiac last week found the same number in Iowa, the state hosting the first Republican convention: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the characteristics of a leader.
But an ABC/Post poll found that 44 percent of Americans think his character is unsuitable for the presidency, and nearly six in 10 think his character doesn't belong in the White House.
Republican voters will get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like the commentators, they think Trump is the real alternative.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of 10 people thought Trump was the most likely choice when asked who was most likely to be nominated for the Republican nomination.
And yet, at the end of July, four out of ten voters still voted for Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters haven't always had the brightest crystal ball.
Last term, at this time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry should be the nominee, and only 28% supported the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Anyway, this shows that the majority of Republican voters believe in the Trump campaign.
Even if the Republicans were to endorse the other candidate, Trump would still win almost every one of them.
Some commentators have noted that the fragmented field is likely to have favored Trump's lead, as anti-Trump support is divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical two-way race between Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump gets the majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13, Marco Rubio with 14, Walker with 15, Jeb Bush with 19 and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat Trump?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a whopping 18 points.
Just as the majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump voters have decided who they're voting for.
Of course, circumstances can change, and no one can be absolutely sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said they would be willing to switch candidates.
Anyway, Trump's biggest competitor right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "racketeers" in his campaign inaugural address two months ago, immigration has been the focus of the 2016 debate.
Some worry that Trump's power-play will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt re-branding efforts.
A new ABC/Post poll released Monday shows six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is the center of things, so too is Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government has reached a new high.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican electorate, due in large part to their standing outside of politics.
Six out of 10 Republicans in an ABC/Post poll on Monday said they'd rather pick someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They're also angry at the federal government.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll from Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "very angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Hour.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be able to take a decision on the matter by the end of the year.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show to be "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he could leave some of the arrangements to his colleagues.
This is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the trade union federation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silent during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service, held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from Conservative MPs and featured in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's spokesman said he was "respectfully silent" and that he was "recognizing the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the air warfare of Great Britain".
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told the BBC's Twon Newsnight programme that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he thought the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be drawn into Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences over economic, defence and foreign policy, and less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially backed him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that the party's position on the European Union and the government's funding gap has "declined" within the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the trade union federation that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's Labour and Pensions secretary, Smith, said the party had been "quite clear" that they were only opposing the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to meet David Cameron in the last decade as leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has 'picked up' ideas for questions to the prime minister and received over 30,000 proposals.
The Islington North MP, Corbyn, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he intends to refrain from both clever rhetoric and sarcasm, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's finance secretary, Angela Eagle, will act as his deputy during question times when Corbyn is not present - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
The Commission is also proposing that other Members should be allowed to speak at times, and has said that it has approached the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, on the matter.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theatre that is often associated with Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later admitted that he had failed.
Since the introduction of the television quiz in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Hour has been an important measure of the Leader's discretion, his management of the House of Commons, and his standing with other MPs, although critics have criticized the quiz as having become a mere mockery that demands far-reaching reforms.
In Joburg: Homeless youths trained as photographers

The value of the pound rises as UK wages rise
The pound appreciated after the numbers showed a rise in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller's bid.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by estimates of a rise in exchange rates.
The pound rose by more than a percent against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84 percent against the euro to 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most prominent shareholder in the market and rose by 20% after its competitor AB InBev approached it with a bid.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from rival luxury group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected and showed that sales in China, Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
Glencore's stock rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond's shares were the largest losers in the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from a company to a 'sell' one.
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sports betting company released its half-year pre-tax profit: an 83 per cent increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports' CEO says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers in the UK is raised, it could mean that 'potential consumers' purchasing power is increased'.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be directed towards the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against the Aldi intrusion .
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food retailer Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South and Western Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA's merchants and buyers have jumped in, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA's stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metchas is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29th when this food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake, for South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of the area of Metcash's IGA stores, and they have higher profit margins than the IGA network of Metcash's eastern states.
The South and Western Australian shopping public is notoriously corner-oriented, and IGA's retailers have a much larger market share in the South and Western Australian markets than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the South and 24% in the West, compared with 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million in sales annually, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the South and 30 in the West next year, generating between $500 million and $600 million in sales in these regions.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes at the base of Metcash's high fixed costs could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the market share of the two companies in the investigation.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business panel in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly" be gone within a decade.
Metcash has refused to publicly respond to Douglas' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the MetCash board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the revenues of the food and food business of Metcash, which supplies about 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in debt financing of the operations in the face of pressure on sales and margins.
But the wholesaler is holding its own, and has invested over $150 million annually in bringing down the prices of hundreds of products every week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, in helping IGA retailers to refurbish their stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and in bringing a better selection of private label products to market.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that price cuts and store improvements have added traction and he hopes the wholesaler will return to earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Federation , Steve Healy , has come out in support of Thanasi Kokkinakis .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his conduct
The European Union is also calling for the release of the two former members of the group, who were arrested in the UK on Friday, and for the release of the three former members of the group, who have been detained in the UK on Friday.
The younger member of the talented duo known as Special Ks, Kokkinakis, was unintentionally drawn into the public spotlight by the incident in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a heated exhibition match in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate Kokkinakis from his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid".
Although Kokkinakis was last seen tearing up his bat after cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a stalwart defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the youngster is in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in a match with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I'm pretty sure Thanasi's just been dragged into the riot", Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat out of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he's behaved exceptionally well, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He's very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits in with the team and so on, and he's never had any problems with other players, and he's respected in the dressing room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, and he's a very calm and mature young man, and I think we should evaluate him on his merits.
Healy also supported the decision to exclude Kyrgios from the major games starting on Friday, describing the "joint decision" as a win-win solution, but still supporting the Canberra's return to the team's roster.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [the Kyrgyz]", Healy said.
And Nick has really moved up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's growing up in the public eye, and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye thinking about those consequences.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants entering the country.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in the neutral zone, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People fleeing violence in their homelands have now set up their tents and settled indefinitely on the crossroads between the two checkpoints in the country.
But the frustration grew.
As the police helicopter hovered above them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary, as more and more migrants were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
 Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The EU is also committed to the development of a common European defence policy.
The conflict on the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after the failure of a grouping of 28 nationalities at a contentious meeting on common immigration policy in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now invaded Italy and Greece, and they spoke with optimism about reaching a final agreement - by next month or the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in the additional 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit next Tuesday to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the EU, including the countries of the former Soviet Union, and to extend it to include the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country will also erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and entry point for refugees into the European Union, many of whom are fleeing the war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view strongly contradicted by other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to attempt to cross or damage the 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We're very clear about this: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected deployment of troops next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have already seen for days heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs.
Orban's national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already crossed.
They broke through the fence, they're now in police custody, and they're being charged with violations of the new laws.
The authorities are working to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a barbed-wire train car to close one of them.
The main crossing point near Hungary's Roszke was thrown into chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to storm in.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse to eat or drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
The 2016 election: A national polling report shows that Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed to a half.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but is being outplayed by Senator Bernie Sanders.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%) and second-place Sanders has 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he has the support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters.
With more than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided who they're voting for.
But Clinton supporters are more committed to their choice than are supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has been dropping in several demographic groups since the CBS News Poll last month, and at the same time, Sanders has been gaining some ground.
Clinton is strongly in the lead with women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
Her popularity with men has dropped dramatically, and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton's lead in the under-50 Democratic primary has been lost, and he's now on a par with Sanders.
But Clinton is clearly ahead of the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits over the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five points.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country say they'd be eager to support Clinton if he becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter say they support him with some reservations, and 15% would support him just because he's a candidate.
Six percent of the population would not support him at all.
It's not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confused with those who don't currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would be eager to support Clinton, fewer Republicans say the same about Republican number one, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When asked why they wanted her to run in the open question, Clinton supporters said that she had the experience to do so (16%), followed by the most popular answers that it was the right time for a woman to be president (13%), and that she was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president has a direct bearing on the presidential race, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race, even though a third disagree.
When asked who they would like to have as their second choice for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would vote for Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase by 20 percentage points if Biden goes, but by 30 if he drops out.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidency, but that number is down from 78 percent last month.
On this scale, Biden is far behind, but the percentage of those who believe he's the most likely to win the popular vote has increased.
But when asked what was most important to the candidate, Democratic voters put their opinion ahead of voter turnout.
Also, last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden is the best of the three in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically aligned.
So, looking at all these things, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinion of Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State continues to raise questions, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and say it did not affect their overall opinion of her.
But it's a different story when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanations, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say that email polemics have not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has declined.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
While voters in Clinton's own party consider her to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters, with only 32 percent considering her to be honest and trustworthy, a figure that has dropped 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest or trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't think Trump is honest or trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many people have no opinion about him, just as they don't have any opinion about Carson.
The margin of error in the poll of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the national poll.
Ben Carson is getting close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are picking up half the votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for the top spot.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, whose approval rating has risen from 23 percent in the CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News election debate to 27 percent in the poll released Tuesday.
But Carson's rate rose dramatically from 6 percent to 23 percent during the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups and is displacing Trump among the highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker having the biggest drop in support, from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error in this latest poll of 376 Republican voters, conducted in September, is +/- 6%.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson on the rise in the polls, with a 19 percent approval rating among Republicans, and Trump ahead at 32 percent.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump unnecessarily criticized the retired neurosurgeon, though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said Saturday during a campaign rally in Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College .
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternity memorial service in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun Michael Deng during a membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed in taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng was blindfolded and had a 40-pound bag of sand loaded on his back, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk across the icy field toward the finish line.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but they allegedly waited for an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
But they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the fraternity's national president, Andy Meng, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual items and thus, in effect, put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng", said Police Chief Wagner.
The Dengi couldn't be brought to a full recovery, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blows to the head, body and thighs from blunt force trauma.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity fraud, with at least one student dying every year since 1970", Doug Fierberg, the lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury has decided to charge the first five members of the jury with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also facing charges of violent incitement and criminal conspiracy.
'We do not want to hold individuals solely responsible, but if there is an organisation behind what happened that accepted the situation either officially or unofficially, they must also be held accountable,' Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity severed its ties with the local chapter.
This is what happens when the US central bank raises the interest rate
Interest rates will rise, and the rising market will collapse, bond yields will rise, and the economy will be in recession.
Here's what we know.
What we don't know is how long this is going to take or how long it's going to last.
The past is of little help in terms of timing, particularly in the economic sphere.
Recession income has lasted from the first pull sometimes only 11 months, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US central bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial resources.
That is why the Fed officials have been so vigorously pushing that investors should focus not on the fact that interest rates are about to rise, but on the development cycle of the period of normalization.
There are many variables in this equation.
However, in the end, the market participants may find that any interest rate-related distortion has been overstated.
"The central bank's first post-global economic crisis increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'bad money' era", said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect a gradual return to normal, albeit still lower, U.S. interest rates, for the kind of upheaval that many seem to fear.
But that doesn't mean it doesn't have an impact.
The following is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react to past developments:
As the market has seen over the last month or so, waiting for a rate hike can make the situation unstable.
When the elevation becomes a fact, the effect is not so dramatic.
"It seems that returns on capital tend to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after a central bank increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years or so, the market has generally been strong, rising by about 14% as it approaches the high, fairly flat after 250 days (average rise of 2.6%) and normal after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on equities is usually more pronounced at the later stage of the growth cycle, when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are a part of life, but interest rates often contribute to them.
In the present situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that it has not faced before and which may accelerate the recession.
This is particularly true of gross domestic product, which will be near its lowest level ever before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 drawings since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4,5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 saw a 3.6 percent increase, few believe it will last after the third quarter's 1.5 percent increase, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raises the question of whether this time is different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank raise all year, and everyone is looking forward to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe the committee may approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading forecasts only a 25% probability.
Our research shows that since 1950, all the bullish cycles have hitherto been characterised by an increasing leverage effect in supercycles, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery has begun, the report says.
In contrast, the recovery from the worst recession of the last decade has been exceptionally slow.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited far longer than the last recession, with a record of 35 months, and is now in its 74th month.
Fixed yields have also been unstable in anticipation of interest rate increases, and the pattern is somewhat similar to the findings on equity.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policy, its effects are more readily reflected in bonds than in shares.
The yield on bonds appears to change direction immediately on the first raise/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the interest cycle, the yield on bonds will immediately fall, Deutche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring the yields of longer and shorter-term bonds closer together, thus flattening the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better in this situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for yields", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adjusted to the central bank's policy expectations.
'In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,' he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies with a major presence in the US are winning as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt will do worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt more expensive than their financing.
History shows that high-quality shares tend to be more profitable in the three months following the first raise, Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their report to clients.
The companies with high turnover exceeded the companies with low turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on equity and low volatility stocks performed better than lower quality companies, with the former averaging 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with the most variable-rate debt are the ones that are losing the most, Goldman said.
Consumers outside the stock exchange are also able to benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
Savers may also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has accused the channel of "populism".
He argues that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial competitor.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
His fellow MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is 'changing' to Classic FM, argues the leading MP, adding to the pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's management that the public service radio channel appeared to be 'popular with its content' and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from its commercial rival.
'It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term 'audience' - is turning into Classic FM,' he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be just a different name from the Brit Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can remember, where you're actually just copying something that's already on the market", Bingham said.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals in live music and information sharing with the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn from anything else.
Its commitment to live music and musical performance is actually first-rate.
'I also think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and to commissioning new works,' he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's head of programming, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach audiences because the British people knew less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer to be criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and has no particular character?
Lordi Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, which starred Paloma Faith and Boy George, had been produced 'in the style of the BBC'.
He added that he wanted the production company to 'find success from inside its own house' the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to block the production of future seasons of The Voice or to order that the money paid by the licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales were at their lowest in August, possibly due to Black Friday.
The Commission has not received any comments from interested parties.
Last month's increase was the lowest since the beginning of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday may curb consumption
The growth of online shopping has been rapid for over a decade, transforming many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of a leveling off in online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August was at its lowest since the beginning of the year 2000: only 5% higher than last year.
Experts say there are signs of a leveling off in online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
'Looking back at growth levels in previous years and going back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time', Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could do so in different environments, like the couch.
But now it's flattening out, and it can be lowered.
The American phenomenon of Black Friday has been cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.
Experts believe that consumers will be reluctant to make purchases before the event on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers swarmed their computers to pick up their purchases, knocking down many of the merchants' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which has led shoppers to argue over the finds, may curb purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains in shopping streets.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca lifting accident, consequences for Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has blamed the collapse on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the hoist fell
29 dead were carried across the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, killed when a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Mourners, dressed mostly in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to the burial ground of Al-Moaissem.
A sad procession passed by a holy site where just a few days ago a hoist fell through the roof of a mosque, knocking down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king blamed the bin Laden family construction company for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
After the death of a man who had fallen from a lifting basket in the Grand Mosque of Mecca , the bodies of 29 worshippers were carried through the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, in the Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the lift collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already vowed that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Saudi Press Agency, run by the state, published an Arabic version of the decision saying that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it did say that the company's executives were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the fall of the lifting curtains in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any press release on the collapse of the discipline, nor has its representative been reached for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the association of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Grand Mosque of Mecca is surrounded by dozens of lifting towers, part of a huge construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, and they are leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy who was disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must make at least once in their lives.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a one-million riyal (£174,000) payment to the relatives of the dead and to those permanently injured.
The other injured will get half of this.
B&Q boss says Eastern European blue-collar workers are behind the popularity
The UK is increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The increase in the number of professionals from Eastern Europe is due to the
As a result, 200 more Screwfix shops for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be giving up their hammers and paint pens and are preferring to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do house building work
It seems that if you're a handyman with a hammer or a stick to paint walls, you're in the minority these days.
The British are increasingly hiring help to do do the do-it-yourself-your-own-home-work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, the owner of the home-repair business, Veronique Laury, said the popularity was due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they were offering their services at ridiculous prices.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and to close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in stores are made by the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
She said that changes in population must be taken into account: there are more single-woman economies today, with more housework than before.
Laury said: 'The majority of our store staff are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women have a big role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK's top FTSE100 companies, and she has reorganised her management team to include an equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which the group is composed of exactly 50% women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women on the board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both revenues and sales for the six months after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp-mindedness of the SAK and other employee-owned unions began to weaken immediately and as a result the country is on a stand-down on Friday due to a widespread strike by workers.
A lot of people think that's when the rational comes in.
We'll ask if it's worth it to strike when things are going badly.
There's even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already signed up online to say they will not participate in the protest and will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to openly declare bankruptcy would have been political suicide for the little guy.
A million-member trade union, a few tens of thousands of people protesting, not for a moment, but it does give you something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone feels the movement's goals are theirs, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the tough decisions of the government can also be seen as a gift from heaven.
After years of seeming to run its course, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending the rights of the worker, in full view.
The government may thus be willing to consolidate the role of the labour movement, as union membership may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one thinks of the actions of the NGOs, it is absurd that the demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to fall, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would be on everyone's mind.
The University of Lappeenranta is facing a severe savings curse: 8.5 million is the target, 130 staff are to be reduced
The Lappeenranta University of Technology is embarking on a savings programme with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will initiate a staff-wide YT consultation with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means the reduction of about 130 employees.
The other activities are expected to save an additional two million.
The Commission has also concluded that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
This fiscal year, the university will run a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and the other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
"The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction of corporate funding on our university is very significant", says Anneli Pauli, the university's rector.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more muted, but now the reduction of the complementary funding is seen in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will start next Tuesday and will last for the six weeks prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants to join Finnish Railways
The owner of the bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yelle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in joining the Finnish railway.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is the transport of the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After the short-haul, we're on the long-haul.
Souter's already told me he's approached the DMV.
The Ministry of Transportation, according to Yle, welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Among other international companies, the interest in rail transport has been expressed by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe.
The Federal Reserve has to make decisions about interest rates.
The rest of the world will be watching from the sidelines as the US Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a Reuters survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who last week believed the central bank would raise rates now believe the situation is still unresolved and that rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the markets to be ready to raise, but the signs also show that they believe the odds are against it.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The Delta State University shooter left a note apologizing for his actions.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "regretful" for the first murder and hoped he could undo it, authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, say that a geography and social studies teacher at Delta State University, Dr. Lamb, called 911 at approximately 10:00 a.m.
Monday and told me that he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the caller that the police have to send officers to his home.
He said he had "kissed" his wife last night and also mentioned that there was "a cute dog" in the house who "does not bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell them.
Lamb didn't give any explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it back".
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when surrounded by police.
The university's president, William LaForge, said that to his knowledge there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "clearly there was something on Lamb's mind".
Officials said Tuesday that despite Monday's claims that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any "third party drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "a good person".
The couple split up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and her daughters were "the best of friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home on the Internet, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives sometime Monday to tell them that he wasn't going to prison.
When police caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over to the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb earned his doctorate in educational psychology from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to the university's online resume.
Stars That Lost Their Charm
The actress (left), pictured with her son Redmond (right), has had a rough couple of years.
In 2001 she was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009 her long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he's also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really does take its toll.
Manchester United 's Luke Shaw is out for months after a double-breaking injury .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
Even though the defender is in tears and out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hoping Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's unconscious tackle in the 15th minute after a 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into PSV's area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, this kid comes to Manchester United at 18, suffers through the difficulties, and then he plays brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it takes at least six months to have a double fracture, and he's not playing in the blockade.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian agent was wrong.
You can judge for yourselves when I say it was a penalty and a red card.
That was a really bad two-legged fight.
Shaw tweeted: Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to express how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I will come back stronger.

The English defender will have an extra boost to his recovery at the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a really bad injury.
When a player is out because of an injury like this, everybody is very sad.
Our players never intend to offend the opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's team Van Gaal against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this very hard because the goal is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing", Cocu said.
I didn't see that.
The only thing I saw was the ball going in different directions, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado, of the PSV, was also taken to the hospital after being summoned by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better than this, right?
One thing every parent will soon learn is that if your child loves a book, it will not be long before he or she learns it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you are David Cameron.
When a child-care provider asked the Prime Minister for his favourite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax, a 1971 environmental story.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a post on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a strong message, I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we haven't seen before".
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, which, in addition to the rather short original text, had new characters and details added.
In the walled town of Tarvillen, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the real tree. The lyrics tell and describe a love story that was not written by Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds, in places, as if it were taken from a plot summary of the film Lorax found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the town of Tarville within the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win his dreams for the heart of Audrey girl".
Given Cameron's publicly active parenting, it seems unlikely that he would be so uninformed about the plot of the book, in which a young, unnamed boy hears how local wildlife has been destroyed by the greedy, wood-chopping, need-chewing Kerskanen, oblivious to the short, mustachioed creature that gave the story its name, the Lorax, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is likely to be outsourced to an assistant who has apparently never read a book to a child 20 times in a row.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it was still a tough place.
Playing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but seeing the team England have selected for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the 3-0 loss last time around will be repeated.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but it has good riders and a strong team mindset: they have no 2012 scars, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in his rotation duties and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, though an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England cricket team, to be replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandably difficult to analyse for me, as I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged by their performance.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the selection of Joe Root before the announcement, because, as I have said before, the players are the best selectors.
A hundred points or so more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come along.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he wasn't performing as well as he could have, and that doesn't surprise me, because Lyth is a team player first and foremost.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes for a hit to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected to the All-State team seven times, as was Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got to play both home and away.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in peak condition, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and there's a hitter I admire.
He has that something as a cricketer that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the UAE.
There's been some talk about Moeen opening the batting for Cook, getting an extra pitcher on the mound, but then getting four fastballs, and I'm not opposed to that.
I don't see why a batsman couldn't hit there, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his duty in his county of Worcestershire, but he's a triple for them, and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first tier before moving to the open in 2001.
He scored 300 points straight away and didn't dwell on the past.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup, and, given the little I've had to do with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People might look at his unadorned stats -- batting average of 31, with a .35-yard field goal -- and think it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers on the field, and the selectors picked the young ones.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside of the squad, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the games may prove to be a brilliant move.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings with him a tremendous amount of experience, having done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball games, bringing with him both energy and ruthless ferocity.
I always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of intelligence that Mahela has.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Collys Durham teammate Ben Stokes is resting on the ODIs, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this one.
Even if you don't agree with everyone, coaches and selectors don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
You never make decisions like this on the spur of the moment.
Brexiters could win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing bigger problems by the day, even if one ignores the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" question of Corbyn's election as Labour leader or the anger of the trade union central organisation over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragen.
A European diplomat friend recently explained that because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are fed up with Britain's egocentric agenda, which is full of divisive concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these states don't want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Council of Trade Unions decided that they too would not want them if they were to undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument with or without a local eye-witness, and then come home saying they are winning supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards at the inside of the EU tent in Britain - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say in Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care, and we leave.
The cautious and moderate German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it is ruined, as happened to the too long Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France faces reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's a fleeting force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the self-righteous, when their energy should rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend, some of these ministers may even be planning to make a deliberately useless remark in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiation was a set-up and the renegotiation had no significance for Britain.
Europeans have had a hard time experiencing how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-skeptic the press autocrats are, which they were not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing 'EU straight bananas' when he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a vast number of tax evaders, foreigners hacking phones, and persons nominally resident abroad who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a ravenous gorilla, you have to give up bananas for the sake of convenience, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and then later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair-like than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's renegotiation drive, having agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday (I told him he had no time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-adopting the 1980s boycott of Neil Kinnock's Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
And while it may take time, he's going to have to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr, whose BBC anchor Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the UKIP war painting scene and the more extreme nationalist Conservative Party can certainly support this view.
Hilary Benn, but not a Benn-fan, Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when her inner-school crusader wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice of hard-liner John McDonnell as shadow Treasury minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his godfather would be on TV trying to be disloyal to Labour Party government colleagues without going so far as to lose his cabinet post.
Hilary's veneers were more attractive.
But the fight to stay in the 'whatever the situation' - Benni's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the MPs and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the un-hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is a fertile breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron an air ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental twist on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-like regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in academic quarrels.
As for his divisiveness with NATO (Tom Watson is now convinced that Corby is not campaigning to quit), foreign diplomats have only to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the UK's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday at the opening of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the estimate of e-cigarettes by Public Health England
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than conventional cigarettes was based on a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tobacco industry.
The experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with the Lancet's criticism of the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released this 'milestone' report last month, describing it as a 'comprehensive review of the evidence'.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and have pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal The Lancet published an editorial last month attacking the "exceptionally weak" basis of the PHE's conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims are "built on rock or on sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: 'The main principle of public health is that practices should be based on proven effectiveness.'
They say that the public's expectation that PHE's claim 'the current best estimate of e-cigarettes is about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes' is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their views on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in a study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health mandates in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was told he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report receiving funding from the industry in the study.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco for the PHE.
The study produced by the group "very much acknowledges that there is a lack of unquestioned evidence of harm in most products and most criteria", write McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claim that 'there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers' is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the BMJ claims have been answered before.
He says: "Electric cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking".
Half of all people who smoke in their lifetime die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially with so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die every year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the harms of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice and that commercial competitors would 'give anything' for hits such as this soap on Albert Square.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to produce programmes that other British broadcasters do not produce.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have smaller audiences, on the airwaves against the more popular programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, but to no avail.
'I don't understand the idea of the BBC producing and broadcasting programmes that would be suitable for clearly unsubsidised competitors', Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is to be maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long term - it should at least limit its output to programmes that others do not produce.
The Voice is broadcast at the most important time, because we want to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: 'I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes which could be funded without state aid.
The Voice is one of those, and EastEnders is another, but it's definitely an inside job.
To be honest, the other channels would give anything for it.
I don't see how that's a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in any way.
Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of 'hunting audiences' because of the ambitions of people working on the show and because they believe it is the best way to win long-term support.
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Mr Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes were going to BBC4, where they often cannot measure viewership, but the BBC was fulfilling its responsibilities and then, in defending its £4 billion licence revenue, could hypocritically say that 'of course we are making all these unknown programmes that nobody watches'.
They put them in a place where no one ever comes to see them.
On the issue of license fees, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most out of it.
Now, of course you all think, we all think, that £150 a year is a lot of money, but I don't know if that's true for people who think £150 is a lot of money, because they don't use the BBC very much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its role in the Reith era of "informing, educating and entertaining".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output was now classed as education - he said the figures were 1 per cent of TV output and 0.1 per cent of radio - and that it should take the example of Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and transform its mission into 'to inform, to enlighten and to entertain'.
As for partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which he said are only shown on television all the time, and partner with commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
Emo-genetics allows control of brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the shuttlecraft shifts direction as soon as a sound pulse hits it.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically engineered nervous systems to be controlled by sound waves.
The tiny shuttlecock changes direction as soon as it is struck by a sound pulse too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically engineered motor cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the worms demonstrate the viability of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are directed into the brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttles normally don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic bubbles, things changed.
He found that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, says a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasonically guided shuttle worms, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms to have TRP-4 ion channels in part of their motile cells.
When Chalasani used ultrasound to mold the carpets, the microbeads amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the carpets, where they attached the molded motor neurons.
This method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that must be sent along an optical fiber to a desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound can travel through tissue unimpeded, so it can be sent to the brain from above the skull.
'We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus it may be possible to make targeted human nerve cells momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting,' Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
The ads are a disgrace to the British arms trade .
Watch the video of Amnesty International against the masses.
The most terrifying killing machines!
Carts that crush your ankles!
The shrapnel bombs!
And electrical stunning pumps that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful tone and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest gun fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to oppressive governments at a party at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in London's Teak District.

A separate campaign also saw the appearance of many posters at bus and subway stops, which require further study.
Important information, Will you be travelling on the DLR routes from 15 to 18 September? combined with the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR's track becomes a tank image.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR routes... and customers are being asked to help stop the shootings.
These 300 posters are the work of artists whose works were exhibited in Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound pack of wax keys that the collective claimed "give you access to a third of the planet's bus stop advertising space".
Transport for London has not been amused by this unauthorized "public vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political works to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in the resistance movement, when they realized that they had to go outside if they wanted their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun billboard greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours, created for free by the free advertising agency VCCP, and also by a graphic designer and a sound designer who worked for free.
Matt Leverin, the creative director of VCCP, noticed that the gun show was not advertised at all - and there was also a blank spot on ExCeL's calendar - and he thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic corporate publicity for the shadowy corporation, but the arresting voice emphasizes the point with bright colors and animation.
'They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at fairs,' said Amnesty's Tom Davies.
Now the UK government must take action to ensure that no torture equipment is illegally sold near our homes.
Perhaps the most creative art for the stands comes from inside Excel, with exhibitors trading in fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that it received a request from the US military for a "head-fired" AT4CS RS.
This includes a unique tube-fighting gun that delivers excellent effects to the target behind the armour.
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student residence
It's been 11 years since I moved into a dorm at 19 without knowing it, and I still believed in barrette and moral relativism, but I remember now the people I annoyed with their laughing and the many, many long complaints.
A lot of what I've learned can be summed up in these eight simple rules.
Moving into a flat can be anything from nerve-wracking to downright scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, whether you've had a gap year and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why I don't really love or hate Marmite because it's really just a hoot HAHAHAHAHA to find me in my room.
Just take a breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the people you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelids are on fire and they're handing out extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often become cocktail bars, movie theaters, and general entertainment venues, but they are also the places where people dress and mend their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college while you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of rest, but in many dormitories, a culture of room-to-room walking is formed that is friendly, social, and leads to lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell for someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you must leave now so I can recover the energy I've spent talking to you".
Try to sense when a student is tired of socializing and maybe text a friend instead of knocking.
When it came to knocking, knock.
There was this guy in my dorm who thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty cool stuff.
You make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college in the height of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate chip cookie tray and introducing yourself seems somewhat less weird, less "welcome to the neighborhood", I baked you something, now with a smile, when I ask you personal questions from a 50-year-old.
Serving up a delicious treat is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk, and they may in time associate your face with a tasty surprise.
I suppose this depends on how good you are at baking.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat-supplements are likely to make people only pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you take only a drop of milk with your tea?
Ask the milk owner and check.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even though they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and I sympathize with that, but try to be a little more mature than my roommate, who mixed laundry detergent in her milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You don't want to make a lot of noise so people can't sleep or study.
Not just because you're a decent person, but because you're like the proverbial pot calling the kettle black.
The girl in the hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn her drum and bass music down a bit, because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five o'clock, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before she put on her own music, locked her door, and left for the three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your roommate as your future spouse, you hooked up, you broke up, and then you saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot roommate really isn't your future spouse, you might as well try to reason with your little head.
In that exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their key in their unlocked room, the line between teasing and teasing is thinner than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it's instantly undoable.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer, but do not attach their property with blue tape to the ceiling more than twice at most.
Racist attack on the hostel of foreign students in Kittel - a building planned as a reception centre was blown up in Salò
A racist attack on a hostel for foreign students was carried out on Saturday morning in Kitea, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police had previously said, these are not the accommodation facilities for underage asylum seekers, but the dormitory facilities for foreign students who have already been in Finland for a longer period of time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical Folk School in Kitee.
The windows and walls of the dormitory of the Folk University were smeared with racist signs, such as cross-hatching, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one dormitory, according to the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, who is a teacher of social responsibility at the Kansanopisto, there were about ten people in the building that was the target of the violence at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults were free to move around, so some could be elsewhere", says Luukkainen.
The national university houses people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have already been in Finland for a while and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the building that was messed up has a-statuses.
Some of them are in adult education, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish", says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an accident and a breach of the peace of the home.
According to Luukkainen, the students were given information about the incident on Monday, and the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one has ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for a dozen years, and this is the first time something like this has happened", Luukkainen says.
The window says the mess has already been cleaned off the walls.
The suspects were at least three men, and they were driving a white car.
I think this is the highlight of the youth weekend, now that this topic has been brought up.
Nothing more serious than that", says the Squirrel.
There is also a hospital in the hall, with a reception centre planned.
It happened last week.
MTV reported on their website Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English, "You are not welcome".
The police have been notified of the crime.
Correction 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y-train to Karja, with passengers "totally idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karja will stop running in March.
The news infuriated passengers on the first train to the first stop at Helsinki's main railway station.
The lower river in particular is hitting the people of Siun", said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic, because the population is constantly growing and the working population needs a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can only be due to political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he will come to the capital city on a tractor.
The rest of the country is also changing trains.
The H and R trains running on the track will be combined into a new R line.
The station at Järvenpää and the Nuppulinna in Tuusulas will be closed.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR on Tuesday published information on which routes the Ministry will buy train services from for the next contract period.
The contract period changes every year, and there are routes to be canceled all over the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs at a later date.
The state railway company is a short-sighted operation, says Siuntian Bengtström.
They make the same mistakes that they've made in the past and they repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then you'll have regrets.
The Y-train is also used by non-Raasporans and Siunians, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Annina Pöyryä from Espoo was upset by the fate of those who traveled by train from the city area.
"It's especially bad for those who have to re-plan their trips", he said, aching for the Y-train.
I'm sure you'll be relieved.
A new railway connection is likely to be built along the coastal road, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. it will lead to Kirkkonummi.
This will result in additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
'We are now looking at the different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices,' said Suvi Rihtniemi, HSL's CEO.
It is not yet possible to estimate the exact costs.
Rihtniemi states that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately EUR 1 million per year for the Y-train, much more than the Ministry.
The R-line coming up the perimeter misses two stations.
The number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallioi will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed across the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase railway services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki lines.
The route Pieksäki-Joensuu is hereby shortened to Pieksäki-Varkaus.
The train services are reduced on the lines Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
The number of journeys made by the cancellable shifts is over half a million a year, compared with the total of some nine million journeys made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new contract is expected to bring the state an annual saving of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital in the Present: "Marx is worth studying"
The crisis in the world economy has brought to the fore Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his seminal work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Håkan, a former chairman of the SKP, in the book Marx's Capital in the Present.
"He is being taken more seriously than he has been in a long time", Hakanen writes in his opening remarks.
Marx's assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, its increasing internationalization and penetration of all spheres of life, its concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The author of a book based on the Capital Seminar organised by Mr Hakase is Professor Sixten Korkman, a renowned economist at Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is relevant "now and forever".
The former head of the Institute of Economic Research and the Commission for Economic Affairs is not a Marxist, is he?
No, not at all.
Korkman tells us on the phone that he does not consider Marx as a contemporary economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are diversified and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary scholar.
"The common perception is that the history of the nobility is about the wrong opinions of dead men", Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions were horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the beginnings of capitalism that went too far, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What is relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions", he says.
Now we're back to the Marxist debate on the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may perhaps provide inspiration for those who want to understand the big picture, the world changing as a result of technological revolution", Korkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is not going to help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's worth looking into.
"In the '70s, you couldn't read Marx", Korkman says.
"The Maoists and the Trotskyists and other sects all hate capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and it is also possible to approach Marx without the ideological and political weight of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with the world of Marx's thought - as well as with other classics", says Korkman.
The UN is demanding the trial of war criminals in Sri Lanka .
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war from 1983 to 2009 was released on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames war crimes on both the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tigers, the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers.
The Sri Lankan civil war is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
The number of casualties is also uncertain.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation of the major military offensive in the final months of a long war in 2009.
The report accuses Sri Lankan armed forces of torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, with men as likely as women to be victims.
The report says that the rebels have been guilty of forcing outsiders and children to fight.
Both sides are guilty of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the inquiry itself but will not allow the establishment of a UN tribunal because of foreign judges.
The British yo-yo test was a social media quiz.
The autumn student entries were in a long foreign language, predominantly English, on Wednesdays.
Over 16,000 people were tested for their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to ask ourselves if social media was making us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an article of 150 to 250 words in English could be directed to the editor of the online magazine.
It was called Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for Leelian's Finnish lounge chair.
He was asked how parents could view things in the same way as young people.
There were four subjects in total, and one had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest", says Mia Lybeck, an English teacher at the Swedish-language high school in Porvoo, on the third subject.
The third item contained only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject was, again, quite nice, according to Lybeck.
It was to write a keynote speech on why companies should hire young people for jobs.
"At least in our school, they have been practicing speech writing", says Lybeck, and he rates the whole experiment "almost normal".
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test asked you to answer questions on texts such as the adaptation of the summer camp to climate change and the handling of large data sets.
On Wednesdays, there was also some writing in Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn entries continue on Friday, when it is the turn of the other domestic, that is, the Swedish or Finnish test.
In high schools, the test is held as normal, so it is not affected by the demonstration of the employees.
The University Campus Review Board urges candidates to find suitable transport links in time to make it to the test site.
You can also be granted an extension of time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A store in Oulu was robbed at gunpoint .
A store in the suburb of Cello was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothing and a face-covering commando cap.
The man is of normal body and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and got a small amount of money as a reward.
It's being investigated as a grand larceny.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support groups from elsewhere in Finland
A demonstration against the government's budget cuts will block downtown Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
Preliminary estimates are that tens of thousands of people may attend.
The members of the SAK, AKAWA and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
The police on duty, on the other hand, are not only responsible for the emergency and other police activities but also for the protection of the public's feelings.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed to motor vehicles for approximately 9:30 to 2:00 a.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the Hakaniemi traffic circle, the traffic will be cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction from the Mannerheimin road.
Is the Helsinki police department well staffed, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, it seems to be enough.
I don't take sides in police work.
Kujala says that support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki to protest.
The police won't give us the exact number.
"There's a bit coming, but as a rule we're on our own", Kujala says.
Police advise to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jams will be from Hakaneema to the center of the city.
Traffic is expected to be stationary from this morning until the early hours of the morning.
With the arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland, a lot of special-purpose buses are coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed on the railway.
The buses will be delayed for a while.
The last thing to do is to walk to the protest site", Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's perspective, there's a silver lining.
The issue of the smooth running of mass transportation, which is normally on hand at these large gatherings of the people, now takes care of itself in part.
The organisers of the rally have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policies may be coming to Helsinki.
Police are waiting for the demonstration to go peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary people, employed or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,' says Kujala.
There are also local demonstrations across Finland on Fridays.
The Friday demonstration is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organized by the unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no good reference in Finnish political history, says Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä, Martti Siisiäinen.
It's no wonder the ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisiäinen says.
The right-wing government has attacked the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough-guy approach is not in keeping with the law of contract.
There are many features here that the AI movement is really trying to get down to its knees.
The same ay movement has a place for looking in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the labour movement does not have the support of all employees for demonstrations on Fridays.
What is new is the sharp division that the demonstration creates among the people whom the ay movement would like to join the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament in November 1993.
If one is looking for a reference point for the Friday demonstration, it could be the unemployed's waste-disposal demonstration, Murrostorstai, held in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the midst of the deepest of the lamas, the organized Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Aho (Central) government is sliding from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employers' organizations had never been so bad as during the Ahon bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is perhaps even worse than it was during the Murrostorstai period.
The EU is also the world's largest exporter of goods and services.
The current governing coalition is still interesting in that it is so right-wing despite what the Finns are saying.
There were still some elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to gather on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close day care centers and schools.
Even if the demonstration doesn't receive unprecedented support from the wage-earners, it could be the biggest one in years.
In recent years, Helsinki has seen some 300 demonstrations a year.
There's a lot of them.
Traditionally, the Finnish labour movement has been quite peaceful in its demonstrations - although the methods of action have become hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, in a Finnish protest, you avoid conflict, you obey the law.
Protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiäinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of showing off has changed.
The EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared to get their heads full of pig shit.
The firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998.
There were also demonstrations by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember those strikes and demonstrations?
The metal and electricity strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
The Metallists' strike was joined by 70,000 Metallists.
The strike was called off by the Conciliation Commission after seven weeks.
The metalworkers got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, a blackout lasted 49 days, causing power outages across the country.
The breakthrough came in 1993
On November 4, 1993, some 20,000 people, many of them unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the Parliament building to express their support for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in ' 98 .
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest nationwide.
Farmers against the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in a chickenpox during the farmers' anti-EU protests in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, EU stops", was one of the slogans.
Farmers in Espalle were shoving tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led to farmers protesting and burning haystacks in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in '83 and '95 .
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
Threatened to strike and mass exodus of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dissent accelerated the negotiations to a final result.
The doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - compulsion", was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health and hospital doctors lasted five months and generated a lively debate on how strikes could jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
In 2013, about 5,000 students marched from Senate Square to the Parliament Building in Helsinki in support of student aid.
Central Crime Police investigates the background of the Finnish refugee camp for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee who has been registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the ice were all in good shape.
We've been exchanging information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the scene in Austria, says the Chief Inspector of the Central Crime Police, Tero Haapala.
In late August, other refugees in a truck in Austria suffered a more dire fate.
All 71 passengers on board apparently died of suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported on the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish joint stock company.
The company is, among other things, a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a down-on-his-luck businessman - the story of five smugglers
The king of the smugglers, the violent Venetian, the missionary with style, and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people are involved in the trafficking of human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of Trento University and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book Death's Travelogue is being published this week.
In the book, they present the scourge of human trafficking, propose solutions and present the traffickers from different angles of the business.
H.S. is presenting five of them.
I 'll knock their brains out right now .
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia are not a popular destination for foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
Because of their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 75 miles [120 km] away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attayan, lives Emir, a chained captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
Which is what the Emir has done on his blue, ten-meter wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
Emir's earning about 8,000 euros after expenses per trip.
The Emir has five assistants who find him clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, things calmed down until the refugee crisis erupted again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is given in such a way that the customers can barely survive.
The cost of accommodation is about 75 euros per night, and if the client runs out of money, that is their problem.
We'll take the boat at midnight, with the lights out.
The first night, we drive off the islands, then we stop, wait for daylight, and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves as high as 60 feet [20 m], passengers cry and vomit.
The human cargo will be unloaded at the destination in half an hour and Emir will be on his way back.
The Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least he claims he beats the shit out of the stalkers.
In the book, he relates that when he was once stopped by a policeman, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I would rip the customers' necks off one by one and throw them overboard", Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travellers come from the sub-Saharan region.
I hear his fellow countrymen are gonna have to beat him up for this.
I'll knock their brains out.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a cab driver
Goran is just a regular cab driver in Bogovac, Serbia.
His cab is not very good, the engine is running out of gas, and he's seen his best days.
But the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving, and it's moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village and is mainly used for families.
In the forests surrounding the center, men traveling without their families stay in tents, huts, and abandoned cars, whatever anyone has managed to find or build.
The forest is also home to families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some of them are staying in private apartments, but that's a public secret.
Among the Mets, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a great number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovanda area, the hub of a major human trafficking operation, the people are exhausted to death.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their piece once and that's it", Goran boasts.
He says the Africans are trying to take over.
Goran doesn't like that.
Stupid, stupid, stupid the whole way.
First they agree on a price, say 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 euros, and finally they offer 150.
Goran insists he's a nice man with a good heart.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", she says in the book.
Goran says he works for less than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's a thousand miles, mostly on the freeway.
I hear the colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns around 50,000 euros a year.
It's not much for a smuggler, but it's a nice yearly income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis cannot carry migrants within 12 kilometers of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the back roads and he takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and he's gone.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is visited by many of his fellow believers who have fled Congo, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business, moving people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a charity work.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of his white underwear sticks out gracefully below the low waistline of his jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary is not preaching, he is organizing people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the five numbers in the Mission.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money well and hide it among the merchants crossing the border.
To be granted refugee or asylum status, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from, for example, the war-torn areas of Northern Kivu and that they have been forced to flee their homes because of violence.
Often, that's true, but if it's not, the Missionary will arrange for the client a new identity.
The old identity card is destroyed and replaced by a new one.
The missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police will help.
After that, the client is directed to the same place that real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, and finally the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy, having come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges for each step separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation costs about 150 euros, and the process of moving to, for example, a European country costs between 4,500 and 7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a rookie smuggler, former drug lord.
An Irishman in his 40s is stationed off the French coast at Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks bound for Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in the human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their customers, usually two or three people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom picks the right truck, makes sure it's headed for England, not Holland, and cuts the safety flap off the protective cover.
We have to do it quietly, so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the trick is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, the same type used in the kitchen to wrap a toast or an oven potato.
It should prevent the police from detecting a potential intruder with a thermal scanner.
Some use an ice-filled sleeping bag for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customer in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not hit the smugglers, at least not before Britannia.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human traffickers.
The Turkish pirate has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of Mediterranean illegal landings, controlling the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
He has been active since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury-ship scam: a purse is hired from Turkish ports to take American or European families on a few days' cruise to the seaside.
In reality, the ships are full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000 from Istanbul to a port on the Mediterranean and then to Europe by sea.
Customers are kept in human storage, such as in old industrial buildings, until it is time for them to leave.
They're cramming people into minibuses and driving them somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide in the bushes and wait for a signal.
When it's delivered, we need to get aboard quickly.
Passengers must remain under cover the entire journey.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink will be provided, but the fewer passengers who reach out and throw up, the better.
Küçük earns about €53,000 after expenses for a luxury cruise.
He does not handle the practical matters himself but hires captains, recruits, guards, lodgers and other smaller parties to do the work for him.
In the summer, there are hundreds of transportations, and Küçük makes millions.
He's bought land through front companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over 100 apartments that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 along with a member of parliament from the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
And then he disappeared.
The Death Travel Agency book is coming out this week, not next week.
In her book, an American Olympic runner describes her illness and her prostitution
Three-time Olympic runner Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has sparked a storm of interest in the United States.
In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells of how she ended her career and became a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career in Sydney for the Olympics.
He came into the race in top form and ran the second fastest time in the qualifiers.
But in the final, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right from the start and defended his lead with a frantic run.
But with 150 yards to go, his strength was gone.
He collapsed onto the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, says Favor Hamilton in her book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had done the Sydney Games a year before his suicide, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money by having sex with men he didn't know.
She also persuaded her husband to approve of her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was $450 an hour.
He's gonna tell me he spent the money on a life of luxury.
Favor Hamilton's explanation for becoming a prostitute was also that he craved the same adrenaline rushes he had received while competing in public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was in the 1500 metres with a world record time of 3.57.40, but finished last in the Olympic final in Sydney.
The world champion was delighted when the Norwegian skiing team disciplined him: "Right-handed"
Norway's skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the line of fitness, according to at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been at odds all summer and autumn over the sports agreement.
Although the NFL has offered Northhug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was praised by double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski pole in order.
"Thank you for showing your back", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a federation sponsor", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the national team for a season so he can advertise his sponsorship.
Mr Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also cares for future generations and does not let one athlete down.
The Commission has already submitted a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb will not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than others just because he is the best.
Northug published a statement on Tuesday, in which he said he wanted to play for Norway in the next World Cup and then in the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals, two of them gold.
He was on the team that won the gold medal at Falun last winter.
Turtle Day is also celebrated in the Nordic countries
On the 25th of September, the day of the shield, there will be a raffle in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the shield of the Translator of the Sword.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of Finnish food know-how and to lower the threshold for leaving a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the sign as part of high quality.
At the same time, it should be noted that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but there are some top restaurants throughout Finland, which have been inspected and classified by an independent operator.
The international attention the event has received is a testament to the importance of the event as part of raising awareness of the organization and the sporting clubs.
In the north, the day is organized in Vaasa, a restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarellis.
The Old Town Restaurant is participating in the Kokkola Shield Day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event is to become one of the organisation's most important international events, taking place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: advocates for the establishment of a terrible reception centre
The Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a Refugee Reception Centre on the premises of the former Kauhava garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still occupied by critical infrastructure of a crisis-type nature, which is in use by the defence forces and its partner, Finnish Special Networks Ltd.
According to the Kauhajoki newspaper, the private person believes that the placement of the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant claims that the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former flight school and the airport, the impact of which has not been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that for the last two years negotiations have been taking place for the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at Kauhava airport.
The matter has been discussed with, among others, the Minister of Defence, Jussi Niinistö (PS) and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rady.
The private party explains to the legal counsel that the complaint is not about the reception centre's opposition in principle, but about the incorrectness of the planned location in the former garrison area.
The city of dreadful had a reception center case last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Commission is also proposing that the EU should be able to take action to ensure that the EU's citizens are not subject to discrimination.
The President said that the concern about the management of the refugee situation united all those involved.
He said he was grateful that the government and opposition parties in Finland were able to discuss fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region could also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
The situation is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tensions in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also sidelined in the talks.
The president's not taking a position on the labor market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, starts with a two-hour delay
One flight canceled already on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights is available on the Finnair website.
Finavia reports that the airport's operations are managed by a supervisory authority during the stoppage.
However, traffic and delays are to be expected for security checks and other service points.
The protest closes the streets of downtown Helsinki
A demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of downtown Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the railway station will be closed to cars from about 9:30 to 14:00.
From the mainland, cars are not allowed to go to the Kaivakattu, Postkattu or Töölönlahden gates in the direction of the railway station.
From Union Street to Hakaneemi, traffic is diverted to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
Police say the closing time will depend on the number of people attending the protest.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and train drivers at the Friday protest
The drivers of the subway and tram will participate in the demonstration on Friday from morning traffic to night traffic.
The National Association of Radio and Metro Employees told the STT about the incident last night.
Most of the stations will be closed for two hours, including the post office.
Friday's protest is also causing disruption to Postal services.
Significant delays are expected in the delivery of daily mail, among other things.
Most of the main post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transfusions are being carried out despite the strike.
Food transportation, hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also being handled.
The current state of the services can be found on the Post website.
Most of the Alko shops in Finland close their doors for two hours on Fridays.
Pam, the service trade union, has instructed its employees to stop working between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also called on the day-to-day shop workers to join the trade union demonstration.
Representatives of the Social Security and Kesko told the Helsinki Sanom that they will try to keep the stores open, if necessary, with the help of the management.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual shops.
Helsinki day care partially closed
The Helsinki day care centres are not fully operational on Fridays, according to the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency.
In view of the concerns expressed by the professional associations, day care may be concentrated on specific kindergartens and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds may not be organised.
Day nurseries, which are open 24 hours a day, and groups for children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for pupils with disabilities and autism are organised as normal.
The Early Childhood Education Agency will be in touch with any changes in the program tomorrow.
Media researcher: The chicken takes a big risk
According to Sipil, communication requires multiple channels, and the prime minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
We also need a channel of this kind in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in the parliament.
The Commission has not yet decided how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be broadcast.
Frog says that talks may not always be broadcast on the Upper Channels in the future.
If other channels sign up for it, we'll see.
Now, tonight, we're gonna use this channel, the Owl said.
According to the report, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
The whole of the matter we are discussing is rather complex and requires a lengthy argument.
That's why we ended up in this canal, Octopus survived.
The speech will be broadcast at 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the Yale Arena.
The frog takes a big risk
The media analyst hopes that the Owl's televised speech does not indicate a more general government turnaround.
Is the aim to take the right to define public debate more firmly into one's own hands and to refuse to set the issues of public debate?
I am reminded of Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin's recent comment about not following the media agenda and not letting it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these things are not related.
The committee understands that the commercial media is disgusted with the announcement of the dragonfly.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political leaders are not matters of publicity in a democracy.
The media representatives are, by definition, responsible for ensuring that the agendas of politicians are not taken for granted.
Koivus says that a televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
The ant should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the unusually high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more to the story we've heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same, one has to wonder why such a great gesture was made and why Yle gave it exceptional time.
I am not going to go into the details of the procedure, but I would like to ask you whether you would like to see the Commission's proposals put forward.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a message from politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in Yellen's interests or the general line.
The trick of the spider
The media analyst stresses that what the Prime Minister does not say is also important in the future speech of the owl.
The European Commission has published a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
According to the newspaper, the TV speech is a clever move by Sipilä, because this way he can bring his own point of view without any noise.
This allows the message to reach a large audience without the filter of the journalist, unlike the press conference, where the journalists can ask critical questions.
The Eagle will bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
But there is a danger that the media will misinterpret the speech because they will not be allowed to ask specific questions.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV - does he sweat, does his hand tremble.
He compares the Owl to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If the Gull can make a good point, it might work.
This is different from the situation if the government were to ask about something, because here it is as if one person were talking directly to another.
This is something that [US President Barack] Obama and his partners do regularly.
It 's really extraordinary .
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the people to be truly exceptional.
He said that in decades, there had been no such thing as a Prime Minister speaking directly to the people.
"Exceptional times call for extraordinary means", Railo says.
The researcher suspects that the Prime Minister is trying to make the Finnish people sympathetic to the upcoming extortion.
The employers' organizations are organizing a demonstration and strike against the government's actions on Friday.
The chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
The SDP chairman Antti Rinne (Sd.) has announced that he will challenge the Sipilä dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Almost six months before the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy who had been on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department will also confirm this to Iltalehd.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer heard from.
Dad thanks all the people who helped him find it.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible amount in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed with violent rage of young people: You cause anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish volunteer, posted a video on Facebook appealing specifically to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a powerful speech against the street battles of the youth.
Born in Iran and moved to Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been uploaded videos of young people fighting in extremely violent ways.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the young people's wildness.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You kick the ones on the ground, sit on top of each other and punch without thinking about the consequences, which will be the consequences when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It 's hard to defend now .
Some of the young people in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and local Finnish youth.
The fact that you're fighting in the street.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, Amirkhani reminds us.
Amirkhani reminds me that in Finland there are websites that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated incidents have become quite a lot.
Kind of hard, boys, defending you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign land and will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever come under the spell of some kind of racism, you can blame yourself.
You guys think twice before you go down that road.
Amirkhani says that violent actions give rise to racism.
You're causing me a kind of anger that I don't like myself.
You're in a bad place, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
The SAK is pledging its stance on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employers' association would consider its position on the alternative savings scheme proposed by the STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The trade union organisation STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity target demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind it.
However, this would require the largest employer organisation, SAK, to soften its earlier position.
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, tweeted a low-key comment.
Lyly writes that the SEC's working committee will be hearing the case on Monday.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of social security contributions to the social security system.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of Prime Minister Sipilä's government for a partnership agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
Sipilä had earlier broken off negotiations on the partnership agreement when SAK did not agree to commit to the 5% productivity gap target.
Comment: The big show is about to come - "It feels a little funny to be a fist in a tree"
It's a little awkward to punch someone with a piece of paper in your pocket.
The hours in the mercenary camp vary from lazy to lazy.
Is the point to shout down the government or at least make peace with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK Alliance unleashed a holy rage against the Republican government.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The flea was spreading.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no schools or day care centers will be shut down completely.
The President of the Staff Centre, Antti Palola (sd), was heard in conciliatory terms.
He said he had contacted the government and was preparing the alternative proposal for a 5% productivity gap, which was being put forward by Prime Minister Juha Sipila (Central).
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder (kok), hastened to announce that his draft document had been completed.
At first, the SAK office was not a big deal.
The President of the European Parliament, Lauri Lylyn (SD), said that it was difficult to reach an agreement after the leaders of the alliance had just announced on Monday that the country would be put on hold on Friday.
But finally, Lyly announced that the SAK's working committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to "open the door to the labour market".
In order to achieve a common proposal by the employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity gap as a target.
No wonder the Palolan S.T.A.C. has a good relationship with the Goblin government.
The right hand of Palol, Jukka Ihanus, the director of social mediation at STTK, previously worked as a special adviser to the Centre's Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The Commission's role is to ensure that the EU is able to play a role in the development of the EU's energy policy.
The excretion of the Palolla took a little bit of the air out of the Finnish standings, with the lead vocals of the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
It's a little weird to be punching someone if you already have a paper towel in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00: Added information about Lilly's comments.
Russia accused Finland of being a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki ETSI meeting.
The Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is a better host for the Soviet Union than Finland.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'external trade' in the context of the common agricultural policy.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he was also denied entry.
The sanctions are political suicide by the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia got in without a hitch, so Naryshkin continued to sneer at Finland by praising and complimenting Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am confident that the Parliamentary Assembly will be constructive and produce the most positive results - unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin met with the head of the Ulaanbaatar meeting, Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who according to Russian media has already held talks with the Russian delegation.
The Cubs face off against the real playoff troll, "Goals in the Tight".
Tappara and Lukko continue their bullfight in the Haak Forest today, as they both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real goal celebrations in Hakamets today.
Tappara was at Kuopio yesterday, scoring a 3-2 away win for KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its lowest with two goals from scratch.
Tuesday night was a lot more fun than Tuesday night.
The Rauma's prize, as the Blues's guest, was a round of zero points, and the losing teams were also 2-3.
Tough game, goals in the net, if they play anything like last year, Lukko striker Janne Lahti predicts setups on the club's website.
The killer has become a playoff nightmare for the Rauma.
Tappara has been in the final two seasons, in the second half, just knocked out of the final by Luka.
Both times, the final seventh match is required to decide.
Last season, Lukko led the series to a fourth-place finish, but Tappara moved up to third in the next three games and missed.
There are no major changes in the lineup of the teams, except for the goalkeepers.
The cashiers of both the companies who were rejected yesterday will be given a top-shelf today.
With the painting of Tappara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lukko-tops, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: A Lousy Play in the Making
The director of sport Toivola wrote a script for a sequel that was not suitable for the head coach Rautakalliö, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdog has sensationally put the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, in the ring.
Rocky was a huge hit, even though he lost the title fight.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a restless story of ashes for Pori.
The nameless, wooden-handled pat-pack made it to the 2006 World Series finals, much to everyone's surprise.
The team was full of anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Peltos.
In the playoffs, players would dye their heads red and cut their foreheads.
The hope turned into a blonde.
The famous TV scout J.P. Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter, Toivola, believes that this season's new play will work the same way it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the head athletic director for the Aces has built a batting cage on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been shoving their heads in the back of the truck like Rocky's been shoving pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masijamäen, Mikko Viitas, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are not only good at playing on the disc.
What Toivola forgot is that Rocky VI stars Pekka Ironclad.
Karri Stone has crossed Iron Man to Sean Connery.
The Iron Thorn is as clumsy a lead actor in Rocky as Connery would have been in the original 1976 script.
There's nothing in the iron tray but the nickname "Rocky".
The game philosophy of the Iron Man is not to rush and poke around.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces took out Tappara Jere Karjalaist with a header.
He got the judges to give him two minutes and ten seconds, but the Iron Man put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play the ones who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not in the game of hockey, and the hot-blooded Iron-Blade went after the game to the Nation of Hundreds.
The A's have a strange build this season.
There are trains, veterans, police and whistle-blowers.
There are virtually no key players at the peak of their playing career.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about the lack of talent.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Iron Man?
The events of the last season affect the purchases and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather tight, the Iron Throne responded diplomatically.
There's a fire under the surface.
The 1953 Iron Throne is reportedly interested in moving to Toivolan as a sports car.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The three league games this season, the ace's score is equal to the number of losses by 1-6.
I don't think Toivolan should have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen is playing the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen will be directing her husband for the first time.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
It seems kind of crazy, and actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to former Apulanna bassist and director Tuukka Temmen since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but this is the first time Olga is acting in a Tuukan directed film.
The role of Olga in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulanna, is the mother of the drummer Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
The cricket is supportive of his son, even though his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my real role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become very close.
They've met, they've talked on the phone, they've texted.
The garlic has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles of their history.
And also, Sirkka, you're lucky to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become Finland's biggest band.
In the '90s, it was a recession, and it was really dark.
There was a pretty slim chance that anyone would actually succeed, but Circus had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
But the parents' stories have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know about what you're doing?
Olga reveals that her own youth was very different from that of Tuukan, known as the notorious skater of Heinola.
Olga was a nice, ordinary girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with the movie Tuuka.
At best, he could have secretly fallen for her.
Olga says that she has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that she's not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always gone super smoothly.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month of shooting.
The couple in the alley will, indeed, often drive their small children home at night because the distance is not too great.
We'll take over the whole of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a very warm welcome, just asking which streets and when they're going to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish feature film
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The shooting starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola is set to begin shooting Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive Finnish feature film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland was Jalmari Helander's Big Gamelle.
The Angry Birds animation, which is in the works, will also surpass Iron Sky 2 when it is completed, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will begin shooting in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola is going to Belgium next week.
A big budget is not a scarecrow.
I've been sick and tired!
I have this relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to be in Belgium.
Even though it's a tight time, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience", he tells Iltalehti.
The original budget for the film was $8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
Big budget, but big story too.
But I think a movie could be worth 100 million dollars because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything is so tightly twisted, there's no loose ends.
Film production company Iron Sky Universe today launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond issue that pays an annual interest rate of 4 to 8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will repay the loan in two years at the latest.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
The big logos are back on the shirts
The trendsetters' brows have been decorating the big logos lately.
Until recently, the fashion conscious dressmaker avoided the obvious and big logos like Crocs and his cousin.
Advertising a brand of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a juggernaut.
But they change.
Sportiness has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports car brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already pretty junk, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or tavis fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favoring the most dull underwear as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the gray basic collage, we'll be wearing the web-shaped shirt buried in the bottom of the closet, with the manufacturer's logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable track nets, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees jerseys have made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the skirts, which are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the collar of Versace's fall skirts makes it clear what brand of clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your clothing?
A Russian politician released evidence that I was not trapped in a tank hatch for hours!
The allegedly unusual incident took place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, showcasing products of the Russian military industry.
In recent days, Russian media have been flooded with colorful allegations that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to detach the Zotov, a large tank, from the hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he could to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page where he appears to be peering into the hull of an armored vehicle in quite good spirits and, at least from the pictures, there is no sign of any embarrassment or anger.
This is all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside a battle tank, it was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, a lieutenant colonel, I served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace", Zotov told Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov, a former professional soldier, explained to the Russian military television channel that he was delighted with the new Russian technology in the exhibition.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages, admiring our technology.
And I came out the back door, he said.
I've been in every tank.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all armoured fighting vehicles, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote it, and everyone else did it.
There was no such thing.
I went in, I came out.
I'm tall and I'm skinny, but nothing like being stuck in a tank happened, he told Russian radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged entrapment have been published, although the exhibition attracted a total of 50,000 visitors over a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's entrapment was first raised by a story on the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was reported to have been pushed out of the tank hatch while trying to get out, and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he did not get off the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers gave their own view of what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, in any case, said the coordinator of the exhibition, Aleksandr Pisarevski, to Bloknot.
This is the favorite item of all the interior bloggers.
The 1962 Lassen nail bed by architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks as if it were designed today.

The horoscope for the 16th of September 2015
You're trying some kind of endurance.
He's not a piece of paper, but you know he's not as hard as a rock.
You're alike in many things, including vitality.
You're wondering how things are going to go.
You have the strength and the will to make it happen.
It is also important to be kind to yourself and to others.
You are quick, but not so quick that you can make someone understand your position on the matter.
He's slow, and he doesn't want to be controlled, even by you.
I'm gonna shake hands with a guy, 'cause one thing is going forward.
There's no one way to approach it, but at least you know you have a common goal.
You've been taking a little measurement with someone.
But you are not competing in the traditional sense; you want to know what he or she really is like in dealing with his or her mate.
Your assumption is correct.
That's why it's good to bust your chests.
You have a chance to be in touch with someone today.
Do it, even if your time is on the card.
One of them is a very special person.
You'll only know when he opens his mouth.
The gestures and facial expressions also tell us a lot about the time before that.
Someone's upset with you.
You don't see anything extraordinary about the situation, but there's a lot of ambiguity in the air.
You know where you're going.

Your capacity for different tasks has grown over the years.

This conversation is not about to end.
It shows how interesting you are.
A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The process water that has been purified from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called richness pool into the ditch.
The company said that measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains enriched sulphur neutralised by the foaming process and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or is allowed to be discharged through the surface treatment field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
The company claims that the quality of the sewage is in line with the current permitting standards.
No other material was released into the environment.
The leak was discovered during a routine inspection on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been found to cause structural damage to the basal pathogenic structures.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danish Hole in the Wall: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish land balance sheet, which is being published today by the International Monetary Fund, is broadly in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms across Finland to cope with the economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid leave would support Finland's competitiveness.
The whole contractual system and unemployment insurance would need to be reformed.
Pasi Kuoppamanen, chief economist at Danske Bank, said there was a "green light" on structural reforms, but there were also "small differences".
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of pro-government messages, but also warnings about what should not be cut too much.
The Commission has already adopted a proposal for a regulation on the introduction of a single currency for the euro.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible, in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts Finland's economic growth at 0.4% this year, accelerating to 0.9% next year.
Danske today forecasted growth to be zero this year in its new ratio forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They could have been based on the latest observations.
This morning, the Statistics Office reported that total production was up slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki said.
The weakening of confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators may have been less noticed.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimal points.
Nintendo, recovering from a death, has appointed a new executive.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata had been running Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were being raised as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata's footprints, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research, to Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to bring Nintendo into the mobile game world, but not to eat the company's bread alongside traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
The Swedish Immigration Agency reports that hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year.
The immigration inspector Juha Kannelmaa tells us about the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same the case in Finland?
How many asylum seekers disappear underground every year? In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were submitted by unaccompanied minors in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The background to the disappearance may be that it is apparent during the proceedings that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been recognised as an adult there.
In such a case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the application.
A corresponding proportion of the missing persons are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were rejected on the grounds that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
- How much is it?
As of September 6th this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who came alone.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment and the environmentally sensitive products.
What happens to those who have been convicted?
Will they also disappear into, for example, the "dark market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of the removal orders, Kannelmaa stresses.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (chef) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered asylum seekers.
He's already taken action on the matter.
The EU's interior ministers discussed the issue of asylum at a meeting of EU ministers, and Orpo on Monday gave a presentation of practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A.'s studio on the Internet - look at the pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Mikos Mikosen for TV and radio productions is now on sale.
Mikkosen's wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net that was once the most advanced professional equipment in the field.
The first to report the online announcement was the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind by technological advances.
In the digital media world, you don't shoot TV shows on Betacam tapes anymore.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are people interested.
Of course, the hardware is not up to date in that way, but it is still needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and those who build their own studio, Nina Mikkonen reflects on IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are looking to move out of their current home in Stormwind.
There's no way we can take all this stuff with us.
I've been slowly starting to inventory and see what things are being given away.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no more home use for TV and radio equipment.
It is clear from recent strokes that the man who has had a long career will not return to the workforce.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now we only sell goods and equipment.
The actual life work of Timo T.A. Mikkos was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä by means of a box sale.
The worst-case scenario is that the subway and the tramway will be shut down for the entire day on Friday.
The subway and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend the use of force in Friday's protest.
The original plan was to stop the subway and the tramway only for the Friday demonstration.
In the afternoon, you decide if traffic will stop for the day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the chief of the trust, says that the Ufo is big on the field.
Night and daytime lane cuts are causing severe distress to drivers, so government plans to cut lanes are met with opposition.
But the monster thinks that stopping traffic for a whole day is a bit of a dilemma.
If the subway and tram services stop on Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area will be virtually at a standstill.
According to the VR, trains do not run on Fridays between 6am and 6pm.
Friday night, no short-distance or long-distance traffic.
Trains departing before 3 a.m. will be driven to their destination.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left behind.
The ACP members are out of work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
The number of buses that can be driven is likely to be small, and they will be driven by the driver's own power, HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo said.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus routes will be running on Friday.
The employers' organizations are organizing a big demonstration at the Helsinki railway station on Friday from 11 to 13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hundreds of refugees were attacked by Hungarian police with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News has reported that the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas . A teacher thought his homemade clock was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher used his homemade clock to bomb his school.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the proceeds of his electronics hobby.
But one of the teachers thought it looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention center.
Muhammad is never recorded as claiming anything other than that he had made the clock.
But there's still a chance that the boy could be charged with making a false statement.
Mohammed said that the police had found that the clock looked like a "movie bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohammedia was punished with three days of forced absence from school.
His father is furious about the case, and the American Muslim Council is wondering if this is another example of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is roaring - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
The song is a prayer to God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-leaning press has also been echoed by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the public, Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined in.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, Labour supports Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the speech was starred.
The election of Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party has divided the ranks of the Labour Party.
Especially amongst the MPs, there are those who fear that he will drive away moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of austerity and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to make his first appearance as party leader in Parliament today at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what questions to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was tweeting about Corbyn's election as party leader over the weekend.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted from his own account.
The cause of the Minnesotan family's death is still unclear. The father of the family was awaiting a court case.
South Lake Minnetonka police have just completed a week-long investigation into a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a couple of days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his home.
Dead for days .
The family was found after a school was concerned about the children's absence.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for a search and found the Short family dead on all sides of the huge house.
Star Tribune says it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful business
The investigation into the death of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloody acts is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur who had made his fortune on the social media site for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site has four million unique visitors each week.
I've had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
One of the successes was that in 2011 the Short family bought a huge house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the Zwisillo property website as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage with enough space for eight cars.
The case is pending
But according to the Star Tribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
He was sued by Achieve Test Prep, a company that offers a variety of pre-nursing courses, over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, comments defaming prep courses and courses were not removed from Short's website and, as a result, they lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me a cup of coffee.
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippo's Horse Owner of the Month prize.
This is great. Loiri's commentary is very good.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned €100,000.
The legendary artist Loiri was still baffled by Fabrice Duo's success in the Grand Prix.
I still can't believe that happened.
The coach of the successful horse, the Raven, is the one who gives Loire complete peace of mind when working with the horse.
The horse decides where the horse is to be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna keep my mouth shut, you little Loiri.
A stunning gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest donation by an athlete of all time"
Superstar P.K. Subban of the Montreal Canadiens has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital release, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charitable organization in Canada.
Furthermore, 26-year-old Subban has pledged to help the hospital raise funds for the next seven years.
Subban signed Canadiens a year ago for eight years and $72 million.
So Subban's donation is significantly greater than his $9 million annual salary.
In return for his donation, Subban will be given a hall named after him at the hospital.
Canadian players have made significant contributions to local hospitals in the past.
The longtime captain, Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another large hospital in the city, which was used to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a Japanese coffee at the wife's for dinner. She serves food in a bikini and a top.
Tea beans are a big deal in Japan.
Already there is a goat's coffee, a rabbit's coffee, a vampire's coffee, a shark's coffee, and now a wife's coffee.
It strikes those who are lonely, socially isolated and hungry.
Metro is reporting it.
At Ore no Yome (my wife's) in Tokyo, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "spouse" is chosen from a list before entering the café and prepares and serves the food.
The wife is wearing a tuxedo and a bikini, and the husband is wearing tight biking shorts.
The website provides all the information about height and weight for the couple, always on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: the attacks on car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a press release from Intel.
The board is made up of the world's top security experts.
The ASRB researchers will conduct continuous security testing and review to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future based on the ASRB's findings.
The international ICT research and consulting firm Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the grid.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road.
The same estimate suggests that between 60% and 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and distributing network-based data.
We can and we must improve cybersecurity in cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
The ASRB will enable Intel to establish best practices in safety and to support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
In Finland, the Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros!
The Ford Focus RS has been awaited for years like the rising moon.
Finally, the car is also starting to be seen in Finland.
Ford has released the RS data now that the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
With its 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, Ford's new four-cylinder RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 166 miles per hour.
The price is also interesting for the Finnish, and is initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for ordering, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
The brand's favourite Kia has unveiled two new cars at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
The most important of the two Finnish innovations is surely the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia is planning to take a bigger wing in the ever-growing street car market.
The new Sportage, designed by Gregory Guillaume, the European Design Director, is more rounded than before.
The wheelbase and the exterior are now a centimeter here, a centimeter there, and the car is breaking through the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially the same, but with the addition of a 1.6-liter turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
The amount of the Kia Sportag and its performance and consumption is reported as a proxy for the sales revenue.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we'll have a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the year was out, the new Kia Optima came to our country.
At first glance, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a brand new car.
Kia is set to win the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with even better driving performance, lower noise levels and a higher level of equipment.
The Optimus is equipped with a 1.7-litre turbo diesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the Optima GT, with its 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, joins them.
At the same time as its arrival, Optima Farma will be put on sale.
Chisu returned to the stables ... and fought in a daring and daring battle .
Chisu is performing at the Life for a Child concert with other local stars.
The blue-flecked trousers have a spectacular, wide-open neckline.
The resident is beautifully displaying the waistband of the singing star.
The crown of wholeness is a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
In the three years since becoming a mother, the singer has shed the pounds of her pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
Getting back in the saddle and standing up in front of a large audience after a long break doesn't really excite me.
"I've missed doing anything related to music", says the singer.
Chisu will release their fourth album in a few weeks, Polaris.
Your new life situation has inspired me to write some new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu is wondering.
Kim Kardashian's motherly style is stunning again. Now her breasts are showing.
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian is giving us one hot topic after another.
She's been showing off her pregnancy and breast implants in sexy outfits, most recently last night at 1:00 AM, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband, Kanye West, at a concert.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bras underneath the dress as the lightning flashes.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon maternity outfit was when she visited her friend for dinner in New York just a couple of days ago.
The outfit was enhanced by black high-end boots.
The third special maternity hug is as fresh as Friday last week when she was pregnant on the show.
The hardest part of being a model is not having a home, being alone, and the competition is fierce.
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to shake the idea that the world of fashion was pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out about mallibisness.
Harper's Bazaar magazine has pulled six hard truths from Leloup's behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
So, even though you've posed in the most prestigious designer outfits in the past season, the casting call is the next season.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces in the field competing with the hard-working ones.
The models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it may take years, with the model's accommodation being a hotel room or a flat in a fashion house.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most coveted jobs, but they're the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinny.
In New York, an agent might ask you to lose weight, but in Paris, they'll tell you you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risky business.
At fashion week, models and designers are always together, and they act as a support network.
When fashion week is over, the difference is tenuous.
The models want to go into this business because of the opportunities it offers, but they're annoyed that everyone thinks the job is just a way to show off clothes.
Models like to be their own person.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors, that they have a role to play.
But modeling is also a way to express yourself.
You were the models at the Tory Burch show yesterday.
New York is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers are unveiling their collections for next year.
Roope Salminen , who has changed her style , will be playing the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film .
Roope Salminen plays the band's founder Antti Lautala in the film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but parted ways with the band in 1994.
I mean, this is a big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist who's about to turn 26, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen, laughing.
I've been trying to avoid meeting the real Ant before the shoot because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is obviously the most unknown to people in that crowd, so I think it's okay that I'm just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to do an imitation of a human.
A man who just plainly believes in Roope Salminen and the Dogs will not be cast.
Punky-dancing comes naturally to a man.
I'm sure many of you saw the first episode of the punk era of Stars, Stars, Stars, and so would anyone who's ever been to one of our shows.
Our performance has never been anything but a little bit of a show, but always a full show.
The main actors of the film "We Are Beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temmen, who played bass in the band from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is represented by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Sipali Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, the singer is Toni Wirtasa, the bassist is Tatu Sinisalo, the bassist is Tuukka Temosa, and the singer is Iiro Rum Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of her upcoming show last night, when she mysteriously told on Snapchat that she was preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Roope, seen earlier with a mustache and chin-beard, has shaved his face to make it silky, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist says this is how you tell your children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, advises Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Younger children should be protected, for example, by not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children may not be able to understand what they see, and it can be confusing and distressing, she says.
However, if your child has seen news footage of refugees on television or heard about it from others, it is worth discussing.
It is good to discuss the child's starting points and to listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may come as a surprise.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he or she fears.
You don't want to scare a child unnecessarily, even if you're the one who's being tormented and scared.
A younger child closely observes the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the children feel safe too.
Older children are likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents do well to discuss the matter with them if it is of concern to the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents can consider with their children how this is viewed in our family.
But is the world, in our view, a safe or a unsafe place?
Parents may also have different views on parenting - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand, if family discussions include difficult subjects, the child will be given a model for dealing with difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

You Can Still Be a Good Parent to Your Child
The Vermonte is striking the Ball State , and it 's hard to contain .
Perttu Pohjola was able to beat Apila Pallosalama in a stunning strike in the middle of the summer.
It only shed wins and runners-up until the collapse of the Tampere Rave at the end of July.
Because the egg was frozen to the very bottom, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered his protege to see a vet.
The explanation for the blackout was found in the stunning flash.
The horse had strep throat.
The disease was not mild, and it took two courses of medicine to suppress it.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be lightly exercised, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE-dam in the market at its peak after Taruntuul.
The Apilan Pallosalama was under great strain from the break, having been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Taking these things into account, Pohjola says, the slight inclination at the end was understandable.
Coach thinks a good competition made the bucks a little sharp.
The horse's turn must have gone further than that, and hopefully it would have leveled out as well.
The Apilan Ball Farm has been known as the "Humor Horse".
When it's not been fun, it could have been fattening without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have unleashed a blaze of lightning that has amazed their opponents.
At low speed, the competitors can't keep up with the Pallosalama, which is even the warm-blooded ride.
The hope of the bottom is the Vermo's fist.
But the difference is how Apple's Ballroom agrees.
It's kind of hard when you're starting and you might be spiking under the brakes of the starting car and stuff.
I hope the bear is more calm than when Turru left.
The Apilan Pallosalama will be able to come from the bow when it's fit and we'll be driving it to victory, coach.
This is why you can 't get rid of the useless iPhone apps .
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhones may be deleted at some point in the future - but not all of it.
Apple may in the future remove some of its software from iPhones, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a bunch of apps that relatively few people use: FaceTime, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to the iPhone, though it is only necessary for owners of Apple's smartwatch.
Cook says that uninstalling Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to something else on the iPhone.
Removing them could cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
The Commission has not received any comments from the interested third parties on the compatibility of the aid.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them", Cook added.
So according to Cook, Apple is looking into this because they don't want to waste memory space on people's iPhones.
Euro area inflation down to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, by 0.1% on the previous year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The price increases were driven down by the fall in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised down slightly its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
The forecast for core inflation by Eurostat was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
The average inflation rate for the EU-28 as a whole was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 percent.
Of these, Malta recorded the highest increase in consumer prices in August, at 1.4%.
Cyprus was the lowest with inflation down by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was negative 0.2%, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains stubbornly far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a price increase of 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The central bank forecasts a further increase to 1.1% next year, in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The Fed is going to try to tighten monetary policy in the United States .
The next US recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but certainly within three years after the Fed begins raising interest rates again after a long time.
And the financial markets will start to fall before the next recession.
The Fed has indicated that they will begin interest rate hikes possibly as early as this week and possibly by the end of the year.
So the next recession may hit as soon as next autumn and the financial markets may be in a better position before then.
Or at least it will be if the world's largest economy and financial markets continue to operate as they have in the past and if they respond to the Fed's extortionist money laundering as they have in the past.
These are the conclusions reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, market research strategists at Deutsche Bank in London, Germany, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major clients last week.
The strategists who wrote the study and the report don't believe they know exactly when the Fed is going to raise rates or what will happen to the economy and the markets afterwards.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rate increases.
In addition to historical observations, they examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different patterns than at the time of past interest rates - and what the possible consequences of this are.
Clearly, the economy, as well as the financial markets, are now in a better position to withstand an increase in interest rates than at any time since the 1950's.
It may not be a year before the recession begins.
The Fed's policy makers and its current staff have been hinting throughout the summer and early fall that the time is ripe for a rate hike.
The first interest rate hike in over nine years could happen as early as this week.
The issue will be decided during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed's board of directors meets to decide on the matter during its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
This marked the end of a two-year series of relatively regular but small interest rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points at a time, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the difficulty of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession started in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy were seriously affected, the onset was slower than has been typical since the previous Fed interest rate reset.
In like manner, the trials were then more severe and severe than ever before the depression of the 1930's.
Deutsche strategists have been sifting through the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the ups and downs of financial markets since 1950 and, in some cases, since the early 1800s.
They've been studying the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the first measles outbreak has been less than a year, the most commonly less than three years, and the average less than three and a half years.
The financial market price slide ended within a year or two of the Fed's interest rate hike.
The Fed has raised and lowered its policy rate on a rotating basis since the early 1950s, on the basis of a dozen discrete cycles.
Each time has been different in some respects from the others, and the rates considered are relatively low, so that they hardly provide any certainty about the effect of subsequent interest rate increases.
And as strategists remind us, this time, many things are different.
And not just better.
You 've been paying too low for too long .
The decisive causes of the financial crisis and the culprits may not be conclusively identified even after decades of research.
But three factors that have led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably quite clear:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world kept their policy rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were cleaning up the technicopla's mess, and growing the next one.
2) The excessive debt accumulated over decades in various parts of the financial and real economy, which was already too high, was further increased by the monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt pile in the history of the economy was born.
3) The madness of debt financing, particularly in the financial sector, has led to the largest price increases in the history of the financial markets, from stocks to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly a matter of hard-headedness to deny that financial markets, which had been soaring on ever more complicated debt levers, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile situation when the Fed and other central banks last pushed up interest rates.
The financial structures set up on the basis of debt swaps, including the appreciation coupons, only lasted a short time after interest accruals had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned to the upside.
The risks were realized in the form of a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
The bigger the bubble, the more debt
The German strategists do not guess what will happen next, but they give the reason for thinking, citing such factors as the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy more accommodative even longer than before the financial crisis.
If before the crisis, interest rates were too low for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been as bad as it was ten years ago, but now the debt is literally worse than it should be.
So instead of the financial and real economic debt burden being lightened, the various sectors of the economy are now burdened with a heavier debt burden than before the financial crisis or half of it at any time.
3) With ever-larger and cheaper central banks, most of the liquidity has been left in the financial markets, holding key securities and assets at their highest prices since the peak before the financial crisis, or at any other time.
Not only do these strategists flatter the mood with warning signs in financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the most severe recession in decades to that pattern that it has ever been.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but the corresponding financial market pressures and risks are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten the monetary policy.
Perhaps the future vision of Albert Edwards, the strategist of Societe Generale, a French bank, is not as strange as it may suddenly appear.
He has been training the bank's international investment clients for a long time to make the following Fed overtures:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to go out and put out the financial bubbles with even bigger QE money strikes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut as many as 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be directed at HP's corporate services division, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's headcount peaked in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
Last October, the number of employees was reduced to 302,000.
The company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises is cutting between 25,000 and 30,000 employees.
The consumer deductions will be reduced to 3,300 over three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries with 60% of its workforce in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating income.
In another year, its three largest customers accounted for 65 percent of the business.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system for iPhone after Apple releases the update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking Start, and then selecting Software Update.
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after installing this software, when the error message Software update failed appears on the screen.
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst of the traffic to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may include deleting apps to gain space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests apps to be deleted and then reinstalled when the update is complete.
You might want to make sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade, so that the battery doesn't run out in the middle.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the upgrade to proceed, because if the battery runs out in the middle, it can lead to the upgrade being aborted.

General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
Anne Berner (centre), Minister for Transport and Communications, has acted as a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involved so-called tax planning.
The Commission considers that the measure is imputable to the State and that it is imputable to the State.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Mr Berner remains officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says that he resigned from the membership in May of this year.
I checked, and it's enough that I've already left a notice of termination.
It is almost impossible to manage and control the logging chain if things happen on a set schedule, says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The assets of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through the Luxembourg company.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor between 2010 and 2013 and after the merger on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Ms Yley, in Luxembourg, the ownership of Kährs's assets is carried out through a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Yelle that he accepted a board position in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of the Kährs.
This one's owned by Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, and they found one in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a Luxembourg company.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland, and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yale that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the capital fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
Espoo opens a company-run reception centre
The first enterprise-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers is to open in Espoo, Finland.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first 100 residents as of 6 p.m. today.
The number of places can increase within a week to 300-400 people.
The Immigration Service will set up a reception centre on the former premises of the Salvation University.
The activities are carried out by Luona Oy, which is mainly engaged in the provision of healthcare and hospital services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy have agreed on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
The CSTO is preparing an alternative workplace blackmail package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government's work-related restrictions.
The organisation also hopes to involve other employers' organisations.
According to the president, Antti Palola, the focus is on the demonstration on Friday.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of labour will be discussed later.
"Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday", Palola told reporters during a break from the organization's board meeting.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European Data Protection Board, which would be composed of representatives of the Member States.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm on the part of a party to have a conversation if there's a one-in-a-hundred relationship on the side.
Palola: The negotiating relationship was constructive
The EU is also calling for the EU to take action to combat terrorism and to support the efforts of the international community to combat it.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'competent authority' to include the use of the term 'competent authority' in the case of a public authority.
According to Palola, the personnel center's STTK field, especially the Sunday night cutting, is a pain in the ass.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation that would allow it to carry out some of the blackmail.
According to Mr Palola, the STTK is not keen to prepare an alternative package with the SDP, which has raised the issue.
The employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest against the government's extortion package.
As part of the package, the first days of sick pay will be cut, overtime benefits will be halved, Sunday benefits will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The STK emphasizes that the central organisations have called for a demonstration of employees and that the intention was not to organize a strike.
The Fader of the Akava thanks
The chairman of the AKAV Sture Fjäder welcomes the announcement by the STTK that an alternative package is being prepared.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now coming into line with AKAVA, as AKAVA already has a more comprehensive alternative model for government proposals.
The Commission is also calling for the inclusion of the SAK in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package would not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyl, will be involved in preparing a proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
The Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that they were preparing new proposals.
We want change management and work-hours banks.
The EU's trade policy is based on the principle of the free movement of goods, goods, services and capital.
Akava has always been willing to negotiate, and we've been writing alternative models for the government's proposals for a long time.
We're prepared to look at the terms of service as part of the contract.
In return, we want a changeover policy and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the lines of the Akava, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the national government and employers, says Fjäder.
The ACA Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcoots" - playing bingo while the Bat talks in the evening
Green Left at the University of Tampere
The bingo card of the green leftist Viva from Tampere University for the evening.
Prime Ministers have made speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on the Ylen channel on Wednesdays at 21.05 in a very exceptional way.
To find the last speech by the current Prime Minister, we have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister and made the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and the continuing war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech in place of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the railway workers' strike with a televised speech.
Private conversation, monarchical attitude
The ant's speech has sparked a whole day of criticism and speculation about what's to come.
The chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that "Sipilä could make his State of the Nation speech in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed".
According to the Green Party, "one-on-one has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "it is a monarchist attitude: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP chairman Antti Rinne challenged the Octopus to dialogue: "It's been six months since the elections.
Not a single appearance of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
I tried that.
What is the @juhuspilas afraid of?
The public service
According to the State Council, Sipilä's speech was recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the President of the EC, Jyri Häkämies, commented on the live broadcast.
Yale has been criticized for making a speech on the Octopus.
We thought about it and decided that it is part of the public service's mission to promote publicity for the whole of Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at YLE.
Like us in the days of the Tamiles
The speech has also been the subject of ridicule.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, the children will be dressed and groomed.
Mom puts on a pretty little coat and Dad puts on a tie.
At nine o'clock, the television is silenced, as it was in the old days during the Me Tammeloid era", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also explained why the Finnish government is made up of millionaires hiding in tax havens, who are drawing up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
One of the hypotheses is that the Green Left Party Viva of Tampere University is behind the report.
It's posted a secret bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the coal, the debt, the team spirit?
Get your pens and coupons ready, it starts at 21:05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Western countries reject Russian proposal to oust Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected an offer from Russia to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
Ahtisaari said that the Russian ambassador to the UN had proposed a plan that would have seen al-Assad leave power in style after a period of time.
The West, however, did not take up the proposal, believing that al-Assad would fall within weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Ahtisaari said that during a private conversation with him, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tsurkin outlined a three-point plan: the opposition would not be armed, the opposition would immediately establish a dialogue with Assad, and the Assad government would be quietly removed.
I know Tsurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can discuss things openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do", Ahtisaari recalled in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting .
Ahtisaari says that he passed on the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
The content of the conversation was not confirmed by Tshurkin to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that by that time, al-Assad's forces had already committed several mass killings and that key opposition groups had rejected any deal that would have kept him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Office's Middle East division, is skeptical of Ahtisaari's comments because, according to his experience, Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's argument is that Tsurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Churkin's speech, I would have said that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he suspected that even in that case, it was a ploy by Putin to keep a pro-Assad supporter in power.
The stream of our own actions
During the Ahtisaari negotiations, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been displaced by war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
"We are now paying the bill we ourselves have caused", Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' centre in the suburbs of Tornio
The asylum centre planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty building of the Tornion Community College in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsinki Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the city council had already decided to submit the school building to the ministry as a land solution.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), the deputy chairman of the Tornio city council, this is not true.
"When the whole council was not present and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter", he told STT.
The debate was attended by 36 of the 43 Members of the European Parliament.
The O.C. was opposed by 13 councilors.
On that basis, one could expect a positive decision, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
It is estimated that the community could accommodate 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
"The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense", Nousiainen says.
The ant still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre), the publicly announced halving of holiday pay would only partially achieve the government's aim of reducing the cost of work.
The government would be happy to accept an alternative package, if the social partners agree to it.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
Nor did he know how earnestly the organizations sought to find alternatives to the government's reported workplace harassment.
If such a deal were to be concluded, we would certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
The Commission is also proposing to reduce the number of employees in the private sector by reducing the number of employees in the public sector.
The trade unions could agree among themselves on the cutting of holiday allowances, since they are enshrined in collective agreements rather than in the law.
The government will inform Parliament on Wednesday of the extortion of the working class in the form of a report from the Council of State.
According to the grasshopper, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
There's no final deadline here either.
The legislative work then starts moving, that is, the train is moving and it gets harder and harder.
It's a very good time.
It doesn't take long to get a will to do something like this, does it, Mr. Squirrel?
The list published by the government last week includes the change of the weekend and the Thursday of the week into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, the first days' sick pay will be cut, overtime benefits will be halved, Sunday benefits will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as a mandatory legislative measure by way of the trade unions, which has been the subject of strong criticism.
The workers' unions are organising a demonstration on Friday, and several unions have called for a political strike.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the Mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy's hall, or warehouse, with a slightly different layout.
Criticism was raised that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
And the busy schedule was a pain.
It was little wonder that the capacity was not known a year ago when the last enlargement was decided.
At this stage, an extension of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the amount will be decided later in the interim report.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the existing aid scheme to the new Member States, in order to ensure that the new Member States are able to meet the needs of the population.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring jobs and tax revenue to the local community.
The municipality is not at risk, as the investment is paid for by the company as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
The Karelian tongue is also found in Joensuu
The city government eased its previously rigid stance to bring Karelian-language cotton signs into downtown Johannesburg.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karean language, because it has no historical basis and Karean is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the area of the river has been more of an Eastern Savoy language.
After the new decision, there will be no Karate-speaking cotton signs in the city center.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing, on a case-by-case basis.
The same approach is recommended by the City to all other stakeholders.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worthwhile to have a broad-minded attitude to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in Northern Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a distinctive feature of the province, as well as the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of these can be put to good use in the county's many marketing efforts.
The closure of the railway lines is cutting off the province's vitality.
The cuts to the rail system are hitting the county's vital resources with a heavy hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the economic life and competitiveness of the region.
And that will affect whether we can live and work here at all, wonders Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been mentioned in the report on several occasions.
It's important to the county that we don't lose our chances by taking government action, as we're seeing now.
The Commission has also proposed that the EU should be able to provide the EU with a comprehensive set of data on the use of the euro.
The deterioration of transport connections is creating additional challenges for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, the rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that even now it is difficult to market the university in the West of Finland, because the cross-connections are weak.
At present, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from the Netherlands, which is partly due to the direct rail link.
The river became one of the sounds of the great Sioux war
The Joensuu City Council's view of the provincial Siun sot project is seemingly unanimous, but one voice is also among them.
Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) of the city council proposed at the council meeting on Monday to abandon the whole project, but his proposal was rejected.
The government approved the decision of the mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the meeting of the city council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Koovla ends next year
Passenger trains from the Eagle to the Cave will continue to run, although one train per hour will be less frequent.
There will be changes to passenger train services between Åka and Kåvla next March.
One train couple is missing, but still five times a day, you can get from Eagle to the Cave and back.
The shrinkage is due to government austerity.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' railway purchase allowance for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million.
The quietest routes will be closed.
VR will be working on new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one of them couldn't get down, the guys ran off.
The rescue team released a 12-year-old boy who had climbed onto the roof and was unable to get off on his own.
The incident occurred on Tornionmäni Ketoti at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
That did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb onto the roof of the house by the side of the amateur radio mast.
All the other boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others fled the scene, and passersby alerted the rescue services to help pull the last one on the roof safely back to the ground.
FedEx operating profit doubles, lowering its 2016 fiscal year outlook
FedEx is reporting dismal results for its latest quarter, and the shipping giant cut its full-year forecast due to weakened demand for freight services and higher costs for its global services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock dropped about 2.5 percent in the opening bid 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the fiscal year ending next May to be $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook came despite the average price increase of 4.9% which will come into effect on 4 January and despite higher additional charges for heavy or large parcels transported by road, which started in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, increased sales and increased online sales.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was 'performing well in the face of weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade'.
The plans for the holiday payroll were announced the day after rival UPS said it would hire between 90,000 and 95,000 extra workers, about the same number it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx's revenue was $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
The earnings per share came in at $2.42, down from the average forecast of $2.44, according to a survey of 12 analysts by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transport which has halted the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the rise of online shopping has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land division increased by 29%, but the revenues of the activities were essentially the same due to the high costs of the larger packages and the own insurance.
The Express unit's revenue was better due to higher base charges, while the operating profit in the freight business was lower due to higher labour costs.
At the opening bidding, about an hour before the bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday 11 percent lower than the previous year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
Federal Reserve officials are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the bank's ornate, two-story conference room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed's Chairman, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests ahead of all else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Depression, central bankers have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement may be the decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be foreseen, whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off the record stimulus provided by the near-zero level of short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
While most of the data indicates that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already cautious central bank officials more fearful of further instability, fearing what would happen if the federal funds rate were raised by even a quarter of a percentage point.
'Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things to watch,' says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
'However, I think that if they are looking for a justification for keeping interest rates, the increased uncertainty on world markets is a valid enough reason to wait,' he says.
The central bank's decision has not been agreed, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of all financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the growth rate is only around 30%.
This refers to the decline in the stock market if the central bank raises the rate, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next rate hike will not be in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to a new high of 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by expectations that the central bank will maintain its level this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now", he says.
If policy makers raise interest rates, they will have to make a lot of effort in their policy making to support the financial markets so as not to panic.
Other experts argue that the raised level would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank will act.
Just a month ago it seemed that the central bank would raise the rate of interest by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary environment that would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year, despite the appeals of the Liberals for more economic development.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years and near the level the central bank considers to be the full employment threshold.
Wage growth has shown signs of improving.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, central bank policy makers believe that this is due to the temporary impact of the sharply lower oil price.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them, given the tight labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were rocked last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percent from its May high, as investors feared that a slowing economy in China would also slow global growth.
Markets have recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below its May peak.
For central bank policymakers, market volatility is an additional factor in the complex equation that tells them when to raise interest rates.
"Without these financial market events and the recent news coverage of the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would tighten the balance at this meeting", says Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better sense of the impact.
The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they have little information at their disposal about the consequences of events in China,says Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not a central bank's primary concern and should, in principle, not influence its decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank has had a huge influence.
In 2013, then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's suggestion that the central bank could "reduce" the amount of money it adds caused a stir in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is 'more art than science,' says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "the central bank has in the past overreacted to movements in financial markets that have appeared to be detached from the fundamentals of the economy".
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for an interest rate hike, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings, despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth, says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only give priority to financial stability during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's (BoE) interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil will not come close to that level, Posen says.
'No one wants to be in a situation where they fear raising interest rates because the markets are getting worse,' says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double requirement and makes no mention of financial stability, and as long as that is the case, I don't think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Pediatric Association in Rio Grande promotes healthy diet for those who breast-feed
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has devised a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients needed for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
But new research suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects the babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Channel Seven's Sunrise is the favorite to stay on the air despite Channel Nine's attempts to headline the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report on the Liberal Party leadership landslide failed to boost Today's ratings.
The morning show on Channel Nine was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stranded in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the interim did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, with the Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers in the five state capitals, compared to the Today's 339,000.
The daily average was slightly higher than on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but still below last Thursday (343 000).
Today has picked up on Sunrise over the last few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunris's was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far this September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, but not in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news on Channel Seven was an 800-word series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, in a stunning first foray.
The new drama, which averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson could be the driving force behind the popular series on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him a real sense of security.
Seven's The X Factor was the strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Channel Seven had a double-flat on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.) of the new whistleblowing programme, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, drew an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half of the show, 5:30 to 6:00, was watched by 623,000 people, which was enough to win a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat.
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers for the first half-hour, and a whopping 720,000 for the second half-hour.
The average for the Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australian's second night of declining ratings gives Channel Nine confidence that Hot Seat will ultimately be the most popular program at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce viewership of McGuire's program.

The final three fathers agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who is he gonna pick?
The secret is out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could have accidentally revealed who would win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been kept under wraps.
The three remaining girls really don't care who got the last rose.
However, in our conversations with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they may have inadvertently given a clue to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were poetic in their description of Wood as the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?" their answers may have provided a clue as to who won the boy's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been on a roll since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah's] energies and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind throughout the series", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be with her", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They seem to be having a nice, relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a great couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this", she said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say it", he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Channel Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has a lot of options for where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the States, and many other teams have been asking about him after his impressive open practice day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the final game after the Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flying kick to return the ball to the team in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight bag and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
The true nature of Tomsula was also revealed in the locker room after the game.
Instead of berating his new recruits as a pest in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special correspondent Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the fly ball that the Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the start that Hayne and his many Australian fans hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way off the field after the drop, and later told Australian radio talk show host Hamish & Andylle on 2DayFM at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared his acidity to his 2007 Origin debut, when a pitch in his own infield led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed on his Instagram account for a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, and as a result, he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his efforts to promote democracy were curtailed.
4 killed in police firing rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to cause so many deaths.
The rally was the latest in weeks of violent protests across southern Nepal by members of the ethnic group called the Madhesi, who say the new provinces created under the proposed new constitution will weaken their political clout.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands their own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of them police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed a treaty dividing the land into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have this week voted on the constitutional provisions in Kathmandu, and officials have said a new constitution could be adopted by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says that there is a 60 percent chance of a tornado to the south of Cape Verde.
A broad low pressure front, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another closely monitored low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verdean archipelago and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather center added.
Google launches a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have arrived in Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an exceptionally personal view when it published the fundraiser on its blog.
Instead of the CEO making the announcement, it was Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, who wrote from her own personal experience.
"Our journey included many dark journeys by train and bus, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has escalated, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations are going to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match each donation made on google.com/refugeerelief worldwide up to $5.5 million, bringing the total goal to $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, driven primarily by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing the ravages of war in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
It's a great way to get to know your family.
Weight- Loss Surgery Can Help People With Slightly Obese Diabetes
A new study suggests that the benefits of weight-loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight-loss surgery than those treated by other means than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight-loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
In weight-loss or bariatric surgery, various techniques are used to reduce the size of the abdominal cavity.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the study participants were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
A BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.
A BMI of more than 25 indicates that a person is overweight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, to the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The study showed that the average BMI of the operated persons dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of subjects treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, 36 percent had a complete recovery and 28 percent had a partial recovery.
By comparison, diabetes was reduced by only 1% in the medically treated group and by about 2% in the partially treated group.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and 'bad' LDL-cholesterol were generally better in the surgery group, the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood of the patients, which reflects blood glucose levels over a long period of time.
The hemoglobin A1c level should be kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
The post-operative haemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
However, this improved 'glycemic control', as indicated by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The team also compared the mean outcomes between the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the gastric bypass group, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had a lower BMI (7.4 and 5.1), had a lower hemoglobin A1c (3.1 and 2.1%) and were more likely to achieve complete remission of diabetes (46.9 and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are studies from Sweden where surgery led to longer life in people who were heavier.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent weight-loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period when compared with a group who had tried more conventional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in survival for surgery patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for those with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
The crucial finding of the study is that it shows that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group and is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously at a time when a patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously", he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
 Not everyone can come to Europe  - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot take in all the refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee camps.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Oxford-based Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion at the start of his ten-day visit to Britain, a centre dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all of humanity should be put before the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was also inadequate.
'Not everyone can come to Europe', he said in his speech.
While praising the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The bottom line is, how can we reduce the killing in their country?
We need to reduce our use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response of the United States caused a chain of violent events.
After 9/11, I wrote a letter of condolence to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, swallowing hand sanitizers by children has quadrupled
Poison control centers throughout the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the ingestion of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers by children under 12, according to the Georgia Center for Toxicology Information.
According to the head of the Georgia Poison Data Center, Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the number of cases of swallowing with disinfectants reported to the Poison Data Center by children under the age of 12 increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are interested in these products more often, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them end up in daycare centers", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some kids drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or answer a challenge on social media.
There are YouTube videos of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get a paralytic asthma attack.
Reports have been that teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant scents of disinfectants may attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him", Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting ones are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few injections are needed to inject alcohol.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", said Mr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Information Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey lying around on the table, but you leave hand sanitizer lying around, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Njahhai Russell is a six-year-old girl who a short time ago ingested only four sprays of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the adult DWI limit, says emergency room physician Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was speechless and unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors watched her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain damage, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary", Nhaija's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move disinfectants and products out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizer containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities believe that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January in upstate New York, three fourth-grade students planned to poison their "unidentified teacher by spreading a bacterial poison in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
The police must dismiss the plan as nonsense and leave the disciplinary action to the school district.
I 'm not saying that Celtic has no contradictions .
Griffiths downplays the talk of Celtic's conflict, and Deila admits Hoops is in a tight spot, but he'll get it turned around.
Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Association over the Neilson allegations, and Warburton is wary of January recruits who could disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons increased his lead to Celtic by five points.
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the gap to Celtic by five points.
Griffiths is downplaying the contradictions .
There have been rumours of internal divisions at Celtic, but Griffiths has quickly brushed them off, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under close scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Dutch champions.
I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are waiting for a meeting.
The lack of a Scottish championship race will make the Dutch tired of the Boers .
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the championship with Rangers.
The current Ajax ambassador de Boer said: "The Netherlands no longer show the highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't in.
People around here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in the games of these teams, and even non-Scots want to follow the games.
Deila vows to turn this around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the tide.
The loss to Malmo and the subsequent relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to the ten-man Aberdeen, who now lead the series by five points.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods in the past and we will rise again".
Now all we want to do is get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
It's important that we stay together now.
Warburton is wary of January's player transfers.
Despite the comments made by Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago about possible January transfer deals, he is cautious about the recruiting process, saying he doesn't want to upset the team's consensus.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different compared to the summer window. "
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the whole pre-season, which is reflected in our squad this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can cause more trouble.
The Celtic interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been linked to the transfer window to Celtic, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swansea expires.
The 29-year-old has been battling ankle problems for two years and has been unable to find a new partner outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Association because of Neilson 's comments .
Hearts led 2-1 after Paterson was sent off, and the team subsequently lost 3-2 after the defender's red card was later overturned, making it the third red card overturned by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by his words, claiming, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance".
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle .
A loyal Hibernian player was punished after admitting to singing a derogatory song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a moment of excitement", the striker added, "but it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move to Celtic".
The Tannaide board believes in the leadership of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the tide, but admits that the player demise must end.
I think Stephen Thompson is counting on us.
We'll get the boys back on their feet, says Donnelly.
McInnes, happy for his victory in the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, hung in there desperately against Hamilton Accies, but managed to get a first-half penalty kick from Adam Rooney to secure their seventh consecutive league win, which moved them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that has won anything, be it a cup or a league, that has not also won games in this way".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as the UK's total unemployment rate rises
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 in the period May to July, while unemployment in the whole of Britain rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, at 5.9%, is higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 persons over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on these latest figures, David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, said: 'The government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.'
It is almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma ?
If there is no judicial intervention, I will watch the man be executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the audience at Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Gloss execute by lethal injection.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm beginning to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would give you a unique perspective.
Of course, reporters have access to executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, the participants are selected by a gruesome jury.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to 15.
Whoever gets elected, they're gonna look at it cool.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossop's closest friends, and I have also established my own connection with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pencil to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
There's a lesson in this.
Tell the prisoner's story in the way he wants it told, and you'll be in on it.
I complained to a reporter.
He admitted that he could have put his words better, but he still feels that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I've told him he can always take me off his witness list.
But he wants to have an international reporter on the scene to cover it.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is standing right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to my podcast series.
I'm not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Gloss is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of aiding and abetting in any case.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he didn't commit murder.
I'm pretty sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that executing him is wrong.
And so this is the angle from which I'm watching him die.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
There'll be other reporters around to take care of it.
I'm gonna give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I care about die needlessly.
A man was lured away from the Canning River after a water police chase.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry when he lured the man away from the Canning River.
The Perth man's attempt to throw the police off their trail went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water, just metres from a policeman who tried to gently lure him back to shore.
Canning Vale Police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for an unauthorised intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by pointing them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" Senior Chief Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "Police negotiation".
'Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape,' said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins, a champion soccer player, is a good example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a blow-out and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He was unsuccessful in his attempt, but he inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the reporters tried to spy on him and threatens to quit the race.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's reporters tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year, and he's threatening to stop racing immediately.
He's accusing the press and Racing Victoria's integrity department of running a personal campaign against him, and on Wednesday, the late dismissal of Lady Tata due to a medical procedure on race day was the final nail in the coffin.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his mouth shut about the alleged espionage for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like he was jealous.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it all comes out at once", Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
And when they start to think differently, that's when I'm not supposed to be coaching anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man who asked for his name and offered him a job in my warehouse if he would give me information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, I say they should fire their lawyers for failing to apprehend me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Am I supposed to start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to step up and maybe even shift the responsibility for what happens in the industry to someone other than the coaches?
Am I a detriment to the industry?
Am I so detrimental to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now may make them think that.
But I'm at the point now where I don't care anymore, and it's making me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I'm pressing them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-term study of Lidari's cobalt, and the late dismissal has led him to conclude that he could throw his license over the table.
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the racetrack's rules on grooming "a laughingstock" after mud or clay is put on the horse's feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was yesterday.
It was on race day.
Moody may be facing a three-month ban from competition for the day-to-day funeral arrangements that officials began investigating.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know shit about horses.
'We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,' said Moody.
In Cobram, a driver arrested for traffic violation
Police have arrested a man who was arrested after he hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after suffering serious injuries when he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway early Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove off and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathaliya turned himself in to the police in Shepparton.
He's gonna be charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident, failure to assist, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is taking on the competition in the men's heavyweight division.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised claims in two NRL Rugby League championships that his team's tackles were part of the 'bullshit'.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires had allowed Storm to "fight" on their side after it unexpectedly won the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett, who barely managed to cover his reference to the Storm after beating the North Queensland Cowboys in Saturday night's final, called the game "a window to the rugby league" and said the two Queensland teams were "not enthusiastic" about the match.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were just focusing on the "contact" tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was heightened by the two leading coaches' criticism of Storm, as it means they fear losing to the team.
"This is always going to be talked about - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the fumes when we lost to them 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or our technology this year, and for the last six weeks, we have only been pressing the contact button on the tacks, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "excitingly".
Wayne's talking about the exciting game of rugby.
"He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a dull team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we think is exciting, especially with his fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have that kind of players.
He brought that side to the table in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I feel more confident when they say things like that, because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more peppered than the Broncos vs. the Cowboys.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end?
We had a 20-18 game, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line and not score?
For me, this is about lines.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them at some point.
The Storm will have the weekend off, having already won the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-season on Saturday night at AAMI Park, and tickets will go on sale on Tuesday morning.
$ 200,000 bail for a Serbian man on a drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to smuggle 40 kilos of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 kilos of drugs for the Solay yacht, which came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with other defendants at the marina for the entire morning, and then meeting them at the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
While Maksimovitsa faces a possible life sentence for possession of cocaine in a business-related amount, her lawyer argued that there is no evidence that Maksimovic was trying to keep the full amount and that he could have been in the cafe for entirely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
He has solid ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often, he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimov's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bond to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them", Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from turning himself in, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and adhere to his curfew between 9pm and 6am.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send him pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request child abuse photos.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online chat service, where Hogg received numerous indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, found the phone was missing, and found it asleep in Hogg's hand.
She looked through the phone and found the shocking messages, and then immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers at the scene, and found "worrying" web-searching terms used to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "hook up to paedophiles" on the internet, before he "pretended to be a police officer to scare them".
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court the following: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had conducted the experiments on a computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman in order to frighten off the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the photos, and about Hogg asking the person to send him additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did it for the purpose of the pass.
He said he was drunk and his head was sick, and he wanted to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, trembled and cried.
The mother saw the lewd images on the phone and then beat up the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to one count of making or taking indecent images of children on 14 June last year, breach of bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
The defence lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be entered on the sex offenders register, as it could be argued that his offence did not include a 'significant sexual element'.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has postponed his sentencing until October so that the social services can have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in the other cases pending, he's in custody pending trial.
He was added to the sex offender registry before sentencing.
In Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe made a false speech to the parliament .
Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs earlier this year on his way to the rally.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the crash went viral on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by the allegations by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them not to bully Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him and interrupted him with intermittent shouts when he was giving a State of the Union address to Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a group disciplinary officer for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the message is titled death, Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament and that when they left, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group's overseer said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its corporate services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from the faster growing corporate hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
'These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,' said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"We will have a broader and deeper range of services to help companies transition to new business models", said Whitman.
As a separate business, we are better able than ever to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions for businesses, the company said in a statement.
The company was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment in a garage in Palo Alto, which is called the "birthplace of the Pi Valley".
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, and its split is the latest in a line of business based on the belief that tightly-knit companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and assuming that his recovery is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be back playing by Christmas.
In the best case, Wilshere will miss at least the next four England games and, given his background, there is uncertainty about his participation in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere's last season ended strong after a single ankle injury, and he's recalling his old edge before the season started.
"A career like this is not in danger", said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's not unusual.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his ankle or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return mid-season, there is always a risk of further injury.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern forming.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd investigation, Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, he has only played in 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the past five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's wider set-up since the 2007-08 season, in six of eight seasons they have been one of the Premier League teams with the most days lost to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility, but Arsenal believe their improvement from last season will continue into the new season.
"Sometimes when you're recovering from injury, there can be a period of vulnerability, where you have to strengthen your body and get competitive", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, and I'm sure it will, and that he can have the career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to re-shape his team as Arsenal begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, followed by Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey haven't been to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably in the Initiative.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the spotlight, replacing Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain the balance and give a break to the players who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to win the F-Block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo have also not lost 41 matches since they produced their own 'Unbeaten' campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous", said Wenger.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not visionaries.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us some serious lessons about male friendship
It is striking how similar the portrayals are in the series, especially considering that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the year of men, challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 middle and high school students who were depressed found that a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of their friends were "healthy in mind".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half as likely to develop potential mental health problems if they had healthy friends in mind.
But for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this age of social media communication, style overrides content and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, when in reality isolation reigns.
And this superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values -- the inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really does not buy greater happiness.
And the thing about Freddy was that it turned this whole thing on its head.
Neither character was defined by their work, but rather by their personalities, which were clearly evident in their interactions as friends.
The numerous hugs of Joey and Chandler, the moments in the comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, though they often hesitate to explore their feelings fully.
As a volunteer from Samaritans explained to me: "...listening to people who are depressed and self-defeating, I really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.
Often, men who contact us feel they cannot speak to their friends.
The old idea of getting beyond is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to your problems, you'll be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer more long-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of male friendship.
While my neutral, outside position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're attending the Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned for the occasion, why not take your friends for coffee at Central Park.
Or, better yet, if you see someone at Starbucks who's lonely, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends aired on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG knock Malmö out of the game.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan for their goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake the Swedes at Malmö on Tuesday.
I'll get you the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right as Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League match with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut with less than four minutes to clear the way for the French champions, but the team squandered several opportunities before finally adding to their lead when Cavan struck in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in the same A-Division as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as the game was not only a second place, but also an improvement in their quarter-final games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic match, as Laurent Blanc's team lost Zlatan Ibrahimovic in front of the goal and was later replaced on the pitch.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win is going to be a problem for the opposition and it looks good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we have to iron out this season", Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we were not able to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian side after an injury, one of three changes made after the team were drawn 2-2 in a Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but he was left in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine striker was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran the Marco Verrat goal from behind Malmo's defence and then hit a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back of the net.
But if anyone expected PSG to win easily and big, they were disappointed.
Malmö were a tough opponent, they beat Celtic in the deciding game to get to this level, their starting line-up has nine international players and a five-man defence and two players in deep midfield.
But the team offered little to the attack except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which just missed Kevin Trapp's goal.
Instead, PSG were sometimes bogged down by missed passes and poor finishes, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half alone and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in Ibrahimovic's touch at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in making preparations for his colleagues, and it was after Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent off a spin that tilted Wiland's goal around the 52nd minute mark.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play, thanks to Uruguay's Cavan, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had punched forward from the left of Maxwell's cross.
Malmo's hopes of getting back in the game were dashed, and only Wiland's brilliant tackle from David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down, before the goal from Ezequiel Lavezz, who came on as a substitute, was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was last December".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight.
I raise my hat to Paris.
They had a great game.
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion by selling shares
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which was suffering from a commodity shortage, raised an average of $2.5 billion selling shares as part of its extensive debt-sharing plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is weighing on demand and wreaking havoc on all markets.
The re-branding of Glencore's stock has pushed it to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trading.
The shares rose 2.77 per cent to 131.60 in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had disclosed a $2.5 billion stock deal last week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new stock at 125p a share, which meant a 2.4% reduction in Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, representing a total value of 9.99% of the unit.
Long-term concerns about China's stagnating growth have cut the price of iron ore by about half, while at the same time the price of coal, copper, and other commodities has fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms that Xi Jinping will be visiting Washington .
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement released Tuesday.
The first official visit by Mr Xi to Washington will take place on 25 September and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for X and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with an opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on matters of disagreement, the statement added.
The visit, first announced in February, is expected to include a stopover in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with a number of US technology leaders before continuing on to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is playing down the diversity of the film industry.
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On the HBO Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown as he stressed the need for a different perspective on the dark-skinned lead character chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's the thing that's going to be considered when casting the movie, not the show", Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted with hurtful disbelief, commenting "Oho! Wow! Okay!" while the actor's comments from The Martian remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat the character of 'Harmonie'", Brown said at the outset.
The only black character is a hooker who gets beaten up by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film from the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied curtly that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was aired, social media exploded in outrage at Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film's performance, writing: Matt Damon talking over the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WORTH it happens.
The tweet has amassed over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the murder of teen Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide, calling on lawmakers and authorities to end practices that discriminate against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he announced the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Awards.
"The albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement in response to a question from Fox News anchor Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group", the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to the Pope's visit to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional boxer and collector of utensils Isaac Caldiero on Monday became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and the grand prize of one million dollars.
Now in its seventh season, the show has never had a competitor who has survived the show's entire runway.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope about 75 feet long in 30 seconds.
The Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to clear the grueling fourth section of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero was interviewed by E!News after his hard-won victory and was still in shock over winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's a great thing to think about, when I've never made or lived on anything more than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production executive Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten is not getting more prize money, despite being the first competitor in history to make it through the line.
The rules say that the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money goes to the one with the fastest time", Weed said.
Although the money is a great reward and changes life, it does bring a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
His fans have been praising him.
He's a great guy and a great family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for an eighth season, with filming to begin in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers sneak past the Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season hasn't been a very good one for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best teams in baseball, but now they're last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their role as the underdog perfectly Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins have lost their chance to advance to the playoffs against the Houston Astros in a contest for the second wild card spot in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was, for at least one night, a return to the six-letter H that had been so elusive for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they're won", said Tigers team manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive play as Detroit scored three runs in the first two innings, then one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want to finish strong this year", Simon said.
It's hard for a substitute to pitch every game, and that's why I want to go deep.
Tigers relief pitcher Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, his first hits in a run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hitter since he hit four against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was a good swinging batsman", Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked much better in batting practice, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs down in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance to get back in the game.
And now, the quarterback, Byron Buxton, has opened the inning with two outs to the left fielder.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was out for a single, and Simon got a direct burn on second baseman Brian Dozier before Simon was traded to left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only opposing player, to the starting pitcher Miguel Sano, who was two-thirds to left of right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and an equalizing runner on the second base, VerHagen got a three-run hit by Trevor Plouffen to score the game-winning run for the double.
It was a major league record, the 27th of the season, with Plouffe hitting a triple.
After Detroit had a save in the ninth inning, Mauer hoisted a two-run home run against Tiger closer Bruce Rondon, making it 5-4.
But the right-hander burned Sano in three at-bats in the fifth save.
Detroit was using Phil Hughes in the first place.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a veteran right-hander who was removed from the injured list before the game after being out for over a month with a lower-body infection.
"It's clear that I didn't want this kind of start", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and felt I had made some nice passes in the third inning".
After catching the first-base hitter, Hughes gave second-baseman Ian Kinsler a one-run lead.
The right-handed J.D. Martinez's walk in the two-run situation brought home the bat for Victor Martinez, who drove himself into the centerfield with the first pitch and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 with the runners in good running position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and cause a second run, but the scare ended when Victor Martinez was ejected in his attempt to advance to third.
The Tigers continued on the second play and got a one-run, two-base run from catcher James McCann and two-run, one-base run from center Anthony Gose, then it was 3-0.
"It was a crucial hit", Twins team manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew right to the point.
Hughes started to be in the passing game and pitched a no-hitter in the third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk on four balls.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was sidelined with a strained shoulder.
He's being studied by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August with a dislocated shoulder, but he was scheduled to return Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will come off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' record at the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts since he was traded for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th, due to a right-sided abdominal strain.
The three-game series between the Tigers and the Twins will conclude Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2 with a 4.43 ERA) is set to face Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for wider opening of economy to the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a panel tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
China should commit to attracting foreign finance and expertise and develop a policy of openness, he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group for Deepening General Reform.
The EU is also working to develop a new strategy for the EU's external relations, which will be based on the EU's own external relations.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restrictions on market access, the relaxation of border controls, the encouragement of State-owned enterprises to take up private capital, and the review of the system of resident registration.
The opinion calls for the creation of a negative list of sectors and enterprises in which investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes markets more transparent, the opinion said.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
Opening up government-controlled sectors to private investors will open up more sectors.
The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services, the opinion said.
In addition, the application process for green cards for foreign permanent residents will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practise their profession and the support for professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and Senior Leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
