Rapidly Growing Collective Prevalence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is showing similar trends in the European Union/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in all countries, occurring at different stages depending on the country.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should boost their preparation for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown specialist-scientific group of pneumonia cases was notified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China, the new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases observe a vaginal disease requiring serious care.
COVID-19 causes the death rate of approximately 4% of hospitalized patients.
In this study, we evaluate the overall prevalence trend of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to its Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK during January 31 - March 15, 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued its geographical expansion and the current COVID-19 epidemic has surged in the rest of the world.
On March 11, 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an epidemic.
In the 5 March 2020 edition of Eurosurvival, Spiteri et al. the first European-certified COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, France the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on January 24, 2020.
By 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date in Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths.
Achieving the cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministries of Health of the countries, the National and Regional Health Authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) report COVID-19 cases from each country in the world are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it with the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the short aggregate prevalence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January – 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the aggregate number of cases in each country between January 31 and March 15, 2020 compared to Italy between March 15, 2020 and 8:00 in the morning.
The trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of the short 14-day aggregate prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began around 21 February and increased rapidly around 28 February 2020 (supplemental content).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases from Italy, but the same increasing trend was seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (supplementary content).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and Italy compared to the UK in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This shows in particular that by 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already the total number of cases comparable to those in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the epidemic is growing at a comparative rate in all countries.
It occurs at different stages across countries, despite differences in national public health responses and potentially different case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients across countries, which should necessarily be investigated for confirmation of COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy a condition in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Statistics on hospitalization and/or intensive care for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (statistics are not shown).
They should, however, be collected in an updated manner to supplement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study found that the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe varied significantly from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 2010-11, 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population).
90% of risk-related hospitalization cases of COVID-19 spread in intensive care bed capacity with forecasts for each EU/EEA country and the UK Simulation of health care capacity saturation-related conditions was provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s acute risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far remained stacked in EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units generally provide services to a defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should primarily be made available at the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care providers should therefore prepare themselves for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients in need of continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and health care, especially in the affected regions of Italy, such as intensive care.
As indicated in the recent ECDC’s acute risk assessment, with a change in approach to mitigating from limiting, a sharp, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if the timelines were not implemented, the anticipated sharp increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and therefore optimize their response.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures to overcome the effects of the epidemic.
Countries have very few opportunities to increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
If this fails, it is highly likely that other EU/EEA countries’ health care systems will face a rapid increase in patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in disasters for humans.
Like its penetrating virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by measles and produces similar symptoms by object activity.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is much more contagious and affects older people and women more than young people.
In light of the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a topical and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will incorporate basic things on disease epidemics, hematology, toxicology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention.
Although there are still a lot of questions to answer, we hope this review will help us understand the deadly disease and eliminate it.
As a result of the outbreak of Novell viral disease on January 25, 2020, the spring has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay at home for the entire holiday and then for several weeks.
The virus is much more similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of hyperacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 patients dying due to the virus.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is “the enemy number one of the people” and is possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including toxicology, epidemics, hematology, diagnosis, and treatment, determining the sequence of the virus by isolating many patients.
This review seeks to present the essence of research progress on new and rapidly developing subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to other diseases caused by SARS and CoV, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learnt so far in relation to disease prevention and forecasting as well as some other yet very necessary questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered to be non-dangerous pathogens for humans with generating about 15% of the common winter 4s.
However, in this century we have faced two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the causes of which were originally seen in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible illness and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the herd of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, was first notified to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoV continued.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case from Wuhan was.
During this time, the epidemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infection was in healthcare providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation shut down.
In the first clinical study on the disease on January 24, it was that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with Wuhan’s seafood market, which was considered the starting place of infection from an unknown grain source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and 50 other countries in the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is growing rapidly, the final extent and intensity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the epidemic of the following types (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mostly between the ages of 30 and 65.
Approximately half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and around it in flocks.
COVID-19 lasted an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before 23 January 2020 increased rapidly, which corresponds to the widespread traffic before the Spring Spring in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a sub-family of large and infested viruses with a single struggle of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The cover node (S) in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively binds to its cellular progenitor enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) respectively and then fuses the membrane.
Viral RNA genome is released into cellular tissue; after replication of the viral genome, the coating creates genomic RNA virioned buds with glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins, which are subsequently merged into the plasma membrane for the elimination of the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV that found more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequentially infected samples collected from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 particle was found in super-member segments of the human airway substrate.
Human ACE2 was found to be a progenitor for SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2, orf3b-coded Novell may also make short proteins and orf8-coded secreted proteins.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and block the manifestation of IFNβ; although orf8 has no known functional domain or moth.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in mixture with the amino amino amino peripheral B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimmer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could attach two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a medical target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The primary intermediate.
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from scabies and were transmitted to humans by cattle cats and oaks, respectively.
By genealogical comparison with other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, shrimp was considered the primary nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped infect humans by crossing the species barrier of the virus is unknown and the transmission pathway is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as viral carriers from skin to humans involving similar reconstitution with S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that Pangolin – a long-tune, formerly used in traditional Chinese medicine, ants-eating mammal found in SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin CoV – is a possible intermediate nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity.
However, the spread of the 1% difference in the entire two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, decisive results are awaited for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 5 days in artificial dry environments for 48 hours and less than 20 °C and at 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to radiation for 30 minutes at 56 °C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing pesticides, parasitic ammonia, chlorophores and other fat solvents can effectively deactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally has a lack of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore hypersensitive to the Novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been in relation to immunological transmission to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, after the virus has penetrated into the nutrient, it is first identified by the nutrient's energy-defense system from the identified identification receptors (PRR) including C-type lactin-like receptors, Tol-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
By various routes, the manifestation of viral infestation factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) induces which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the development of macrophase fagocytosis of viral specimens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, an optimized immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T leukocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific immunities and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-help cells produce donor-supporter cytokine to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Triple absorption resistance, including supplements and immunologists such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infection.
For example, immunities separated from recovered patients deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free particles that can result in severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst of cases, multiple failures and death.
Elderly people and pregnant women with the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by the onset in the flock are more likely to affect.
It is common that people who come into contact with a greater number of viruses or whose resistant functions meet are more likely to get infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period is very important for health authorities to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As is common practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus usually need a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19 which may not be accompanied by any symptoms or may include other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, numbness, headache, sore throat, insomnia, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic impairment and cogulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and patients with acute fever even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities should be examined for the virus in advance for timely diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for difficulty breathing and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were in two recent studies of flocks generated by transmission from family flock and asymptomatic individuals.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of these patients needed ventilation support and this corresponds to a higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) have been seen as major symptoms and approximately 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
By 14 February, the death rate for COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Comparatively, by November 2002, the SARS death rate was 10 percent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on the June 2012 demographic study.
A previous study that SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence gap (CI) of R0 5.71-7.23 while SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that the spread potential of SARS-CoV-2 is greater than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less fatal than the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than expecting MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The beginning in the flock is usually from the same family or the same group or vehicle like a cruise jet.
Patients may have a history of traveling or residing in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients within the last two weeks.
However, it has been that people can convey the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can convey the virus again, warning of increased quarantine time.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially leukocytes) in patients is normal or decreased.
For example, leukocyte cell counting &lt; 1×109/L including white blood cell counting &lt; 4×109/L with lymphopenia and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and toxicity were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased and the C-reducing protein and erythrocytes in the blood of most patients increased.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of D-dimer, increased and leucocyte cell count continued to decline.
Abnormalities in breast radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are reflected by bilateral spotted images or ground glass vagueness in the lungs.
Patients sometimes develop abnormal pneumonia, acute damage to the lungs and acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is seriously compromised due to uncontrolled intake, mass accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The anesthesia of type-I and type-II neoplasms reduces the background activation level and increases surface stress and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to flare and increases the risk of stopping the lungs from working.
Therefore, the worst findings of breast radiography are sometimes parallel to the most severe condition of the disease.
In the first disease-diagnostic analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020, the lungs of a patient who died of the disease were seen with newmossitis, hellenic membrane formation and porous leakage of Lyca cells, and polynomal polycentric cells that matched the pathology and ARDS of viral infections and were similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major parameter for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the epidemic, it was started to be used to diagnose clinical manifestations in China on February 13, 2020 (which was no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and radiological findings is necessary and indispensable for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zheng Group announced a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA partitions on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per input) using a depot without requiring any extensive equipment.
If clinical samples are verified, there is hope that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novell CoV, physicians may provide auxiliary care primarily to COVID-19 patients with various treatments previously used or proposed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological assistance.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies have stumbled into developing immunity and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially primarily invades the lungs and possibly also other organs in a small range, which express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, shortness of breathing and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is important to relieve symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and inbound mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be assisted by modified cardiopulmonary subway technology used in the treatment of extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), life-threatening heart disease or respiratory failure.
At the same time,ining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of excessive response of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine is a type of systemic donor response characterized by the release of cytokine series including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free particles that are the leading causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunodeficiency is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilisumab, IL6-anti-monoclonal immunizers, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinin storm include changes in T-cell-directed immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK inhibition; blinatomab; inhibitor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
The steroid as an immune suppressant, was widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of donor damage.
However, high doses of steroids in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients were not useful.
Instead, they can produce severe side effects, dramatically affecting disease diagnosis, especially non-vascular astiglins.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to use caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients with short-term corticosteroid procedures at the following moderate doses.
By the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, Remedsivir, a nucleotide analogue to be administered in a vein, has been found effective in an American patient of COVID-19.
Remedevir is a Novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remedsiver also demonstrated a potential blocking of other monocytic RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to perform two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
Simultaneously, baricitinib, interferon-α, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
There may be diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions after combined therapy with iopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other medicines used in patients of these treatments should be closely monitored.
Plasma and immune production from healed patients
There has been a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from suffering from the disease.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a higher level of immunity relative to the pathogen.
The immunities produced by B-lacca cells to fight pathogens and other external agents are immunoglobulin (Ig) and they identify the unique molecules in the pathogen and deactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and embedded in 10 severely ill patients.
With lower intake and viral load and better oxygen saturation in the blood, their symptoms improved within 24 hours.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are needed to suggest the method to be used on a wider scale.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, attention should be given to some plasma-related losses.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and generate cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of immunities in the blood usually remains low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is higher.
It is difficult to develop and produce such rapidly specific immunities to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to separate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic code that encodes effective immunities or to examine effective immunities to the essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of immunities.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in different formulas based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective ingredients are still unknown or useless because such ingredients or their optimal combination are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng G Du Capsules and Lion Hou Quing Wen Capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%) saw the highest recovery rates in treatment for COVID-19 in many provinces of China, while Hubei province, where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather thick comparison because many other influence factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatments and combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature in the WM+TCM group was remarkably lower than in the WM group only when it was necessary to get normal, go to symptoms and be hospitalized.
Most impressively, the WM+TCM group’s target deterioration rate (mild than severe) was remarkably lower (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the death rate was lower in the WM+TCM group (8.8% versus 39%) compared to the WM group alone.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaiting more controlled testing at larger levels and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to mark the system of actions and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 experience much more fear of highly contagious and fatal diseases and those quarantined also experience drowsiness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more discomfort and mental suffering.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological disorders were including continuous stress, discomfort, attacks of anxiety, psychopathic excitement, mental symptoms, bullying, and even suicide.
Finding compulsory contact and quarantine as part of public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks can make people more upset and angry about the effects of chickenpox, quarantine and chickenpox on their families and friends.
Therefore, COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who come into contact with them, as well as the general public, should be provided with mental health care.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health groups, clear communication with constant and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic machines and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
However, effective vaccines are needed to regulate the transmission from fertilizers and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics due to growing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent deactivating immune and/or defensive immunity against SARS-CoV.
Life-generated vaccines have been evaluated in the SARS biopharmaceutical patterns.
However, the vivo effectiveness of these vaccines and their protection against ionic virus infection in elderly people and in fatal challenging immunologies still have to be determined before any clinical trial begins.
This is probably because SARS gradually ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been since.
Conversely, due to the presence of ionic sources in the epidemic regions, MERS scattered cases and flocks continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using sub-units of passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanocores, virus-like particles, and reconstituent proteins, and some have been evaluated in replicas.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for individuals with non-resistant capacity is a vital task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long-term requirement (average 18 months) in the development of vaccines and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary to make disease-diagnostic compensation to prioritize their services for health care agencies, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on yet-informed clinical studies, the following factors may influence or be related to the disease diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the disease-diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred between the ages of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were over the age of 50, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and complications and were significantly older than those who did not expect them (51 versus the secondary age of 66), indicating age as a predictive factor in the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as stated above.
COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and restlessness.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with ACE2-positive collagenoids that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases have a deep correlation and can interfere with each other.
Unusual Laboratory Conclusion: The level of C-replicant protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of donation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a possible predictive factor for disease, response to medicine and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels with the severity of COVID-19 and disease diagnosis has also been suggested.
At the same time, increased lactate hydrogenation (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Key clinical symptoms: Radiography of the breast with other problems and the topical progression of clinical symptoms should be considered for prediction of the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
As mentioned above, steroid donors are immunostimulants commonly used as combination therapies in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular estrogen with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low doses and in COVID-19 patients for the short term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients suffered from extreme stress during the outbreak of COVID-19, as they often witnessed the long duration of quarantine and extreme uncertainty of the deaths of six and close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 differ from SARS.
In addition to making replications in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produces mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, like other CoVs that generate convulsions.
Therefore, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities in the early stages or in the incubation period with too many difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were much more ill, while most transmission did not occur during the initial stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
With the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including the lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire public.
Although these steps are drastically destroying the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a relapse of the epidemic.
The most optimistic prediction is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the relapse phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so promising.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19, which seems much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a prototype to predict the outcome of the epidemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 recovered and was identified in both the mid-turbine and throat feathers of patients who left the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the identified new virus could become a recurrent case like influenza.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on the lower number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Initially, it was predicted that there would be one million cases with half a million deaths from Ebola.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in contagion and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly contagious from coughing or stinging and from direct contact with materials potentially contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the stool, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from the stool.
A recent study of 138 cases that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with previously other diseases and 40 healthcare providers, were likely due to therapeutic infections.
Therefore, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients should also be very careful about protecting people who are standing next to or infected in contact with them.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series #1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent the drops of fluid from going into the air from a potentially infected person or sticking to the surface of things, from where they can go to others.
However, only N95 (Series #1860s) masks can prevent as small as 10 to 80 nm virions from entering the air; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can even cross a five surgical masks placed above one, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 (Series #1860s) masks, rather than surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers should wear insulation jerseys that fit to further reduce exposure to viruses.
The virus can infect a person even through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although she wore the N95 mask; it may have been the virus that entered her body through her donor eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent facial armor or glasses while working with patients.
The general public in the affected or potentially affected areas is strongly advised that everyone wash their hands with pesticide soap more often than normal, try to stay inside the house for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered a reasonable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as on 7 January 2020, due to its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV, it would have made China extremely cautious based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, by 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan’s Centers for Disease Control told citizens that the Novell virus has low human-to-human contagion and limited reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message relieved the public considerably of fear, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring and the delicate time came to limit the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be fairly cautious when making public announcements because every word matters to citizens and may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) remain more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from doctors or authorities; (3) be more committed to limiting potential epidemics to an early stage rather than trying to educate the public; and (4) pursue consistently targeted and effective practices to raise public awareness of the epidemic and periodically examine and improve the response system of society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 generated by the Novell virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and 50 other countries around the world to the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than young people than older people and women, and the severity and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic while SARS patients often do so when they become seriously ill, which creates much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several serious cases remain to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two scabies-like SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from scabies.
Original Nutrition, Suppose the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from skin to human was what?
Without finding out the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and there can never be a recurrence of the outbreak.
Although molecular replication and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and subsequently cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-only cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global epidemic, gradually ending like SARS, or continue to happen repeatedly like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the price was paid, we have no choice but to stop the soon-to-be epidemic and bring our lives back to normal.
Human coronavirus origins
Coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) have evolved alongside them over a period of thousands of years due to mutation and adaptation.
Prior to 2003, there were two human CoVs (HCoVs) known to generate mild diseases such as chokeberry.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection, completely reversing the situation.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to light and shocked us with more contagious capacity than its sister SARS-CoV but reduced pathogenicity.
HCoV infection is a pathogenic disease and understanding the pathogenic origin of HCoVs will come to our job.
Most HCoVs are derived from measles, in which they are non-infectious.
Some HCoVs also have information about intermediate cohsh nutrients.
In the prevention of human diseases, however, the identification of nutrients is directly inherent.
Examining the interactive actions of CoV-feeder in crops can also give important insights into the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information about seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of discovery as well as geogenized original and intranetic transmission.
Critically, we compare and see variations of different HCoVs from the perspective of progressive growth of viruses and gene reassembly.
Current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics are discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully change nutrients and the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the coronaviruses family which include a group of inhaled, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, were named “CoVs” due to the mucous-like form-science under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have non-sectional genomes whose structure is similar.
Approximately two-thirds of the genomes have two large over-sized reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicates polyprotein.
Polyprotein is further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many vein-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by the various veins of CoVs.
Depending on the variation in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the majority are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and have been sub-differentiated into its four ancestors (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that shrimp and weeds are genetic sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are major cohors of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually crossed species barriers and emerged as some important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms such as clotting and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, with a higher probability of acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS) and hypertensive manifestations, are relatively highly pathogenic in patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was separated from the nasal drain of patients with gout in the mid-1960s.
Since then, further information has been collected through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which generate self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 infected more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of 10% of unchecked cases is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak produced a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with the spread of other sights around the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the factor agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused 3,120 people to die and more than 91,000 people to become infected by March 3, 2020.
The warning bell is ringing and the world must be prepared for the upcoming outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are genetically derived from shellfish, rats or domestic flocks.
Numerous evidence supports the gradual growth from the skulls of all HCoVs, in which viruses are well-adapted and non-infectious, but show excessive genetic variation.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Exploring the genetically modified source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motivating power and binding factors of species proliferation.
This can guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2’s cohort, intermediate and enhancing nutrients with a significant impact on preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of HCoVs genetically originated, intra-energetic transmission and pathogenicity.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-infectious in their natural shell nutrients, but become pathogenic after intravenous transmission to new nutrients.
We will also review the trend of gradual growth of HCoV with an increase in contagion sometimes accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this perspective.
However, CoVs information is from the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E breed, which was first separated from the nasal outflows of patients with infected common gout, different CoVs were separated from many infected breeds including turkey, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified over the past decades.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lungs.
In 10–20% of cases, patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of choking, including headaches, scratches, illness and sore throat with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated by a gradual pathway into the brain of milk-drinking rats and by organ enhancement.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the infection generated by HCoV-229E, which is logically indiscriminate from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and are likely to be their primary transmission during the cold fall with the fast-paced season.
Typically, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, mild cystitis developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
In some patients with disabilities in immunity, severe infection of the lower respiratory tract appears.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia”, was the first well-documented epidemic in human history that caused HCoV and the trigger, the third HCoV, was discovered, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS could be marked in China’s Guangdong province in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic spread to many countries and continents, with 8,096 cases registered with 774 deaths.
In addition to the most disseminating ones, it was estimated that almost two secondary cases can increase due to each case with a gradual growth period of 4 to 7 days and a maximum viral impact appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience symptoms such as muscle pain, headache, fever, illness and colds, followed by shortness of breath, coughing and respiratory distress as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, short liver function examination and increased creatine cainage are common abnormalities associated with laboratory SARS.
Transmitted respiratory damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increases in macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, usually with cytokine storms, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be fatal especially for patients with immune disabilities.
The virus was first separated from the open biopsy of the lungs of the indicator patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially it was found to spread to young children, elderly and immune disabled patients with respiratory diseases.
In diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common.
In another independent study, the same virus was described as being separated from a nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is caused by about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its extreme occurrence occurs during the early summer, spring and cold autumn.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the inhibitory form-transmission, also known as cluster.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from an elderly 71-year-old man who was admitted to a hospital in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to communal pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been to be associated with severe hypertension.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found to cause mild respiratory diseases around the world.
These HCoVs found from all four communities have been well adapted in humans and are less likely to mutate to generate highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as in the rare case of a more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has led to recent reports of severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively communicate and maintain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases of imported cases with occasional secondary spread in close relationships have been in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS characterized by progressive severe pneumonia correspond to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has so far only been seen in MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to the end of 2019, a herd of pneumonia patients associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and has also named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a death rate of 3.4% of untreated cases.
Remarkably, the death rate of cases in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 produces severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
It is also seen in some patients.
Nymonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can grow rapidly as an acute respiratory crisis syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they come in different branches of the genealogy.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more contagious.
Symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Very interesting similarities and differences have been observed by comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs and looking at synergies.
First, the period of infection and the duration of the process of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and HCoVs obtained from four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are usually seen during transmission of community-acquired HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or without any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also sees forms characterizing both HCoVs acquired from the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the contagion of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the contagion of HCoVs obtained from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the contagion of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it progresses in humans such as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether the intravenous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see whether seasonal behavior can be similar to cases of HCoVs obtained from the SARS-CoV-2 community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including post-human infection, pathogenicity and persistent spread, will affect the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs obtained from all four communities that generate mild symptoms have been well adapted in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be correct that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both ancient HCoV viruses may have survived.
HCoVs that produce serious diseases in humans and those that develop serious HCoV diseases in humans have been eliminated.
To do so, the accumulation of adapted mutations that inhibit nutrient restriction factors must replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to fully adapt in humans.
If it gets well-adjusted, its transmission to humans will be difficult to prevent by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, CoVs obtained from four communities have been communicating to the human population, causing disabilities in immune patients.
These viruses do not need but cushions.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot beined.
They need to stay and spread in their fertilized shell and possibly find a chance to be spread to human targets that are absorbable by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and HCoVs obtained from four communities.
At least at present it is very contagious like HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs obtained from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and will be transmitted to humans of nutrients without any trainer or intermediary.
Before we discuss the origins of HCoVs, we will have a lot of work to do to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCoVs’ gradual development, natural, coaching, intermediate and enhancing nutrients.
Somebody is a gradually-growing nutrient of HCoV, if it shelters a very close ancestor with high similarity sharing at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The native virus is usually well-adapted and non-infectious in this nutrient.
Similarly, coshe nutrients shelter HCoV consistently and for a long time.
In both situations, the nutrients become naturally infected and are the natural nutrients of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around entry into humans, it does not adapt well to the new nutrient and is sometimes pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a genetic source of human infection and play the role of an enhancing nutrient by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and then passing it to humans to increase the level of human infection.
Any HCoV can go into an end-infection if it cannot keep its transmission within the intermediate nutrient.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also be optimized for intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes a natural shell nutrient.
Epidemiological-scientific figures predominantly showed that the indicative case of SARS had a history of contact with sporting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence examinations indicated that there was a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-anti-IgG in cattle traders than the general public expected.
In the markets of living animals, masked palm cylinders (Pagoma laurava) and racon dogs have been identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was after all of the markets were killed.
However, it has been that most of the masked palm seeds that did not come into contact with live but markets were SARS-CoV-negative in the wild or farm, suggesting that masked palm seeds may only be as serious as midsize-growing nutrients rather than as the natural shell of SARS-CoV.
Remarkably, since 80% of the Guangzhou markets are immunized against SARS-CoV in various breeds, these possibilities cannot be dismissed that many species of small mammals may also be intermediate enhancing nutrients of SARS-CoV.
These are the final nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of the natural but nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close-knit scalp called SARS-related rhinolophos scalp CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horse scalp.
These scabies are positive for the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-anti-immunologists and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other scabies CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that leeches are the nutrients of human pathogens that are emerging.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in scabies but none other than WIV1 has been isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the root of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from samples of carnivorous feces was demonstrated to use carnivorous, sewage and human ACE2 as a barrier for cellular entry.
Interestingly, the serum of healthy SARS patients was able to deactivate WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in scabies, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not the closest parent virus to SARS-CoV and that scabies are not the closest coshe nutrients to SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group of skulls CoV-HKU4 and skulls CoV-HKU5.
Scabies CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same nutrient grain, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral penetration.
MERS-CoV’s RNA-based RNA polymerases sequence is genetically close to the scabies beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild skulls.
MERS-CoV and its closest shell CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, shrimp may not even be the closest coconut nutrients to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that in many African countries, spotted ointments like nuts of Middle East origin are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivation immunities.
The living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was separated from the nasal folds of the frogs, indicating that the frogs are the authentic cochnutrients of MERS-CoV.
It is also remarkable that in experimentally infected nodes with MERS-CoV, excréments of the virus with usually mild symptoms but too much were seen.
Remarkably, infected ointments remove viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the excretory tract, which is also the main way of removing the virus from the veins.
However, questions are still present since there is no history of contact with eggs prior to the onset of many confirmed cases of MERS symptoms, possibly due to human transmission from humans or any unknown transmission pathways that include the species of organisms that hide MERS-CoV.
CoV-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide similarity with the SARS-CoV-1 RaTG13 shell separated from the rhinolophus species-associated scabies.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are sufficient to determine parental relationship.
That is, shellfish may not be the closest shell nutrient to SARS-CoV-2, unless near-similar shellfish CoVs are found in the future.
Possibly, the intermediate of SARS-CoV-2, but the nutrient Hunan, should be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of seafood that linked many early cases of COVID-19, an indicator of the human transmission event from potential crops.
Several recent studies based on metagynamic sequencing have suggested that a group of perishable small mammals known as PANGOLIN (Manis javanica) may also hide ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Angolin CoV genome share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are as closely related to RaTG13 with almost 90% similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in genetic ancestry, one of which shares a more similar gravel binding area (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino amino sequence similarity.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very varied despite genetic more sequential similarities.
The first study of sick pengolin also finding a group of viral excess DNA from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted several different matched methods and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence with a full length of 86.3% viral genomes.
We cannot deny the possibility that Pangolin is one of the intermediates of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct angolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and PANGOLINE SARS-CoV-2.
At the same time, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
It remains to establish the pathway for the gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in carcasses, pangolines and other mammals.
Where the most sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the most genomic-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very fictional idea that the excessive similarity between PANGOLINE SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the gradual development of selectively mediated injection.
An alternative proposal is in favour of the reintegration between PANGOLINE SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild species.
As the driving force of gradual growth, reconciliation is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest genetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the degenerated origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Genetic evidence has indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from scabies CoVs, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in yeast.
It has been that a close association has been observed with HCoV-NL63, of the skin called ARCoV.2 (Apple Chain Ridge CoV) found in North American three-color scales.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to another scabies called CoV, which was found in Ghana, although chemlids are also its suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, a summary of current information on the origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence of intra-energetic transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic insects around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was seen.
The history of the intra-energetic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs have been found relatively close to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha-CoV.
Many evidence support the transmission of the virus directly from the skin to humans.
Prior to this, humans did not come into contact with leeches in the shared ecological habitat of Alpaca.
Instead, humans are closely related to Alaska.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related scabies are varied and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV scabies, while alpha-CoV-infected scabies have seen an outbreak of respiratory disease.
Ultimately, alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpaca HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV can be obtained from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, scabies rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses and Henna viruses are the direct sources of human pathogenic viruses.
So it’s no more surprising that skulls can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where scabies alpha-CoVs are genetic pools of HCoV-229E, alpaca and scabies can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of energy transmission to humans from caterpillars and caterpillars.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from scabies is known on its primary identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that scabies provide an enriched foundation of viral species for energy exchange and energy transmission of genetic fragments.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interactions and excessive ability to fly are favorable conditions for the ideal “virus transmitter” of all spiders.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering coughing nodes for decades.
It has been well adapted to these nuts that have transformed from intermediate nutrients into stable and natural cohsh nutrients.
MERS-CoV generates a very mild disease andins a relatively low rate of mutation in these species.
It is a spotted transmission accident in humans and humans remain the final nutrients of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot beined.
Unlike the role of nodules in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of Pangolin in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, PANGOLINE beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in PANGOLINE.
They can be the ultimate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, such as cysts in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of intra-energetic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from organisms to humans have to be accepted or dismissed in future studies.
First, scabies can be the shell nutrients of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus that are roughly similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological housing with shrubs by killing or mining coal.
Second, Pangolin may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus has newly entered.
Humans become infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pet animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Immunologists in domestic and wild livestock require surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, the reconstitution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can take place in the third species with contact from both scabies and pengolines.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
In addition to the various types of butter nutritious, the three main factors related to viruses are also important in overcoming the species barriers of CoV by sensitivity.
First, their relatively higher rate of transformation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-celled RNA viruses, the estimated conversion rate of CoV with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacement per site 2 per year depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in the new feed can be considered to be “average” from “high”.
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonucleosis, whose disintegration can also lead to excessive variability and erosion or decreased viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is considered to inhibit the replication of CoV by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remedsivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents examined in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the conversion rate of CoVs is ten million times higher than that of their nutrients.
Also, the conversion rate is often higher when the CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation in humans.
Per, it has already been adapted to other nutrients closer to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV that has been well-adapted to coughing nodes.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will rapidly deactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA in the CoV puts extra plasticity on the genomic change for genomic modification and replication, thereby increasing the likelihood of intrinsic co-chronic development, which is beneficial for the emergence of Novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the abundant unique open reading frame and coded protein functions on the 3rd end of the genom.
Third, CoVs randomly change patterns over and over again during RNA replication by unique “copy-choice” function.
In nutrients acting as mixed characters, fat change often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely similar full-length and subgenetic RNAs, being reassembled, can generate new CoVs.
Genetic evidence of natural reintegration has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoVs such as shellfish SL-CoV and shellfish CoV-HKU9.
In connection with the transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors outlined above, viral interaction with nutrient grapefruit is another important factor affecting intravenous transmission.
Here, the re-accumulation of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive choices during intra-energetic transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of detoxificators between human and sick SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs with mutations on the RBD of specifically S-protein are thought to be more rapidly adapting to various nutrients.
Typically, RBD in a CoV’s S protein interacts with the cellular gray and is selected by the nutritional immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino element on the S1 section that binds to human ACE2 for viral entry as well as its counterparts.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 clients of various breeds including scabies, cows, rats and rabbit dogs, resulting in the intravenous transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino amino amino residues were seen in RBD separated from human and sickle viral clusters, and 4 of them are located in the grass-bound nuclei for interaction with ACE2 grass.
The RBD of sewage SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 gray.
In other words, these two amino amino substitutions can be important in the optimization of viruses in humans.
It is remarkable that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular gene as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the binding similarity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, Crio-EM studies indicate 10 to 20 times more attractiveness of this joint than expected between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-invitation will be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a separate part of S.
A number of other HCoV grains exist, such as Aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated cylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after energy transmission from their animal nutrients.
The result of the intra-energetic transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restrictive factors, in addition to cellular grease.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and the natural coral nutrients of HCoVs, such as shellfish, shellfish and mosquitoes, can hinder energy transmission.
Successful intra-energetic transmission of HCoVs requires suppressing nutrient dependence factors and reversing nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, it remains to identify and describe molecular determinants in this critical area of virus-carrier interaction.
Using CRISPR’s latest technology, non-pathological genomic testing of SARS-CoV-2’s nutritional dependence and restrictive factors can be fruitful.
Revival of Novel HCoVs: Return to the original base
The variety of shell CoVs provides sufficient opportunities for the promotion of Novel HCoVs.
In this sense, shellfish act as the genes of CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutation and genetic reintegration also lead to the development of HCoV and two important stages in this process work.
For example, Novell has the ability to alter the viral analogues of the acquisition or loss of protein-coding genes much more.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related measles viruses were separated, but found to encode various ORF8 proteins.
The characteristic 29-nucleotide decomposition of SARS-CoVs has been found in separated breeds at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This disintegration breaks down ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation modification that promotes cell transformation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential history of reintegration with alpha- and gamma-CoVs herbivores, with a very large number of small reintegration areas identified in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced reintegration events among different herbivores, which occurred in swallowed nuts in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reintegration events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs reintegrate with other but CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause unintended changes in viral genomes, possibly due to elective drug-free viruses, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide decomposition.
While HCoV-229E-related scabies and ointment viruses can be observed in exotic ORF4, alpha-CoV shows single nucleotide entry, resulting in frame shifts.
Last but not least, the gradual growth of Novell HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of elections in their cohosh nutrients.
Symptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when the scabies were infected with CoVs which indicates mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the scabies.
It seemed that the skulls were structurally and physically well adapted to the CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the vesicles, effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the preventive nature-death cell activity in skin cells is suppressed due to the regulation of the natural-death cell provider NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the major tissue conformity complex category I molecules.
In addition, the higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from the more digestive activity of germs can suppress the replication of CoV and affect proof reading by exoribonucleosis, thus providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when entering new nutrients.
More pathogenic CoV breeds may also develop by reintegration, resulting in new protein or protein properties obtained for nutritional optimization.
Therefore, it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-infectious in shell nutrients such as shellfish and ointment or produce mild symptoms.
Without showing strong nutrient-resistant reactions, they strongly replicate.
It hides the rule of why symptomless carriers are seen and what causes serious cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic conductors, the immune response is separated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of separating the immune response can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon reaction is especially acute in the veins.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in vesicles is defective.
By this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory syndrome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common theme that produced SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where 95% nucleotide similarity has been observed with SARS-CoV of scabies beta-CoV, there is also 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2 of scabies-CoV.
While seals and other herbs in the markets have been seen sheltering SARS-CoV-like viruses, the closest intermediate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found Pangolin beta-CoVs, suggesting that Pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or contribute to the gene fragments in the final version of the SARS-CoV-2 of Pangolin beta-CoVs.
Though questions remain, there is no evidence found that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately created or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have been discussed due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in shellfish and other animals has changed a lot in our understanding of HCoVs in fertilized original and standard transmission.
Different evidence has been seen that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are primary scabies and are transmitted to humans by intermediate nutrients.
Given that SARS-CoV infection occurs due to contact between humans and swallows in markets, closing wet markets and killing swallows there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, because of the discovery of numerous herbivores of PANGOLINE beta-CoVs quite close to SARS-CoV-2, PANGOLINE should be removed from the Weight Market to prevent geodetic transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by Pangolin and other mammals and how it is remains to be clarified in future examinations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering coughing nodes for decades.
These wines are important means of transportation for locals as well as major sources of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to abandon all nuts to control MERS as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for tumors in combination with other infection control measures to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genes may emerge in the form of prototypes to generate outbreaks.
Various geodetic CoVs are roaming in wild creatures.
Particularly, leather CoVs with geodetic capacity are very diverse.
It is highly likely that these genetically-generated CoVs will have labor growth and reintegration, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that will be more contagious and/or fatal to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and cattle, wild cattle in some regions of China should abandon the culture of eating.
With the harsh examination of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plans should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been present on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural shell until there is no chance of spreading.
Although measles have many characteristics that help spread viruses, if people are educated about staying away from measles, the likelihood of human contact with them and other wild species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will prove useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral malignancy is to stay away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of human malignant viruses.
Many organs of the puzzle of the genetically originated origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if scabies transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the Pangea, it will be interesting to see under what conditions the scabies and the Pangea can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if skulls play a direct role in human transmission, then it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with skulls.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, skulls, and penguins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic mammals, can become susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be done.
Whether it’s scabies, pangolines, or any other mammal, it’s expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continuing research in this area will clarify the gradual development paths of SARS-CoV-2 in herds with significant effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria of COVID-19's "suspicious cases" and "determined cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team published the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Quick Consultation Guidelines, and this guideline provides the appropriate context for our experience and the fight against this epidemic worldwide.
Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest clinical criteria for “suspicious cases” and “defined cases” in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (Seventh Edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named hyperacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO marked COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a Quick Consultation Guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China has released a total of seven editions of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) with fundamental changes in some contexts.
Now being commented by Zhou et al. on our guidelines, they have presented a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also provided valuable references to this epidemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, a comprehensive analysis requires combining any item of the epidemic history with two items of clinical manifestations, or if there is no clear epidemic history, it requires meeting three items of clinical manifestations:
Epidemic history: (1) history of travel or residence to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or breathing symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (case ≥ 2 cases and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflected features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal, narrowed or low lymphocytes in the initial stage.
Confirmed case diagnosis should be based on a suspicious case with any of the following elements of pathogenic or interchangeable evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 comes positive; (2) a viral overall genomic sequence showing a higher similarity to known Novel coronavirus; (3) a serum test coming positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM immunity and IgG immunity; or a positive change from SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG immunity to negative, or an increase of ≥ 4 times in the health care phase compared to the estimated acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic algae in respiratory systems or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serial evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments were based on the ongoing work of researchers, who explore respiratory system samples including an optimal nucleic embryo identification kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as blood samples, thereby increasing the availability of various samples, and support bringing specific immune positive outcomes to confirmed standards.
Furthermore, there are many evidence that reminds us to be careful with uncompromising targeting and reflecting patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.’s flow chart should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as a “female risk”.
The score system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest exploring and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update their guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new deaths from COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the highest single-handed figure ever
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
This is the largest number of deaths from this virus in a single day so far.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) the number of recorded infectious cases, including 114 active cases and 33 people who recovered from the disease while living at home.
So far, 17 records have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirazadi Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two patients were aged over 60, two between 51 and 60 and one between 41 and 50.
He also said that there were two deaths.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global epidemic.
A hospital official told a local news center, Anadolu Agency, that the deceased was named Jalal Safir Rahman, who was a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission and was taking care of him at the Kuwait Friendly Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s road transport and bridge minister, Ubbad Qader, said that road traffic will be shut down for longer than previously planned until next Saturday.
This public transport ban began on March 26 and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of necessary things such as medical goods, fuel and food was not stopped.
Early cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two people and one of them who returned from Italy on March 8.
On March 19, they were all three well.
More than 1 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide
Statistics from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million.
Coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 is linked to at least 52,000 deaths.
On the day that this figure crossed, the first coronavirus infection in Malawi and the first coronavirus deaths in Zambia were on the same day.
North Korea claimed that by Thursday it was among the few countries that are still free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization has 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases that occurred in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on 4 April, according to the Central European Commission.
More than 2 million 44 thousand cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, and have resulted in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted figures from Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 deaths from the coronavirus infection in the United States occurred on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced even tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the lockdown in the city to May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to receive pay without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted against extending the national emergency for 15 days; the proposal passed by 215 votes, ten members were absent and one voted against it.
Saudi Arabia has placed forty-thousand-hour warning in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the first warning was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand has planned to plant crops from 10 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike Dwayne has announced that the order to stay at home alone in the state has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia decrease the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, the Australian store series Woolworth and Cole limited the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once in all their stores nationally to two and one packages, respectively.
ALDI also imposed a single-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on check-out sites and on series’ Facebook pages.
It is that buyers were shopping together for the situation in which they needed to keep themselves separate due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the limit of buying toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Before these changes, Woolworth and Coles had imposed a ban on purchasing a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in his March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban coming into effect, “stocks are still running out within an hour of delivery in many stores,” and said this demand was unprecedented, while ALDI said it was “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesman for Woolworth, there was a “significant boost” in sales last week.
The Costaco store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered suppliers and larger packages and also increased the duration of delivery.Wallworth ordered additional stocks, while ALDI raised stocks to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available soon.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers should try to increase stock, but it becomes difficult to do so due to restrictions imposed by the local council on timely delivery of trucks.
In a situation where suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has already decreased, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released in advance, some stores could not operate Wednesday Special.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill stocks every night.
He explained that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in large numbers, and then, when the whole stock is sold, the large shelves behind are released empty, causing the feeling of decline to become harder.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, “Colls and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitary could be bought and present in large quantities, the waste could possibly be reduced.”
Producer of recycled toilet paper, Hu Gies A Crap, said last Wednesday that his stock has ended.
According to News.com.au’s report, Clinic Toilet Tissue Making Company Zhiberly-Clark and Sorbent Making Company Solaris Paper insist that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com that in Melbourne, where less auctions are being held due to shoppers celebrating holidays on the long weekend of the working day, some property sellers are giving free toilet paper to the first bidders in the auction.
In the Thursday edition of a daily, NT News printed in Darwin, there was an eight-page insert that was given to be used as cutting toilet paper.
According to a March 3 Australian report, ABC was initially unwilling to impose stores restrictions; in the report, he said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry things, handwashes and powder.
Similarly, outside of Australia, a two-pack limit of 12 rolls was also imposed on the purchase of Andrew’s toilet paper in the online British supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global epidemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of the coronavirus SARS CoV-2 disease COVID-19 a global epidemic.
While the term “global epidemic” means only how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to act.
“All countries can now change the path of this global epidemic.
If countries identify disease in its response, treat patients, keep them distinct, trace them and unite them,” said Tedros Adanom Gabriasis, WHO Director-General.
“We are extremely concerned by both the worrying level of spread and severity and the worrying level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global epidemic is “an outbreak.”
In comments published by CNN in February, he said, “The detection of any respiratory virus other than influenza has not gone from sustained global spread.”
Gabriel also expressed something similar when he said, “We haven’t seen a global coronavirus epidemic so far.”
He continued, “And so far we have not seen a global epidemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
This new degree of global epidemic was given in January following the WHO’s decision to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fochie, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said about the outbreak, “One of a hundred things, it’s going to get worse.”
The Associated Press that by Thursday there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic is a ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and declared an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China has been estimated to be 4%, while globally it ranges from 13,04% in Algeria to 0,08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory crisis syndrome.
The time from getting exposed to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be two to fourteen days.
It has no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is targeting and auxiliary therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from other people and monitoring and self-imaging for those who suspect being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, quarantines, workplace hazard controls and facility shutdowns.
This epidemic has generated severe global socio-economic inequality, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and has led to widespread shortages in supplies from people’s upset shopping.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and shape, and others from areas with more viral cases.
Lower travel and heavy industry shutdowns have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of the Hubei province) of China mass cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the wholesale market of Hunan seafood and therefore the virus is considered to have a genetically modified origin.
The outbreak spreading virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to scabies coronavirus, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Later on December 1, 2019, the first known person with symptoms discovered illness, and that person had no visible association with the subsequent meat market group.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases in December 2019 were linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post that one case was a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei on November 17, 2019, which could be the first case.On February 26, 2020, the WHO that with a decrease in new cases in China, there has been a sudden rise in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
Especially in people with mild symptoms, very few cases may have been.
By February 26, relatively few cases were among young people, including those aged 19 years and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Walens, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before obtaining effective group immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people in whom COVID-19 has been tested, and according to the official protocol whose test positive has been confirmed.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the cases.
The initial estimate of the original reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, COVID-19 had caused the deaths of 97,000 people.
In China, by February 5, 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The official calculation of deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic generally refers to those who were found to be positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be very high, because it may not include people dying without testing such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial statistics from Italy found that the number of additional deaths occurring during the epidemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID deaths.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that “we know that [the so-called death toll] has been newly estimated,” a statement backed by descriptive reports of low-calculation in the United States.
The first deaths outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
By March 13, deaths were in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the early outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-malaria ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) by 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In China, the estimated death-to-malnutrition ratio has dropped from 17.3% (for those in whom symptoms started 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those in whom symptoms started after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people who die from a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people who die from an infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) disease.
These figures are not timed and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific cults.
The University of Oxford Center for Avidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this limit is consistent with the results of a statistical study analyzing the effects of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany and the effect of the test on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims the epidemic can be controlled.
The extreme and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Mackey Bonnie of Penn State University said, “When left uncontrolled, infectious outbreaks generally become stable and begin to decrease when nutrients are not available for the disease.
But when it will happen, it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions about it right now.”
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that “it could end by June” if all countries follow the WHO’s advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kouchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “possibly will be circulating for one or two years.”
According to a study by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, making physical distances and other measures would be necessary “until a vaccine is available (possibly: 18 months or more”).
William Sheffner of Wenderbilt University said, “I don’t think it’s likely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, because it’s so easily transmitted” and it could “transform into a stroke disease, which comes back every year.”
The upsurge of returning will depend on the limit of group immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be sclerotic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cache), reduced sense of smell, shortness of breath, pain in muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, colds, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea or nylima. According to the WHO, one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips; urgent medical care is recommended when these symptoms are present. Further development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory crisis syndrome, sepsis, septic trauma and death.
Some of the infected people may be sclerotic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm the infection, so researchers have issued a recommendation that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to overcome the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the exposure ratio ranges from some to 44%.
The normal period of infection (the time between the infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is most commonly five days.An example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and subsequently decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly by small drops generated during close contact and during coughing, scratching or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that drops can go from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (27 ft) without coughing the mouth.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small drops generated while speaking that last longer in the air. Breath drops can also occur while breathing out, including while speaking, although the virus is not normally aerated.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of those who are nearby or possibly into the lungs by breathing.
Some medical procedures such as pipeline propensity and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to impaired respiratory secretion and thus aerated spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it can spread through the stool, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before and in the subsequent stages of the disease.
Tests have come positive for people's disease three days before the onset of symptoms, which indicates that transmission is possible before critical symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed detection cases are present, but detection transmissions have been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other individuals.
In particular, the virus was found detectable on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.Tests for pet animals and other animals have come positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can pass from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as is done after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an innovative virus that was first separated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of Novell SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature.Out of the human body, the virus dies from domestic soap, which breaks down its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that this is the virus of the genetic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically part of the group of beta-coronavirus, the serpentine serpentine virus (Vaginal B) with two scabies-producing breeds.
This is 96% similar to other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino element difference in some parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from the penguins and the viruses from humans.
Compared to the entire genomes so far, the normal genetic content between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found at a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to promote intermediate nutrients to the pangolines.
Temporary infection by the virus can be identified based on symptoms, although confirmation eventually comes from reverse transcription polymerase series indication (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is considerably more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with many of its image characteristics being similar to other mumonies and disease processes.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that “CT should not be used as a primary test to examine or diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase series indication (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is done on the nasopharyngeal phase, but a neck phase can also be used.Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect immunodeficiency.
By 6 April 2020, none of these has proven to be accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Analytical image characteristics on targeted people's radiography and computed tomography (CT) include unapproved peripheral ground glass ambiguities and absent pulmonary discharge.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, without confirmation by PCR, the specificity of imaging in identifying COVID-19 is limited.
A large study in China compared breast CT results to PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to explore viral imaging properties with both radiography and CT.
To prevent the transmission of disease, strategies includeining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or scratching into a tissue and putting that tissue directly into the garbage can.
People who may already have an infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to make physical distances to prevent transmission are also recommended.Many governments have banned or advised all unnecessary entries to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they were infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and protect their eyes. Contacting health authorities is an important way to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have increased due to the use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and by 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log proximity to another user’s phones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with a person who came into contact with a COVID-19 test positive. Misconceptions about ways to prevent infection are spreading; for example, rubbing the nose and mouthwashing is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after spraying, coughing or splashing the nose.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
Additionally, the CDC has recommended the use of at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several solutions including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropionol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidon-iodine (within a minute of exposure to the pesticide on the surface of a stainless steel).
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at an office or daycare facility, all areas such as offices, toilets, public spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controllers, and ATMs used by sick people, etc., should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses by turning their elbows or with a tissue when coughing or coughing and then deal with any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount of drops out of the breath and the distance to be fixed when speaking, scratching and chewing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing masks can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hygiene of the hands.”
The WHO has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of facial masks by ordinary individuals.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical facial masks made of clothes.China has especially recommended the use of treatable medical masks by general healthy people, especially when they come into close contact with other people (1m (3ft) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make clothes face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public places without wearing masks or hiding the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear facial masks when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has banned everyone entering the grocery store from wearing a face mask.
Israel has urged all citizens to wear facial masks when going to public spaces.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear facial masks on railways and cross-city buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, while making a home-made face mask is also recommended for those who can’t buy a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) involves infection control functions that aim to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel bans; and shutting down schools, workshops, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact applause, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandatory or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in any region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public population of more than two people. Elderly adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and the horizontal immune system are at higher risk of serious diseases and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbursts. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "build social distance" with "build physical distance", in order to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact whileining either virtual or remote.
The use of the term "Social Distance" imply that people should adopt complete social separation rather than encourage them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during epidemics.
These include recommendations to have sex only with the person who lives with you, who does not have symptoms of viruses or viruses.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected are recommended for self-imaging at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-formation.Many governments have mandatory or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine guidelines have been issued in high-risk groups.
People who may have come into contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last potential risk.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are constriction or suppression, and shamanism.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as implementing other measures and vaccination to control the infection in order to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts go to a state of calm: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
The combination of the two measures can be done at the same time.
More extreme measures are needed to suppress, so that the epidemic can be reversed by reducing the original number of reproductions to 1.A part of managing the outbreak of a infectious disease is to try to reduce the extreme range of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic loop.
This reduces the risk of extreme health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-collective interventions that can manage the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks on the face and self-quarantine; intended community measures to create physical distance such as shutting down schools and canceling collective assembly programs; community participation to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as surface cleaning such as environmental measures are intended.
Other countries have also adopted several types of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has launched large-scale investigations and localized quarantines, and issued warnings on the voices of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of facial masks and punished the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and America show that there are major challenges in shamanism (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the disease) and suppression (reversing the development of the disease).
Optimum sanitation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but even after these hundreds of people die and health systems become extreme.
Suppression may be given priority, but it needs to beined as long as the virus is spreading into the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is first), otherwise the transmission from delay in measures returns rapidly.
Long-term intervention to suppress the epidemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been approved, but development efforts, including testing of existing drugs, are ongoing.
Taking cold-chill medications without a prescription, drinking liquids and relaxing can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The results of using steroids can be worse.
Many compounds that are pre-approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of their COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some “conventional and home remedies” can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients and optimizing health care has been described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and WHO’s European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources at multiple levels to hospitals and primary health care services, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures whenever possible, segregating and segregating COVID-19-infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There is not much about where the first case (so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of Novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the wholesale market of Hunan seafood, where live seeds were also sold, and one thing is not that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of genetically modified origin. The unknown cause of pneumonia group was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Zhixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Wuhan Jiangang CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Accused of spreading false rumors, the police warned eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, and another doctor, I Feng, was fired by their seniors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Health authorities in Wuhan were notified of numerous cases of unknown pneumonia, which resulted in inspections started in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every half seven days.
In the early and mid-January of 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year's rally and Wuhan Transportation Center and major rail exchanges.
On January 20, China registered about 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official figures show that by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. By 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the number of most confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the epidemic in Europe, many countries in the Shenzhen region have restricted free movement and established border controls.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to enforce the transport restriction in Wuhan, WHO Representative Guden Galia commented that while “certainly not recommended by the WHO” it was “a very important sign of commitment to curb the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated” and said it was “unprecedented in public health history”.On 30 January, after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of other cases, the WHO declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), which is the sixth PHEIC since it was first remedied during the 2009 swine flu epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the cause of PHEIC was “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems.”
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that “there is no reason for such measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and traffic.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed for a $675 million contribution to strategic preparations in low-income countries from the global community, citing the need to help countries that “have not established systems to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was emerging.”

On February 14, a joint mission team led by the WHO with China, to assist in domestic management and host workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions, was activated in China to assess "the severity and contagion of the disease" and "to visit the region to assess the impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural systems," to provide ground rights to international and WHO experts in China. On February 25, the WHO announced that "the world should make more efforts to prepare for a possible coronavirus epidemic," saying that although it would be very urgent to say the epidemic right now, countries should remain in a "stage of becoming wary."
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation.On February 28, WHO authorities said the global coronavirus threat assessment would be from “high” to “very high”, which is the highest level of caution and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that “this is a reality check for every government on earth: it’s time to wake up.”
This virus may be coming in its way and you need to be prepared,” insisting that the right response measures can help the world avoid “it’s worst.”
Ryan further said that current statistics have not persuaded public health authorities to declare a global epidemic, saying such a announcement would mean “we are essentially accepting that every human on Earth will come into contact with that virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The general director said that the WHO was "deeply concerned by both the dangerous level of spread and severity and the dangerous level of inactivity."WHO has faced great criticism as an inadequate management of the epidemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as an epidemic.

The Chinese government of the United States to deal with the epidemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei, the British Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, have criticized.
Several provincial-level administrators of China’s Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed to deal with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institution’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhou Ligian, rejected a previous acknowledgment of a coronavirus outbreak beginning in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus” or “vuhan virus,” saying that China’s “control system has now turned a virus into a global epidemic,” which some critics consider to be misleading to racism and “the failure of their administration to prevent disease.”
The Daily Best received a U.S. government wire, which outlines a communication barrier with a clear origin in the National Security Council, quoting the strategy as “Everything is about China.”
“Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of the campaign to increase its global impact.

On March 22, following a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment.
Italy’s La Stampa newspaper quoted an unnamed “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s aid was “unnecessarily or very little used by Italy.”
The source accused Russia of “sub-political and diplomatic” deception.
Lombardy President Atilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed media reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia has sent medical aid material to the United States from a cargo aircraft.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering assistance to U.S. allies [Putin] believes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical devices and materials increase production, they will also be able to pay off if necessary.”
The largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercise will be held at a low level.
Secretary-General for Nuclear Destruction Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of soldiers of the United States and many European countries, but also the residents of the participating countries where they are working.”
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, calling for help, stating that their country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to its failure to access international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran.This outbreak has prompted the U.S. to adopt social policies equally in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect the chances of re-election of Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.The diplomatic relations worsened due to the epidemic between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "unclear and passive quarantine efforts" when Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at locations designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially stunned by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for the Moon’s epidemic, claiming the government has mismanaged the outbreak, or praised its response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that it could help governments strengthen their hold on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely, suspended elections along with parliament and punished those found dealing with the virus and crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for many examples of lack of supply, arising from the use of tools to fight the outbreak globally, fear-driven shopping, and disruption in factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supplier regulations.
Many areas also witnessed a fear-driven shopping situation, causing shelves to lack essential food items such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, leading to a decline in supply.
In particular, the technology industry has been warned about delays in the transport of electronic goods.
According to the general director of the WHO, Tedros Adenom, the demand for personal safety equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in normal prices up to twenty times, as well as delays in the supply of medical products for four to six months.
This has caused a shortage of personal safety equipment worldwide, which is why the WHO has warned that it will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the epidemic gave Digue shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
This activity caused a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.In spite of the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the high demand for food products, both sectors are surviving a severe shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the looting and illicit trade of critical products have been successful, defending against the unexpected shortage of food that was predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decline in its significant agricultural output, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were also only temporarily seen in the city of Wuhan, when Chinese government officials released stockpiles of sugar-meat to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make food producers mandatory to store for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has been damaged: According to a media report on March 16, government measures to stop the spread of the virus, and a 20.5% drop in retail sales, have hurt the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the outbreak of the virus has been considered a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clear picture of potential outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could be greater than the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimated an impact of $300+ billion on the global supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly “struggled” after the sharp drop in oil prices due to the decline in demand from China.

On February 28, Scop Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s authentic creditworthiness determination, but retained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on coronavirus fears, the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many people believe in the possibility of an economic downturn.
Economist Mohammad Al-Arian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and states in time.
Central banks are responding faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most badly affected areas due to traffic restrictions, government advice to shut down public destinations including tourist attractions, stop any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas have cancelled flights due to low demand, while British Regional Airlines has collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the most seen so far.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The time of this epidemic also coincides with the major travel sessions associated with the Chinese New Year holidays, the time of Cheryun.
Large numbers of events, including annual New Year’s celebrations, have been cancelled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies independently shutting down their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions in Beijing have been shut down to prevent collective celebrations including Forbiden City and traditional temple mails.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10, instructing most workshops not to reopen until that date.
These areas represented 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to its highest and declared an emergency, with schools shut down until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations.The retail sector has been affected globally, with stores shrinking or temporarily shut down.
Retail sales visits in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
Compared to February, there was a 33-43% drop in people walking to shopping centers in March.
Worldwide shopping mall operators have taken additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling ceremonies.According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the downturn driven by the epidemic could leave 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who would not be in that situation without the epidemic.
In January and February 2020, during the extreme epidemic in Wuhan, 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck in homes in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
The outbreak of the coronavirus could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could fall to 32% according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Millions of migrant workers in India have become unemployed due to lockdown (which is paid through daily wages). A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the universal loan scheme.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The field of performance arts and cultural heritage has been much more affected by the epidemic, which has affected the operations of organizations worldwide as well as individuals working and independently.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector have endeavored to maintain their (price: publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to the community,ining the safety of their employees and the public and, where possible, supporting artists.
By March 2020, worldwide and in different records, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, ceremonies and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Recently, another and rapidly growing outcome of disease is the cancellation of religious services, major functions of sports, and other social functions, such as music functions and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption.The Vatican announced that the Holy Week observations in Rome, which take place during the last week of Lent's Christian Tribulation session, have been cancelled.
Many bishops-districts have recommended elderly Christians to stay at home instead of being massively present on Sunday; some churches have provided church services through radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic bishops-region of Rome closing its churches and chapels and emptying Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish chapels, temples and temples and restricted public ceremonies.
Iran’s Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and subsequently closed hotspots, while Saudi Arabia also banned entry of foreign travellers as well as civilians to sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The epidemic has created the most important arrangement in the game calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sports events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season, and 2019–20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak interrupted the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be “re-defined on a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summers of 2021”.
This is why many gamblers are adopting online methods, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the rates of new subscriptions.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling music shows.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway people, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have been exploring ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as making live streaming of music programmes or web-based “smaroches” to perform, distribute and promote artists’ work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet moms have spread as humour and confusion among uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, growing biases, xenophobia and racism have been noted towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people with hotspots in Europe, America and other countries.
Events of fear, suspicion and hostility have been seen in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In reports since February (when most cases were still limited to China), racist feelings of Chinese people in various groups around the world who deserve to get the virus or get justified punishment have been documented.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, the people of the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 can also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent this disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan spread on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have rising levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” which was regarded by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign elected people from Wuhan to Novgorod.
Students from northeastern India, whose border is with China, who study in major Indian cities have allegedly experienced persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Indian People's Party in West Bengal, Dalip Khalifa, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "therefore God has avenged them."
Later, the Chinese commercial embassy in Kolkata condemned the comment, calling it "mistaken."In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents were promoted by an epidemic, describing foreigners as being targeted for "foreign garbage" and "displacement".
Several newspapers with Powells removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their findings on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods to detect the presence of the virus and to detect the immunities produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immuno-detection (hemodialysis) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Tests of immunologists show how many people have become ill, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this examination, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective resistance in people can be determined.
Due to limited checks, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people.
By March 23, no country had checked more than 3% of its population and how many countries have checked, there are considerable disparities on this.
This inequality is also likely to significantly affect the death rate of cases, which in some countries is likely to be remarkably more predictable.
Using real-time reverse transcripting polymerase channel reaction (rRT-PCR), breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal feathers or mold samples, can be checked.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests with throat feathers are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people checked in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airway from the inside by a sucking catheter or the nicotine material (bubble) can be used in coughing.
One of the initial PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase channel reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed the check kit until 23 January 2020. South Korean company Coganbiotech developed a clinical category, the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 check kit (power-check coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It explores the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specifically found in SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 check kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is delivering its 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories by the International Resistance Corps.
The older versions of the check kit had unsuccessful results due to faulty examiners in one of three genetic examinations, and problems arose in the check at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to the average of samples successfully processed in the entire February 2020 being less than 100 samples a day.
Inspections using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020 and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start inspections.
The inspection was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. US professional laboratories began inspection in early March 2020.
By March 5, 2020, Labcorp announced the country-wide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available nationwide until March 9, 2020.
No quantity estimates have been announced; samples must be collected and processed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, this inspection was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On March 12, 2020, it was to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection in the Mayo Clinic. On March 13, 2020, Rush Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for a high-volume inspection that could be carried out within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 inspections in a 24-hour period from a machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authority (EUA) to the Abbott Laboratories to inspect Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holographics, Laboratories, and Thermofisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, in the same way, Sheffield received an EUA for an examination from the FDA that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase production to 50,000 checks every day. A test kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal immunity that connects specifically to Novell coronavirus' nucleocapside protein (N protein), with the hope that this could result in 15 to 20 minutes like an acute influenza check.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that “early breast radiography has less clinical significance, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
The distinctive characteristics of CT include bilateral multi-volume ground-glass specifications with peripheral, uncompromising and posterior distribution.
As the disease grows, the effects of subplural, crazy paying and concentration develop.
The source point of the current epidemic, a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that with many of the imaging characteristics of CT being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes, despite being less specific, it is remarkably more sensitive than PCR.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as a screening or first-line screening for diagnosis of COVID-19.”
Part of the resistant response to infection involves the production of immunities including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine resistance that starts in individuals 7 days after or around the onset of symptoms and to detect infection in order to monitor people.Tests can be checked in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to see the resistant response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from a skin scrub.
The first withdrawal step of testing other than PCR methods is not required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided the agency with information when needed and thus are now able to distribute their immunity checks.
By 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority.At the end of March 2020, Euromedical Laboratory Diagnostics and Apptop Diagnostics received European approval for its test kits that can detect IgG and IgA immunities to viruses in blood samples.
It has the ability to examine hundreds of samples within a few hours and therefore it is considerably faster than traditional PCR testing of viral RNA.
Immunodeficients can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK found that any immunodeficiency check kit purchased by them was not good enough for use.
Hong Kong has planned where suspicious patients can stay at home, “the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube”, they will return to it and receive the results of the investigation shortly.The British NHS has announced that they are starting plans to check at home for suspicious cases, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or eliminates the risk of disinfecting the used ambulance.
Drive-True inspection centers have helped make the fastest, most comprehensive inspection from any country in South Korea.In Germany, the National Association of Statuary Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that their ambulance settings had the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 inspections per day and had 10,700 inspections in the past week.
When the order of the examination is given by the doctor, the cost is charged by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Coach Institute, Germany’s total capacity is 160,000 checks per week.
Driving-thru checks until March 19 were offered in many major cities.
By 26 March 2020, the total number of checks carried out in Germany was not known, as only positive results were.
The first laboratory survey observed that by week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples, including week 12/2020, were examined and 33,491 (6.9%) of the samples were tested positively for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Tecnian and Rembum Hospital combined samples and, if the combined sample is found positive, further examined, developed and tested a method for examining samples from 64 patients together. In Wuhan, a 2000 square meter temporary emergency discovery experiment named "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye") by BGI was launched on February 5, 2020, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With construction overseeing by BGI’s founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has seen that if the ability to check it wasn’t initiated, the number of cases in Hubei would be 47% higher and the related cost of dealing with quarantine would double.
The Wuhan Laboratory has been immediately followed by Hoo-Yen laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 inspections per day.Multi-scale open source frameworks have been released by Oriogame Ace that can test samples of up to 1122 patients of COVID19 using 93 tests.These balanced frameworks can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic fluid handle.
Prior to March, deficiencies and insufficient amounts of excipients became a problem in large-scale inspections in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore protocols for sampling that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing its population for coronavirus at a rate per capita more than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of control to reach a larger level of population.
This was due to the combination of drive-thru checking capability and the purchase of population-scale mass-thru laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency checking laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to test thousands of RT-PCRs per day and is the first laboratory in the world to work on such a large scale outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany’s method for building kits to develop low-income countries with a lack of resources.
Germany’s method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Gynecology Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed the availability of tests in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak, there were problems with the reliability of the test kits between China and the U.S. and they were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts in the country and Australia.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of screening in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the Novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in private sector laboratories, have been developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing screening programmes is the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 epidemic.The increased demand for screening due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused thousands of overpriced screening in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of chemical analysts has become stressed.
In March 2020, China accuracy problems in its survey kits.
In the United States, the check kits developed by the CDC had a “commy”; the government then removed the labor barriers that were preventing private inspections. Spain bought check kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm said that incorrect results could be due to failures in collecting samples or using kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the wrong-checking kits and replace them with the second test kits overlooked by Shenzhen Biology. 80% of the check kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic gave the wrong results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be put into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the check kits purchased by Turkey from China had a “high error rate” and they “did not use them.”
Positive results were obtained from those who were tested positive after their quarantine and those who were exposed to positive SARS-CoV-2.
In the place of the first COVID-19 deaths in Italy, researchers working in Italy’s Tuscany settlements examined twice the entire population of approximately 3,400 people at intervals of about ten days.
Nearly half of those with positive outcomes had no symptoms, and all those with found cases were quarantined.
New infections with travel bans to the entrance-to-entry place have completely ended.
By aggressively exploring contacts, domestic travel restrictions, checks and quarantines, but without forcibly shutting down restaurants and retail establishments such as extreme restrictions, the 2020 coronavirus epidemic is considerably slower than other developed countries in Singapore.
Several programs have been cancelled, and Singapore has started advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened on March 23 after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also aggressively managed the epidemic by exploring contacts, domestic travel bans, checks and quarantines, but by less aggressive lock-down.
Statistical studies have shown that countries that have more checked death rates than expect cases have much lower death rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect only people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to investigate and whose national laboratories have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmation examination.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the “% of positive in checks” column is affected by the country’s checks policy.
Similar to other things, in a country where only hospitalized people are checked, there would be a higher percentage of positive checks than in a country where all citizens are checked, whether or not they show symptoms.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the function of cleaning your hands with the aim of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular handwashing with soap during the day on the "necessary shower" prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and haemorrhage, which are transmitted by the fecal pathway.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common gout, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important are: before and after the hobby, after cleaning the baby’s butt or changing the butt, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing meals or consuming raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned from ashes.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After your nose is sprayed, coughed or ripped.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean off pathogens (bacteria, toxins, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals with hands that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for ordinary people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And to reduce the death rate of newborns in cases of delivery at home.
A 2013 study found that well-washing hands exercises in children under the age of five may have a slight improvement in their increase in length.
In developing countries, simple structural changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce cases of diarrhea by almost a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in cases of diarrhea may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as self-motivated behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and intense respiratory infections (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 35 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or therapeutic measure, reducing the number of deaths from diarrhea by almost half and the number of deaths from intense respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning measures as part of water, cleaning and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against empathy that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can damage the skin due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a itchy, layered skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of psychiatric addiction disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission from the gastrointestinal pathway of the disease: after using the toilet (mature immersion, feces), after cleaning the baby’s buttocks (after changing the buttocks), before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or before/after eating raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other occasions when appropriate hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent disease transmission are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after scratching, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is lower.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of families adopted the practice of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; in the United States with 77 percent this rate was medium; and in China with 23 percent this rate was the lowest.Many methods of behavioral change are now available to enhance handwashing behavior with soap at critical times.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
This national program includes daily tooth cleaning from the original fluoride, as well as daily hand washing from soap, taking anti-coronavirus treatments twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Mixing soap or detergent in water may be better to remove microorganisms from the skin.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce barriers in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective skin detergent because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, do not easily dissolve in water.
However, a sufficient flow of water in cleaning is obtained.
Due to repeated use, solid soaps may contain bacteria left over from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that there is no likelihood of transfer due to the splashing of bacteria with splash.
Still, according to the CDC, “sapons with remedies from liquid soap dropping facility on the palms without touching hands are better.”
Health-conscious people have been vigorously promoted on antibacterial soaps.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant organisms are generated in nature from the use of recommended antiseptics or pesticides.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic-resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin-protecting agents, sophisticated classifications may include alm as pH regulators (acetic alm, escorbic alm, lactic alm), microbiotically active benzoic alm and other skin stimulants (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that simple soaps, trichlorone-containing antibacterial soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hands.
Comfortable hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
At body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) bacteria grow very quickly.
However, soap water is more effective than cold, hot soap water to remove soil and bacteria-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a water-free base hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, tax-taxed alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand robes, disinfectant hand robes or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which, for ease of use and to reduce the effect of drying alcohol, are formulated with glycerin in a liquid or foam, such as a carbomer in a gel (a polymer of acrylic algae), or a glycerin in a liquid or foam, such as an irritant.
The combination of Tanu hydrogen-perxide increases antimicrobial activity even more.Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are effective antibacterials.
Alcohol-ray sanitizers destroy bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain toxins (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, flu and hepatitis) and bacteria.
Alcohol-ray sanitizers, which are 70% alcoholic, destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of inserting (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and destroy 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria 1 minute after inserting (4 to 5 log reduction).
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the toxins of the Norovirus (or Norwalk) type that are the most common causes of infectious gastrointestinal shock.
The pores in the front and back of both hands and in the middle and all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, straw or gel is dried.
The pores of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed by scratching in both palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of hand sanitizer rubbs, especially when the hands appear to be dirty.
The increasing use of these indicators is based on ease of use and rapid destructive activity against microbes; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand wash unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are mixed into the formula.
Glycerin and/or other lubricants may be mixed into the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, the burning and drying of the skin from lubricant-containing alcohol-based hand sanitizers was significantly reduced compared to soap or antimicrobial repellents.
Contact allergies to the ingredients present in alcohol or alcohol hand robes are viral pharmatitis, contact euthyroid syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The lower tendency to induce contact dermatitis, which is more annoying than washing hands with soap and water, has become an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free indicators do not clean organic substances with their hands, but simply disinfect them.
That’s why hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of pathogens as soap and water, because the pathogens still remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is much dependent on materials and composition, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to possibly: reduce efficacy after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions, has been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application of formulations using benzalconyl chloride.
Many people in low-income communities can’t buy soap and can use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil alone may be more effective than water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is also a pesticide agent because it creates an alkaline fusion when exposed to water.
When soap is not available, the WHO has recommended ashes or sand as an alternative to soap.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended because stable water basins can become contaminated, although the temperature of the water does not matter.
Make the appropriate amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails, soaking on the hands.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Roast for at least 20 seconds.
Scratching produces scratching, which helps remove the bacteria from the skin, and longer scratching leads to more bacteria.
Wash well under water.
Washing in the basin can contaminate hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily re-polluted.The most discharged areas are the fingers, wrists, the area between the fingers and below the nails.
Artificial nails and clamped nail polish can provide shelter to microbes.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect hands from getting dry; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap is not available, various low-cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing if necessary, e.g. pouring water and/or using ashes from a hanging tap with suitable pores. In conditions of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water conservation solutions are available, such as "tip-taps"and other low-cost options.
Tipp-Tap is a simple technique in which a one-foot-powered lever, which is used to wrap the bow by the rope, and pour a small amount of water on the hands and soap ticks.
Effectively drying hands is an indispensable part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Large amounts of research suggest that paper towels provide more hygiene than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying from a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with jet-air dryers increased the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the fingers and 15% on the palms.
After handwashing and drying from paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the fingers and 77% on the palms.The scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability of other toilet users and the toilet environment to cross-sensitize.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow off microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially pollute the environment of other toilet users and toilets up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot air hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towel showed no significant spread of microbes.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the count of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying from paper towels.
Washing hands using hand wipes in the absence of soap and water during the trip is an option.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the discovery of its effectiveness in the prevention of disease in the hospital environment by the Hungarian physician Ignace Semelvis (1846), medical handwashing became indispensable.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Therapeutically, hands are washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which a splash is made using a suitable amount of soap and water or gel and each part of the hands is rubbed.
The fingers of both hands should be crushed.
If there is garbage under the nails, a tight hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since bacteria can stay in the water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exhaust doors should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again from those surfaces.
Handwashing in the health care system aims to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microorganisms”) and prevent them from transmitting.
According to a report from The New England Journal of Medicine, not washing hands in most medical settings has remained at unacceptable levels, with a large number of therapists and nurses forgetting to regularly wash their hands before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infection associated with the catheter by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing the standard hands-to-hand and hands-to-hand practices in healthcare fields.
The original hand hygiene guidance available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
Vittby was subjected to a relevant review by others.
If the performance of regulatory compliance is necessary, commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has identified “five opportunities” for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluids
Before the pesticide-destructive action, and
Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap ("antibacterial" or "antibacterial" soap) gives the handwashing agent the killing capacity.
Before surgery or in an arrangement where antibiotic-resistant organisms are extremely widespread, such killer capabilities may be desirable.To 'crack' your hands for surgery, to have a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching with hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a non-desinfectant towel to dry hands after washing, and another non-desinfectant tool for cleaning under the nails and brushes for cleaning rubber is necessary.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to grind for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, hands are dried with a non-desinfected cloth and a surgical sweater is worn.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of a sick person or to use a hand disinfectant.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by more than 35%, very few additional benefits were obtained.
Washing hands with simple soap makes the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious diseases more than triple than washing hands with antibacterial soap.When washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 minutes compared to rubbing hands with alcohol-based solution, it was found that rubbing hands with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But hand-based H1N1 influenza A viruses and clostridium diphysis bacteria are more effective than soap and water alcohol-based hand robes to reduce hand-based H1N1 influenza A viruses and clostridium diphysis bacteria. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care arrangements may include staff education on handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand robes, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered a cost-effective, essential means of achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal handwashing practices is a challenge due to the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools and workplaces.
For example, every private or public toilet in most rural Africa has very few hand washing tubs, even though there are cheap options to make hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to spilled habits rather than to lack of soap or water.
Encouraging and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing and bring changes to the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social promotion campaigns are less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the “three-star method” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that other hygiene requirements as well as students wash their hands from soap.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to three stars respectively.
Making a hand washing station can be part of the hand washing campaigns that are done to reduce disease and child mortality rates.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign aimed at trying to bring a change in behavior.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji of handwashing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to defending from DALYs.
However, one review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is considerably more cost-effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health – especially in people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignace Semelway who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, England who are “the founders of modern nursing.”
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by odor disorder called myasmus.
In the 1980s, food-generated outbreaks and health-related infections motivated the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as a critical way to prevent the spread of the infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 raised awareness about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect yourself from such infectious diseases in many countries.
For example, posters with “the right techniques of handwashing” were hung near the handwashing tubs in public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase “washing your hands from something” means declaring your reluctance to take responsibility for that thing or to believe in it.
It derives from the Matthew chapter of the Bible where Pontius Pilate separated himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began forcibly washing her hands in an attempt to clear a fictional stain, reflecting her criminal spirit about the crimes she committed and inducing her husband to commit crime.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others after remembering or reflecting on unethical tasks, and attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in complementary tasks of their other “cleansing” such as volunteering.
Religion recommends handwashing for both purposes of hygiene and symbolism. Symbolic handwashing with soap water without handwashing is a part of handwashing described in many religions including Bahá'í, Hindu, Jewish, Tewila and Nephilath communities, Lavabo in Christianity, and Uzú in Islam. Religion also recommends handwashing in particular to provide cleanliness after some works.
Hand washing after using the toilet in Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions is mandatory.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Shahidism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infections in the workplace
Occupational safety and health systems are applied to the control of the dangers of spreading COVID-19 infections on the workplace, to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to the control of dangers.
Adequate control of the risk of disease spread in the workplace depends on the workplace and tasks performed, which are based on the risk assessment of sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual employees who are at greater risk of having COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact tasks involve minimal business contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic measures of infection prevention are recommended, which include: washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory customs, and regular cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
Moderately exposed positions are those for which it is necessary to establish repeated or close contact with people who are not aware or suspected of having COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, a high-population working environment, and some high-scale sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, hazard control measures for this group include: contamination from high-efficiency air filters, using snowguards, andining personal protective equipment available for the situation if a COVID-19 infected person is faced.
OSHA considers health workers and dead-house personnel to be at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infected or suspected persons, and this risk increases and becomes a high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19 infected or suspected persons, or collect or handle samples from them.
Threats controls suitable for these employees include mechanical controls such as negative pressure convection chambers and personal safety equipment suitable for the job.
There can be many effects of COVID-19 outbreaks within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to being sick, the need to take care of others, or the fear of potential contact.
Which goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as reduced demand times or purchases through delivery or ongoing services), can change the shape of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of objects from the geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be affected. The preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective functions.
Plans address risk levels associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including risk sources, risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, and individual workers’ risk factors such as aged or outdated medical conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address the risks and random plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or national recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission between employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications,ining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the reactions adopted.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure widely used to create groups of hazard controls according to the effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, there are the most effective controls engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal security equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the worker’s behavior, and this can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or processes that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal Safety Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
Staff should be equipped to select all types of PPE depending on the danger, be applied in the appropriate type (such as the respiratory tract), be constantly and properly worn, be regularly inspected, beined and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or avoided contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact tasks have minimal business contact with people and other colleagues.
The recommended basic prevention measures for all workplaces include: regular and thorough handwashing, encouraging staff to stay at home if they get sick, providing breathing routines that cover cough and scratch, tissue and garbage exposure, preparing remote or cross-counters if necessary, discouraging staff from using other people’s tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals in the workplace is a crucial step for the protection of employees, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home as long as they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-reducing medications, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to the OSHA, moderately exposed tasks include those tasks that require repeated or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not aware or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission running around the business location, or because the individual has recently made international trips to places with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, a high-population working environment, and some high-volume sales arrangements. Installing high-efficiency air filters in engineering controls for these and higher-risk groups includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, setting up regular physical barriers such as transparent plastic snowguards, and setting up drive-throw windows for customer service. This and administrative controls for high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing common-minded meetings with virtual communications, setting up interlocutors, preventing unnecessary travels to locations where COVID-19 is running, developing emergency planning, including training and recording workers’ safety needs and other safety concerns on the hands, providing employees with a low-risk form or even CID-19 to alert individuals, providing them with a response to the security environment, including training and recording the worker’s worker’s worker’s needs.
Employees in this risk group require the use of respiratory tract virally.
If a person gets sick on an aircraft, appropriate controls for the safety of staff and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others up to 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or scratching.
When caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear useful medical gloves, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent coughing, or difficulty breathing, possibly wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other usable items should be disposed in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, postpone travel when sick under hazard controls and self-forming and immediately inform the passenger medical center on board if a person develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the isolated person’s chamber.For schools and baby care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term shut-off to clean or disinfect if an infected person is staying in a school building beyond community transmission.
When medium-to-minimum community transmission occurs, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling food in field rounds, meetings and other large meetings such as physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, switching arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as flu.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to strategies to create social distance.For law enforcement staff doing daily law activities, immediate health risks are considered as follows by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who have to contact persons confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during holding, before reusing their duty belts and equipment, staff should clean and disinfect using household cleaning spray or washing machine, and follow standard operating procedures for sealing and disposing of used PPE and sealing and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some health care and deceased-home workers to be in high or excessively high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport workers who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high-risk contact if practitioners perform aerosol-generating procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, collect or handle samples from them.
Aerosol-generating processes include pipeline propulsion, cavity-inducing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or sampling from the screw.
High-risk dead-home tasks include people who prepare the bodies of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they test bodies, they become very high-risk exposure. Additional mechanical controls for these risk groups include separation chambers for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including during the processes generating aerosols.
In some health care and dead-home arrangements, specific negative pressure coefficients may be appropriate.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be separated into separate waiting zones.In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory systems for individuals who work within 6 feet of patients known or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facial respiratory systems or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fit-tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory tract can provide more protection and improve the comfort of the worker.WHO does not recommend coverholes, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through physical fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the entrance site.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, a Googles face shield, chongas and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respiratory tract.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends using telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, only allowing those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for specific tasks, using the same respiratory system removed without taking care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for depressed individuals, through reducing the need for PPE.

There are extraordinary circumstances around us this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic has made it clear that all people in the world are connected to each other and that we have responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global solidarity, mutual cooperation, and community merit, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of deal we’ve seen among all of our colleagues on email, calls and chats is an extraordinary proof of how lucky we’ve been to work with extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues that I cannot describe in words.
Last week someone shared praise for our work with me.
She reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn toward Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to remain available online and to all of this critical resource.
Your work alone makes it possible, whether you keep the Sites on or source the salary of our colleagues or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it’s the most needed.
It is a moment when our work, and our way of doing it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of this mission, and the importance of your role in it, we are going to make some remarkable changes in the way we work with us this coming week.
Changes in our work and times.
As Robin said earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a timeline for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what was the appropriate response in our thinking to the situation before us, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to get rid of stress and want to cooperate in our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractors, and contract staff:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until the next notification.
We are not declaring holidays - if you are able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unexpected at this time, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring food, or go to the doctor, your skill is our priority.
We are not counting your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
I don’t need to say it, but we’re saying it.
No need for sick leave or PTO – just tell your manager and help your team adjust the calendar and timeline to make sure that the main area of work takes a no-no-no look.
(If you have confirmed that you have COVID-19, please tell Brian of T&amp;C Opps so that T&amp;C can assist you and ensure that the management takes appropriate care of your situation.)
The staff will receive full wages.
We have already said, and we are once again demonstrating our commitment to fulfilling our promise given to our contractors and clockwork staff.
Everyone will receive a salary based on their common working hours during normal circumstances.
If you are sick and can’t work, you’ll still get a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at such times.
Once again, taking care of yourself by yourself is most important.
We say that you talk to your manager so we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some acts are considered innocent.
There are some things that we can’t stop.
SREs, HR Opps, Trust & Security, and Grants Collecting Teams (e.g. others) perform very important tasks that may require additional cooperation.
To evaluate existing objectives and focus our attention on collaborating on things indispensable to our mission, we will initiate a process with all departments.
We all have a lot to do, we will all focus on just the most necessary projects.
If we slow down now, we will survive the injury later.
There is no plan for our “giving twice as much time for worship” after the global epidemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to fulfill the time-limits that have gone beyond reality.
We believe that circumstances have changed, and we will act towards setting new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What will happen with the APP?
Adapting to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we want to change the time-frame to complete our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that gives us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their super-important tasks, self-care, and caring for loved ones, and those who need or want to work on a shortened timeline over the next few weeks can be adjusted.
This extension of the time-frame will bring a significant reduction in our current planning workload and pressure on the entire organization.
We will put our proposal before the Board of Directors next week and we will inform the representatives and teams about further steps once we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership.
Office position, contact, and cleaning
Last week we discovered that one of our SF-based colleagues may have come into contact with the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning machines to disinfect all surfaces of the Sen Francisco Office.
She decontaminated every surface, lobby, and elevator bank that came to our floor with a hospital-grade antiviral solution.
Its own care-care protocol is being implemented using products that assist the safety of its inhabitants in the building.
We are confident that when we return, the office will be fully ready.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office adopted a completely remote arrangement in line with the shared guidance from Sen Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, taking a place in Brooklyn is also being discussed.
These discussions continue, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working away from home for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working from home/distance for a long time know that this needs adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to older people of more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Clearly define meetings, keep the agenda ready, and send the course content already.
Create your default video with the help of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and combination.
Initiate to facilitate each meeting, monitor a person’s chat for questions and take account of the speaker list, and help a person take notes (or take notes from collaboration)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Use your health compensation for alpha.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed tasks.
The HR Operations team is investigating webinar-based employment guidance to cooperate in the growth in distributed work across the entire foundation.
Last week we asked all community-funded clients to cancel public programs funded by Wikimedia, such as Aditathon, until the WHO announces the end of the global epidemic.
We told them that we understood that our requests for subsidization and other restrictions may make it impossible to fulfill their mutual granting activities, and that no one will be punished for being forced to delay or amend those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimania and other regional and topical community conferences.
This barrier makes the whole global community feel painful, but also feels relieved by the clarity and merit of focusing on their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a place for the community to monitor the impact and track our communications with them.
Maintain contact about COVID-19 related issues
We will send you an invitation next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT in your calendars for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend a little time connecting with each other.
We are together in these circumstances and there to help as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this email on Office wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in notably affected countries at this time.
If you have anything to ask about travel, programs, a major agenda, or coverage-related challenge, or you need help with anything else, please notify the CRT and work with it.
We are there to provide assistance as needed and help establish relationships.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please email Brian Juden, director of HR International Global Operations.
Any of these changes should not be seen as a waiver of our duties.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our tasks and responsibilities are likely to need to be so optimized as we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the cooperation of their needs, and provide the service the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Right now, it’s time to help each other, and make room for important tasks coming in the coming weeks and potentially in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jame V, Joel L, Linet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jame V, Jenny U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Tobin N).
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activity of the related angiotensin-transforming enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is sometimes referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing methanzyme located on the surface of the intracellular and other cells.
The ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrine oractical amino amyl conductor domain.
ACE2 is a type I membrane protein that once crosses with an enzymatically active domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The exogenous domain of ACE2 is disintegrated from the parselial domain by another enzyme called Shadez, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly connected to the cell membrane of type II pneumococcal cells, the enterosite of the small intestine, the intervertebral cells of the artery and scrotum, and the soft muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA exposure is also found in prostatic vulcate, striatum, hypothalamus and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a response to ACE.
ACE breaks down the angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 then breaks down the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and water-decomposes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9]- can also break down many other peptides including bradykinin, epeline, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane transport of the intracranial amino amino conductor SLC6A19 and its role in heart disease has been explained.
As a paralytic protein, ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-generating virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 generating virus) serve as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
More specifically, connecting to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface of the conjunctive S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 leads to the transfer of both viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cells and endocytosis.
This entry process also requires the stimulation of S protein by the nutrient serine protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential medicine.This is why some people have speculated that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells could help fight infection.
However, several professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A methodological review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a remarkable 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia.”
At the same time, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in those with trauma and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although the results were less prevalent than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The reconstituent human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new therapy for acute damage to the lungs, and has appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pig infants with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory crisis syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the beginning of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour process (period) of effect.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-enzyme inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulatory angiotensin II is increased.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications that are designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (“contacters”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several applications have been developed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the construction of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, with regards to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
In the less intrusive option, it involves using Bluetooth signals to log proximity to another user’s cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems to support such Bluetooth-based apps.
In China, the Chinese government has hired an app in combination with Alipay, allowing citizens to check whether they are in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, this app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and will be available for planning within weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a geo-fensing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential reduction in effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple limited to “official” or otherwise reputable organizations to determine which types of organizations could include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed their concerns about the implications of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus apps, about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus epidemic will be destroyed after this threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for boundaries on such surveillance.
Organizations have declared eight conditions on government projects:
Surveillance must be “legal, necessary and proportional”;
There should be a comprehensive section for the details of surveillance and surveillance;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be safeguarded and demonstrated protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid promoting discrimination and disqualification;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined by law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens against abuse and to respond to abuse;
“Significant involvement” will be required by all “relevant stakeholders” including public health experts and unauthorized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Widowut Borders (Reporter Owen Grenzen) (RSF) have also released the checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unexpected location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server require the acquisition of personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use the central server for inter-communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to track contacts in South Korea.
Rather than using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to generate notifications to potentially infected individuals via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to dramatic changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites.Many countries including Germany have considered using centralized and privacy-protected systems.
Until April 6, 2020, these details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preservation contact tracing with a large body of research literature since at least 2013 is an upgraded concept.By 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user’s proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination process involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preservation proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, former contact event number, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection technologies when collecting and using location or path-protection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gong Rog: Maintenance of Personal Provision in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, originally established in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups organized in the context of essentially similar approaches and largely similar protocols, aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interactivity of tracking and warning apps, which was a key aspect of achieving widespread optimization.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has open-sourceed the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and the companies controlling the mobile platforms Apple, Android and iOS announced an initiative for contact transactions, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is expected to be available in three stages:
Official privacy-protection Coronavirus tracking apps to enable governments to create tools
Unique of this functionality directly in iOS and Android
Drug re-use (also known as drug re-use, re-profiling, re-revision or therapeutic change), for which it was originally developed, is the re-use of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and health-related plasma surveys.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides an appropriate project to develop effective antiviral drugs for protection from COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papan-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helixes, S-protein and ADP ribofosphate.
Husan and others studied several candidate compounds, who then optimized and analyzed their clusters for similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2-anti-drug in a pre-diagnostic study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chlorokin is an anti-malaria drug that is also used to protect against some self-defense diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chlorokin and related hydroxychlorokin, will be among the four drugs to be studied as part of a solidary clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the trials of New York State Chlorockin and Hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorocquile phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial procedure and it is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are admitted to the hospital but are unable to receive treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langon Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxyclorokin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen received a negative test for an average of four days, while the duration of the disease was eleven days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with Nymonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received Fevipiravir and half Omephenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is very small and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase drugs from Japan for its stockpiles, and use the military to deliver drugs to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shenzhou Abe has sent proposals to the Trump administration about buying the drug.This drug may be less effective in severe cases of disease, where the virus has already been classified.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of a combination of antiviral lopinavir and retonavir, lopinavir/retonavir (Calatra), concluded that “no benefits were seen.”
Drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that would bind to the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources for the reuse of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidity test.
Rembrandt was manufactured and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Rembrandt had artificial environmental antiviral activity to protect against many philo-, neumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest that Remedevir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.Many clinical trials are underway, including two trials run by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with more serious illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intramuscular vitamin C for hospitalization and seriously ill people with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (in China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), for the treatment of patients with a condition that precedes the appearance of symptoms infected with Novell coronavirus, is planning a clinical trial for an end to asthma:a developed corticosteroid, Tigins Elvesco (cyclosodine).

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
A number of Scandinavian protests are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular load is being widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian Drug Agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multi-centric study of 300 patients who researched the use of enoxaparine sodium on pesticide and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs, which have been developed for outbreaks of previous ones such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th Edition Guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the guidelines of the Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as possible reusable as COVID-19 treatments:
Toxicumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also tested in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for protection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are still being made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a vaccine for protection from SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first-stage safety studies in April.
Covid-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, resulting in considerable investment and research activities to develop the vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection from SARS-CoV-2.
As in April, the CEPI initiative’s priorities for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global acquisition.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the launch of 2020 to create effective vaccines for protection from COVID-19.
Phase I security studies include advanced major platform objectives:
Nuclear cell (DNA and RNA) (Step I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Step I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to the Milken Institute 79), and 37 others have been announced, but fewer public information is available (which are being designed or projected).
In a Phase I-II trial, preliminary safety and immunity tests are carried out, it is usually done at random, placebo-controlled and multiple locations while prescribing more accurate, effective dosages.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, with a control group monitoring adverse effects on optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of vaccines for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in “pre-diagnostic” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the ability of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify viral proteins to induce immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccination Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Sussex announced the start of work on a vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around January 29, 2020, Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, headed by Henke Schutemaker, announced that it has begun working on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with his biotech partner Vaksart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership to develop vaccines with Vaccart.
On February 8, 2020, Laboratory Oncogen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for the neo-anti-cancer vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he has finalised the synthesis of vaccines and is starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Genrex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a Li-Ki peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materials Command in Fort Detroit and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, West Maryland, both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that it is in the development and manufacture of vaccines
Novartis will work closely with INC.
The partners announced plans for pre-diagnostic trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that it is working with 11 vaccines, and that it will take at least half to two years to develop a vaccine even on a short-term basis.
On March 12, 2020, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which plans to conduct human testing for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Kurwaek “a large sum for the special acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines,” against which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Fisher announced a partnership with the German company Biotech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, is currently in pre-diagnostic trials, whose clinical trials are expected to start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotech company, Taxibiotec, announced that they will have pre-diagnostic test results in April 2020 and that tests on their final vaccine candidate may start until fifty.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Pre-Epidemic Innovations (CEPI) announced that it will invest $4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, which includes the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development $29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curvac, Inovio, Novavix, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-provoking RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine was developed within 14 days after the candidate received a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicaid and the University of Sussex.
Nearly at the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million with plans to establish a national “tech bank” of several new vaccines that could be used in other coronavirus outbreaks, specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine a test of a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVacc in mice, stating that “MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunits have triggered antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice], which became apparent to begin 2 weeks after vaccination.”
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasica spray.
Using bacteriophage, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, raised resources for acquisition from IBM to supercomputers.
Some vaccines have toxic effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have additional benefits from the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Initial research assessing the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate the need for biosafety level 3 preventive measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful hole for developing vaccines and treatments for protection from a MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents quoted by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronavirus such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, deterioration of odor sensation and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be two to fourteen days.
Although the symptoms are mild in most cases, viral pneumonia and multiple failure develop in some cases.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus spreads mainly between people during close contact, including: through small drops caused by coughing, scratching or talking.
Although these drops are generated when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or surfaces instead of being infectious over long distances.
People can even become infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission to the later stages of the disease may be possible before and after the symptoms appear.The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a fetus to an infertility.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can become sclerotic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up and being blue in the face or lips; seek immediate medical attention when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, rhinitis or sore throat can be seen.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been seen in different percentages.
In some cases in China, only the strain of the chest and sharp beating were seen at first.
In some cases, the disease can rise to pneumonia, multiple failure and death.
It is called the time period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Information shows that symptoms do not develop in all reduced individuals.
The role of these excretory carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, initial evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The percentage of infected people not showing symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20 percent of all confirmed cases remained alarming during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include alarming cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infections were alarming at the time of testing that day.
Both blush and larvae can have large amounts of viruses.
Speaking in a loud voice produces more drops than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that drops that go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) from uncovered cough can be produced.
Although this virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors involved in corridors outside people’s rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as pipeline propensity and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause aerosols from the respiratory secretion to form and thus have an airborne transmission.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the stool, this risk is considered to be lower.This virus is most contagious when people are targeted; although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person normally infects two to three other individuals.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cloves, for three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and for four hours on 99% copper.
Still, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products disrupt the fatty protective layer of viruses, deactivate them, as well as free them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benthalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antibacterial agent), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest amount of virus, and the sixth patient showed the highest amount of virus on the second day of the trial.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first separated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the Novell SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the viral enzymes reach the nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in the most abundant amounts in type II pneumonic cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a “counter” (poplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of hospitalized people in Wuhan, China, and this is more common in serious illnesses.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms due to peritoneal donor response and disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease are high, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with ACE2 clients in the heart.
ACE2 greases are excessively manifested in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been found in patients with ICUs with COVID-19 infections, which may be associated with poor disease diagnosis. Examinations of the bodies of people who die from COVID-19 have found diffuse aerobic damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-associated external agents within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a rebound to the ACE2-expressing subcellular cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of peritoneal hyperplasia.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-serum T-cells were shown to be associated with the selection of donor IL-6-serum monocytes and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
External lymphocytic substances have also been in the body examination.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharynx; however, a nasopharynx or a mucus sample can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken at a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is reduced.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a subtype of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
By April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect the active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that the purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first-care-to-place testing for use at the end of that month on March 21, 2020.The clinical guidelines issued by Zhangnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan outlined ways to detect infection based on clinical features and epidemic risk.
Bilateral multipolar ground-glass ambiguities with a peripheral, uncompromising and post-distribution in early transitions are common.
Subplural dominance, crazy paying (thickening of walls paved with variable aerosol filling) can appear when the disease grows, and thickening.
Fewer data are available about COVID-19’s ultra-sensitive wounds and disease body action.
The main clinical findings obtained from the body exam are:
Macroscopy: Shoath in Phosphus Cover, Pericarditis, Pneumonia and Pneumonia
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be seen:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary shof, neoplastic overgrowth, large non-saturated neoplasms, intramuscular inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multiscentric giant cell construction
Severe pneumonia: Severe pneumonic damage (DAD) with fluid aerobic leakage.
DAD causes acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS) and severe low-oxygenicity.
Treatment of pneumonia: management of leaks and pulmonary intracranial metabolism in the aerobic cavities
Blood: Transmitted Intervertebral Screening (DIC); Leukoarytroblastic Indication
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water repeatedly and for at least 20 seconds,ining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or scratching and recommends using the inside part of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygiene of the hands after coughing or squeezing is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of face covering from clothes in public institutions to limit transmission by partially exposing individuals.The strategies aimed at creating social distance are to reduce the contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public functions.
Distance making guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines are not expected until at least 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the extreme of the epidemic, which is called “reducing the epidemic.”
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating, and after sprinkling, coughing, or scratching their nose.
In addition, it recommends the use of at least 60% alcohol-based hand protectors, but only when soap and water are not readily available.Areas where professional hand protectors are not readily available, the WHO provides two indications for local production.
In these classifications, the antimicrobial action is derived from ethanol or isopropylene.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial molecules in alcohol; it is “not an active substance for hand resistance.”
Glycerol is mixed as an irritant.
People are managed with auxiliary care, which may involve providing fluid therapy, oxygen assistance, and other affected vital organs with assistance.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporal Eczema Oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still questionable.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supporting treatment may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intactivists and palmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical practitioners recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when aerosol-generating procedures such as pipeline propensity or gestation are carried out.
For health workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection separation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.
Recommended equipment is: PPE chongas, respiratory or facial masks, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves.When available, respiratory (rather than facial masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory systems are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized the mask for use under the Emergency Experiment Authority (EUA).
They are designed to protect against aerated particles such as dust, but the effectiveness towards a specific biological indicator is not predictable for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, home-made masks when the mask is not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so serious that they require mechanical convection or other alternatives, but in a few percentages of cases it is necessary.
Type of respiratory assistance for persons with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for those admitted to hospital, with some evidence that high-flow nasal reception or bipolar positive atmospheric pressure can be avoided from tuberculosis.
Whether either of these two provides a similar benefit to a seriously ill person is not known.
Some therapists prefer to use injection mechanical convection when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal injection.Serious cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits a health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of severe enough COVID-19 cases that make hospitalization necessary.
A study in China found that 5% were enrolled in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for recovery, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have eventually been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical convection becomes more complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS) and it becomes difficult to provide oxygen to the north.
To maximize oxygen distribution while reducing the risk of lung damage and neumothorax associated with the fan requires pressure control systems and high PEEP-capable fans.
High PEEP may not be available on old fans.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Ramsay is the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
People with severe illness can be tried to give antiviral medication.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has temporarily allowed health-beneficial plasma as experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
No clinical studies have been conducted on this to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting the 'negative contacts' using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also warns local health authorities.Big data analyses for cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track cell phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and protect people who came into contact with infected civilians.
Additionally, in March 2020, Doei Telecom shared joint phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Coach Institute, for preventing the spread of the virus and research.
Russia has employed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Galera said he has been informed by mobile phone operators that “40% of people are in some way bullying.”
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for a global call for creative solutions to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience crises from fear of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or self-infection.
BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “A growing social segregation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and an economic downturn are an ideal storm that damages people’s mental health and ability.”
This disease can have a mild course with or without some of the symptoms that coincide with normal strabismus such as other common upper respiratory tract diseases.
Light cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or excessively severe diseases can take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious infection with COVID-19, but there is a decrease in data for COVID-19.
In the most seriously affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, capillary trauma, or multiple failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include prostatitis, abnormal coughing and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scudden abnormalities, an increase in prothrombin time, have been in 6% of those admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function has been observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to ICU had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time from showing initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
Tissue deformity examinations of body-examined pulmonary samples reflect widespread aerobic damage with cellular fibromyxide leaks in both lungs.
Cell pathological changes occurring from viruses were observed in neoplasms.
The picture of the lungs appeared similar to the acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by higher levels of troponins or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of people admitted to the hospital had pre-examined conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation of a region can also affect the death rate.
Estimates of death rates by situation also vary due to those regional differences and due to system-related difficulties.
Due to the lower calculation of mild cases, the death rate can be estimated to be higher.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases occurring in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans expressed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care after recovery.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for the coronavirus on the date after recovery from COVID-19 have been.
These cases are thought to be worse for an untreated infection than for re-infection.
The virus is considered to be of fertile origin, spreading naturally and through infection from pest to human.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the infection was spread almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020, the first date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to determine the death rate.
These numbers continue to vary depending on the region and time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time passed from the early outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO established the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, by 17 April 2020, the global death-mala ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected individuals who die from a disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These figures are not timed and follow a specific population from infection until the case is recovered.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of immunity can get information about how many people are infected.
At the heart of the outbreak in Italy, in a small village of 4600 people, Castiglione d'Ada, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelts, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and to young people, resulting in relatively low mortality rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
Moreover, the German health system is not extremist.
In the Netherlands, according to estimates from blood donors, approximately 3% can be immune.
COVID-19 has confirmed 69 (0.004% of the population) deaths.
The impact of the epidemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have shown higher mortality rates among men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only shorter at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-intersection are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of co-infectious conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government is not monitoring gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to their viruses.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Gabriel said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified, i.e. December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), insect species or group of people, which are consistent with international recommendations for naming with the aim of preventing humiliation.The virus that generates COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 viruses" and "viruses responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are generally referred to as “coronaviruses.”
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus”.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as intermediate names for viruses and diseases of acute respiratory disease, which comply with the 2015 Guidelines on not using spots in disease and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limits in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as nasica feathers and fans.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an immediate ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver within the required time-frame, a local start-up printed the required 100 valves overnight by reverse engineering.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other sides of the disease emerged and spread online rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other organisms.
Studies to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, goats, and chickens failed.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “solidarity trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hope of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available at this time, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The previous function on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 grains to enter human cells.
Three screening strategies are being tested.
First, the researchers’ goal is to build a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether passive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the Molecular Vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-contact protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme grain.
A third strategy is the nucleic amyl vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique of making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been to be a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials will be carried out by April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychlorokin or chlorokin.
Destined to be announced by the end of April, with nine Phase III trials on Remedevir in many countries, most Chinese research is working on reusable antiviral drugs.
Until April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was ongoing. A number of existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Remadezivir, Chlorockin and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lonavir/Ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
By March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the effectiveness of Remedsivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with unauthorized use of Remedevir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. Chlorokin, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, the research has been called for counterparty review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology noted, recommending a daily dose of one gram, that twice as many doses are exceedingly dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for the use of hydroxychlorokin and chlorokin at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.China's 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir for use to protect against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed for the constriction of artificial environmental SARS-CoV-2.
Nitroxannanide is recommended for further study in organisms after detection of low concentration synthesis of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preliminary concentration protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 by intervention, ending with ACE2 graphene.
With or without azithromycin, there are major limits of studies of chlorocrine and hydroxycloroquine, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit artificial environmental SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing cytokine levels in the post-severe phases of COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the increase in the amount of cytokine.Tokilisumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study has been completed.
It has passed a Phase 2 non-randomized trial at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
In combination with serum ferritin blood tests to identify an increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to address such elderly people, who are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interluxin-6 Grahame Inhibitor was approved by the FDA in 2017, for a different reason, based on pre-empirical case studies for the treatment of CAR T cell therapy-induced steroid uplifting cytokine release syndrome.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Toxiclav is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated immunities produced by the immune system of people who recover from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-tech method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with undeniable consequences.
Viral desynthesis is the anticipated activity by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other activities, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal immunities, are in development.
The production of health-beneficial serums, which contain a liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and have specific immunities for this virus, can be increased for accelerated planning.
