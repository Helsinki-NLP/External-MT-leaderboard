Welsh people are worried they will be seen as innocent
Some MPs are concerned about a suggestion to change their English titles to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Parliament in Welsh).
This follows plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
ACUs across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be a hot topic.
The Labour MP said his group was concerned because the title was "crossed with the words Twp and Pwp".
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: You don't want to be called that.
The Welsh Party's AC said the group as a whole was "displeased" with the suggestion and had offered other options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was keeping an open mind about the name change, but suggested there was not much difference on the surface between MWP and Muppet.
The ASC Welsh translation does not cause as much trouble.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, it will be up to the members themselves to make the final decision on any descriptions to the titles of Assembly Members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals. e call for the assembly was widely supported in the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but MWP came out stronger in the public consultation.
The ACs are reportedly suggesting other options, but the work of reaching a consensus could lead to the resignation of the Prime Minister, Elin Jones, who is expected to table draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the scheme works, including rules on the non-application of the CAs and the design of the committee system.
The EPs will have the final vote on what they should call when they debate the legislation.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country should change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, a neighboring country that has its own independent state called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on the name change and has said he will disrupt the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's rumors are rife as churches in Harlem face hardship
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I've spoken to", said Mr. Adams.
Today, none of them.
He said it was understandable why the bars had disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today", he said.
Bars are no longer considered community living rooms where people go regularly.
As for churches, they are worried that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it to, and that before long they will be back in the same old position.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominiums filled with the kind of people who wouldn't help the rest of the shrines in the area.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "which means that all these churches will close sooner because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - The Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
The building became the property of a black congregation that had been worshiping nearby.
St. Martin's was transferred to a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or elevate black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as the Johnson Father's estate made plans for reconstruction, the bells were commissioned.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and rector of St Martin's Church, was proud to name them the Poor People's Clothes.
The expert who sang the bells in July gave them another name: Cultural Treasure and Unique historical instrument.
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, noticed that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to sing the larger bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church was no man's place.
What has happened at St Martin's in recent months has been a complex history of bankers and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the church's underground leaders, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vicarage - the governing body of the parish which includes lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to state concerns that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the vicarage, although the vicarage had not been associated with the hiring of the architects and contractors the diocese had sent there.
Some planners complained about the lack of transparency in the bishopric.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy as he burns himself in search of a crab in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while diving for sharks in California, according to officials, on the first day of the shark season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for about a half hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, then he approached him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was excited at first, but when he reached the boy, Hammel told him to pretend he was screaming, "I've been beaten!"
I've been treated!
His shoulder was torn open.
I called everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was pulled from the water in a helicopter and transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in critical condition.
We don't know which shark species was responsible for the attack.
In a briefing to the media, the lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim suffered damaging injuries to the upper part of his body.
The beach access from Ponto Beach at Casablad to Swami Beach at Ecinitas was blocked by officers for 48 hours for security and investigation purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty boutiques in the form of department stores with specialist assistants.
As part of an effort to reach the UK beauty market, a £2.8bn market that is still growing despite declining fashion and home goods sales, the larger beauty brands will be trialled in 11 stores across the country.
This investment comes in the beauty world as supermarkets look for ways to use empty shelves after being chased for TV sets, microdons and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty goods offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique hair collection so that most products are suitable for vegans - something that is increasingly being called for among young shoppers.
In addition, perfumer The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon in south London last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people are shopping online and moving towards buying a little food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and goods other than food.
Sainsbury's has been providing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous effort to repackage its beauty and luxury items failed.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended following a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the pharmacy's stores into the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, which included 281 stores and was sold for £125m.
Lloyds would be part of the plan, he said, as it would add an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have completely changed the tone and feel of our beauty festivals to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be there to offer advice.
Our understanding of brands designed to satisfy every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a vital beauty destination challenging the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is a conspirator has Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of the Dragons of Den, was reluctant to pull out of a £11million deal with TV presenter Holly Willoughby to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of home accessories and goods.
The pair's business was compared to the Paltrow Wine Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of the hosts of This Morning, had posted a message on Instagram announcing he was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Den Dragons, is rumoured to have Holly Willoughby pull out of her profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "depressed" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted in a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she didn't have enough time left for Truly, their brand of home accessories and goods.
The business had been compared to the Paltrow Wine Goop brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones travelled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her long-term future and the work she would do over the next few decades.
Everyone is surprised to hear that she has decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters at Marlow, and those are ready to be sold.
Experts believe that this decision by one of Britain's biggest banking stars could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products, including clusters, ingredients, clothing and household goods.
This may be the end of a long friendship too.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We don't comment on his business affairs".
It was a tough course and then we fell in love
He joked about the end of the media criticism he would receive for making what some say was a "non-presidential" comment and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
Trump said by a news anchor.
I didn't give up anything.
He said Kim was keen to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting Trump described as a major step forward towards denuclearizing North Korea.
However, the debate on denuclearisation has slowed.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not believe the U.S. is responding in accordance with North Korea's early denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more fervent in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free the West and ensuring the remaining American troops return home.
He went on to justify his unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front.
Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island in Indonesia, by the Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster was declared, something that is necessary to mobilize international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging", Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palermo, they are not yet sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is far from being prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other islands.
It appears that no tsunami warning was issued in Palu, although a warning was issued, which contributed to the death toll.
It is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia at best.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was hanging in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racially integrated infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a thorn in Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko also faces pressure from long-running nominal tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bayonets and arrows, as well as other deadly weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of the Liverpool team, scoring a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge stopped Liverpool from losing a Premier League game to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri and he scored about 30 Chelsea goals as the team lost 1-0.
He kicked the ball to his left before shooting towards the far post.
The ball lifted high above the box as it moved towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and threw the ball into the net.
"I was trying to get to that position and get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing when that's possible, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I caught the ball without thinking too much about it, just going for it.
A century ago, Chelsea were winning 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the Belgian star, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea goalkeeper passed the ball with a sack back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the centre of the field and sprinting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic gave a fast pass and went fast in the middle of the field.
Then, the ball quickly passed between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard was the first defender to end up in the back of the net with his left foot passing Alisson Becker, one of Liverpool's players.
Liverpool play Napoli in a group game in the Premier League at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA European Championship at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Total deaths following the Indonesian tsunami rise to 832
The total death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped amidst the rubble of buildings that collapsed when the 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, an earthquake that caused landslides as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered with the rubble of demolished buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Manbedw, Galanni Dwiddy, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death at Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report if they heard or saw anything.
Detective Inspector Brian OHagan said: "Although the investigation is only just beginning, I would ask anyone who has been in the John Street area of Manchester to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on dash cams, they should contact us in case they have information that is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found came from Penedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews recently tried to return to his apartment but police have told him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard it happened.
Residents are now being told that they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed back in.
One police officer was heard telling the man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
The lady of the site arrived in her tears.
She kept repeating "This is so awful".
At 2pm there were two police stations in the curtain and another station outside it.
Several officers were standing in the curtain monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with the record 247 30 September.
The Cromwell statue outside the Senedd is the latest memorial to be part of the history's re-whammy.
Removing the statue would be poetic justice for the horrific destruction it caused to so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction wrought by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one of "true" attempts to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current debate over the removal of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromell outside St Stephen's Palace would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for carrying out or ordering the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century judgement and is part of the history of a figure that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, more in the 19th century than perhaps today, regard Cromwell as a figure who protected parliament from external pressures, namely the monarchy in his case.
We don't know if that's entirely true or not and that's an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our country since then and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of the debate.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance.
The Mouse Reibus in the Killing of a Farmer of China
A pig raped and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man, who was identified by his nickname Yuan, was found dead by a pig's tail in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his family from the neighbouring province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 goats at the market.
The next morning. his body was found dead and he noticed that the door of a nearby pig pen was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the fur and there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My foot was broken and all was blood", said the foot, who was nicknamed Wu, according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera video showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his chicken.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan Na'i was not the beast that killed the man.
One of the market's managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the site.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig held a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that blood taste can cause them to behave that way.
They're being smart.
They're young, they're very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You have to give them enough respect", he said.
The storm Rosa is causing heavy rain over a large area of the southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters off the west coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, as of 5am Eastern time Sunday. The storm was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a backwater is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the hurricane will begin to push a deep tropical depression northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will be carrying up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical storm will then react with the approaching thunderstorm causing heavy rainfall over the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of hand will cause dangerous large flooding, debris flooding and possible desert earthquakes.
Deep tropical rainfall will cause rainfall rates of between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be as much as 2 to 4 inches in parts of the southeast, particularly over much of Arizona.
Large flooding is possible with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be very uncomfortable to venture out into the wilderness on foot with the threat of a tropical hand.
Heavy rainfall could cause the mountains to become wild rivers and a thunderstorm and thunderstorm could cause strong winds and mudslides in the area.
The approaching sound wave will cause some local heavy hand in parts of the Southern California coast.
A total of more than half an inch of hand may fall, which could cause a small stream of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the area's first flood during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical cyclones will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rainfall spreads further late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
Temperatures will change dramatically across the US during October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is nearly a 20-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm into October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s, give evidence on six different networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters disrupting normal schedules for Friday's unexpected broadcast: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake states that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her inappropriately and tried to take her clothes off at a party at the high school, and he had been drunk.
Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he was absolutely certain that did not happen.
It was likely seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company averaged the number of audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people watching in offices.
To give perspective, this audience size was similar to an audience that would watch a football game or the Wobrawr Academi.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's guests have given strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, who led all networks with a 5.69 million-plus audience during the hearing, which lasted throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was much interest following the hearing as well.
Flake was the most prominent figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office declared that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning with protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood looking around the floor for a few minutes as he got a headache, live on television on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
It is said unto her, Thou hast power, and many daughters are weak.
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filming live hours later, when it came time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and have it voted on in the full Senedd.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominees by next week, an outcome that minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was partially convinced after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a discussion with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses judges of playing politics in Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May denounced those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union as "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her front-page interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticized what she called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a "ridiculous" proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs together.
Police arrested Dyton Simpson on suspicion of killing one of the LSU players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will be going to prison on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers have released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the encounter.
Police made a speculative discovery at the site and say they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted to shooting Wayde and killing him.
He has a $350,000 fund, the Attorney General said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head into the chest.
The department commends the refugee task force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked the area's law enforcement team for their dedication and work to ensure justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "heartbroken" and "shocked" to hear of Wayde's death.
This is the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
Arsonist tasked with looting Mexico City
A massive volcanic eruption from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Control warned Mexicans on Saturday not to go near the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and mud emissions were recorded over 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of collections and surveys.
Images on social media showed thin layers of mud covering the front windows of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The arsonist is called Don Goyo and has been alive since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters ahead of the one-year anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined competitive protests to mark a year since Catalonia's split vote on secession.
A group of pro-secession protesters beat back the riot police with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dirt in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Clashes also occurred later in the day, with police using their batons to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Never forget, never forgive" and one-sided protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in this area currently on the brink of independence, a year after the 1 October referendum that Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but few people turned out to vote and those who were against secession had boycotted the vote significantly.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a counter-demonstration in favor of the national police.
Opposition came before him but he was forced to follow a different course.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to the separatist protest with his wife, he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
LATEST year, we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry for joy at being able to vote but we are back in the same old situation now", he said.
Despite achieving a small but vital victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence groups have struggled to keep the momentum going this year and many of their most prominent leaders have either exiled themselves or are waiting for a trial to help organise the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, politicians on both sides had been stirring the waters during the clash.
The resentment is growing, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the excesses we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car was driven into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and the building itself.
It's possible that a crossbow was shot at the car somewhere too.
Menga's rocket secured a 1-0 win for Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured a victory for Livingston
Livingston stunned Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to miss the second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in seconds.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, who are top and eight points ahead.
Before that, the Rangers will host a game against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has played six straight games in the lower divisions, and head coach Holt hasn't missed a game since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against visitors
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but he pushed his effort across the goal surface, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort wide after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's head across the goal,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for others in certain areas.
And that's how the all-important goal was scored.
The Rangers kicked a free kick and worked Livingston to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the center of the box.
By then, the Rangers were in control of the ball but they were unable to break through the home defenders and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not much worried.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who kicked the ball wide from another set of play by Livingston.
Crossing fans were constantly coming to Livingston's fox and they continued to be cleared, and two penalty kicks - after Halkett challenged the substitute player, Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - were dismissed.
A stunning performance by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland analysts at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise expectations on this downward path.
Their style of play and staff have not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be commended for the way he has motivated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, setting up a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have much inspiration.
Although they played well at times under Gerrard, their standards were not seen.
They had a big fight on their last ball - they only opened the home side once - and it was quite a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Mixed welcome to Erdogan in Cologne
It was a warm and cheerful day on Saturday as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, a visit to try to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough fans had come to the mosque's perimeter to see their parade.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Jewish - made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them to the country.
These protest ceremonies reflect the friction associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and an autocrat by others.
Car accident in Deptford: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes a few months after another driver died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Road closure arrangements and directions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers have been injured in a storm
Six officers have been injured in a shooting at a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The storm occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case is ongoing.
Special Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the storm, which involves eight prisoners and occurs in just one area.
The officers' minor facial injuries were treated on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specialised trained prison staff have gone there to deal with this ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend more time in prison.
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison's governor was reportedly treated in hospital after being assaulted by one of the prisoners.
And last October, anti-riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious incident where staff were attacked with a pole pole.
Hurricane Rosa is in the Midst of Major Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dry Areas Can Benefit)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa travel across the Southwest Desert, posing a threat of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will be keeping an eye out for major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning around late Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of AZ's borders.
The latest models of the National Center on Aging predict between 2 and 4 inches of hand, with a few rare examples totaling up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Peninsula.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert including the Great Basin and the central Rockies are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with a few cases totaling up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, Rosa rain can be beneficial as they live in a dry area.
While flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial because of the current dry conditions in the Southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the highest category but one, weather.com said.
Initially, Rosa's route will lead to land along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, which was still as strong as a Sunday morning current with winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward traveling 12 mph.
The storm is reaching the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean so it is weakening.
Because of this, the hurricane is expected to make landfall in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California into northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, then traveling up through Arizona and south into Utah arriving late on March night.
"The main threat from Rosa or the remnants of the hurricane is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. Desert", the National Center for Tropical Storms said.
This rain is expected to create major flooding that can endanger life as well as a flood of rubble in the desert and earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital and remains there in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have asked anyone with material on their cell phones of what happened to bring that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the hatred and anger of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the shameful and disgraceful tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the hatred and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was under fire when he denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had sexually abused him decades ago, when they were both in their teens.
Ford testified at the hearing about his claim as well.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's brilliance and standard and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal professionals of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told the crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking about the importance of the Republican convention in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not trying, but I'm really trying", he said.
That's why I'm going everywhere trying to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is "resist and block".
The first key formal vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday morning, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds are killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them asleep as massive waves slashed the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres hit the beach late at night, sweeping many away and killing and destroying anything along the way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they didn't run away and they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it was washing cars, boncyfi, houses, it was hitting everything on the ground, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 cya (497 mya) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops damaged, bridges collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Re-plans were still shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that included 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and remote bay, could have absorbed the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggata, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"There was no way to contact Donggala for information", said Nugroho.
"More than 300,00 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but the situation could get worse", he said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media a man on the high floor can be heard yelling at people on the street below warning them that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes a wall of water was hitting the shore, carrying buildings away.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palou making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but those who have had to flee their homes are in real need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
Over 800 have died in the Indonesian Tsunami.
She's a terrible writer.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have reached Palu City safely, where the workers are sheltering in tarpolin sheds set up in their office yard, they passed by turbulent scenes on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they have seen many houses destroyed", he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups embark on the uncomplicated process of providing emergency aid, some have complained that specialized foreign aid workers have been prevented from traveling to Palou.
According to Indonesian regulations, no funding, supplies or staff can be provided unless the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the state level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster, we can get international help, but no status yet".
As she slept in Palermo for the second time after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were hoping that their loved ones were alive through some miracle, which would alleviate the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a carriage.
On Sunday, rescuers were able to free a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesia national paragliding team coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his students among others are staying at the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional bag", she said.
In the hours after the paragliding community heard the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had closed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a bunch of WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
But there was only one grass stake next to his messages, instead of two blue stakes.
"I think that means the messages have not been sent", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as the ATM machine is refilled in Newport on the Levee
Early Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been tampering with an ATM machine at the entertainment complex, preparing to provide additional funds, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw many other people fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number involved.
Anyone with information on who these people are should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally identified as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called Ye since he used the name as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He's going on the show in place of Ariana Grande, the American singer who pulled out for emotional reasons, says the show's creator.
As well as being a student of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'chi'", West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, who was presenting it on the radio.
So this is you, this is us, this is us.
The name went from Kanye, meaning the only one, to You Only reflecting the good, the bad and the ugly, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are.
Among many other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to collaborate with West, has also been using his name as it varies in terms of ending and the prerequisites.
AMLO in Mexico pledged not to use troops against civilians
Mexico's incumbent President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use troops against civilians as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloodbath against students.
On Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Soldiers opened fire during a peaceful demonstration on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, as left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are attracted to crime gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, although the US generally does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, which aims to be the best country in the world in all innovation by 2030.
"Securing double funding for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less developed than the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
The doubling of funding could mean a doubling of the opportunity to ensure that the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the artificial intelligence system that made America's best player Othello.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next spotters.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"China doesn't take the academic leaders; it takes the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recently tried to recruit bright college graduates to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. to reinforce its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe green cards should be automatically offered to people with expertise in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government institutions provide funding to researchers from the USA, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence is being formed.
And this month DARPA announced an investment in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in Artificial Intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a dialect called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gyorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot is: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain access to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures a safer life for all of us", Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, many MPs have said they will wait for the result of the vote to make it a definitive vote.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The provincial election commission said there was no mention of any irregularities by 1pm.
However, only 16 percent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and Dushko's son voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, a change that would mean that the country could join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of a tent set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the door of the servants", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will ensure much needed investment in Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the outcome would determine our future.
According to a poll set up last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, passing all Brighton defenders and scoring
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling scolded Brighton defenders during Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made an easy look as he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green hills.
He kicked one defender off before running faster than many others on the Brighton boxing edge.
He then threw a left-handed pitch, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick in the box to return the ball to Aguero, and used his right shoe to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We had discussed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that time.
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's possession that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the back row to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before Sterling led to the next post.
The Chelsea forward kicked the ball into the net before slipping over the boundaries.
Manchester City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League play-off group at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer for playing against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have no hope of competing in the second chance games, there is little reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer is hoping to stand on the sidelines on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in terms of second-chance games for the Rockies, which would save the Los Angeles Dodgers from a one-game lead in the NL West.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to secure their spot in the first group.
Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can turn the rubber knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level that we will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a game like that?
The Nationals haven't announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they're reportedly keen to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would throw in his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher for Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is racing in Northern Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his choice for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and he spoke of the importance of the Republican Assembly in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be in the November issue.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
This is one of the great, great ones. I don't fight, but I really fight, that's why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates.
Trump went ahead, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to take back the power by using whatever means necessary, you see the hostility, the malaise.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to be slaughtered for power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are trying to resist and stop.
"And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "bullshit and stupid and untruthful and false".
He referred to the name of senior Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a high-pitched cheer was heard among the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a second -- that was an example of bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a popular party.
The party does not tolerate those who say what they say.
When the Momentum executives in my local party voted to vote for me, it was a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest of many Labour MEPs to hear that we are not welcome - that is to say, welcome.
My fellow congresswoman, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for her resolute stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the offer of a warrant was to blame me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagree with him on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are issues similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circle.
The announcement for the Nottingham Eastern Labour meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been such a meeting.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in most meetings today and we have long forgotten the promise of a more kind, more tolerant politics, if ever.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour party and each view is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I used to think were of the same political persuasion as me were starting to expect me to take a stand and support positions I would never have agreed with otherwise - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I actually say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the politics of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are targeted at me tend to be political.
I admire the professional and determined nature of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but don't let it get the best of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not as popular a party now and with every attempt to protect confidence or change the electoral rules, the party gets more and more lost.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my opinion too strongly, then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I've chosen to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, hired by the Thatcher government, the government responsible for the turbulent state of my joint school classroom, and since then I have tried to promote better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
I don't think anyone in East Nottingham could have misled me on my political views and the areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader as the country moves towards a Brexit that will be a blow to families, businesses and our public services.
But, in fact, I have not a message for Momentum Nottingham, but a message for my constituents, Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats of my impartiality or political hypocrisy will prevent me from acting in the way I believe is best for you all.

38 - 17 Melrose: The snow is falling on the top
Two late bids may have somehow clouded the final outcome, but it is clear that Ayr deserves to win this Tennent League game.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, their excellent defensive work, as well as their work of exploiting opportunities, was responsible for keeping the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but nobody has beaten us, so I have to be satisfied", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to compliment Ayr, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute shot, converted by Frazier Climo, secured Ayr's lead, but the yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, meant Melrose could take advantage of that and Jason Baggot's shot without a shot.
Climo ensured Ayr never got ahead with a penalty, before he, before half-time exactly, scored and converted a single run to secure a 17-5 score for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's bid, which was overturned by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a bit of a delay because Robert Knott had been seriously injured, and was carried away on a stretcher. After they restarted, Ayr had more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Then, Ayr's interim captain, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card, and yet, Melrose made the extra player pay with an unchanged cheque from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Hutchinson's Stran was given a yellow card for hitting Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind Ayr to increasing scares.
Climo reversed the bid, as he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's fox-cat and sent forward Gregor Henry off from the home team's fifth bid.
Seren Still Game is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is hoping to move into the hospitality industry after he learns he's been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, alongside writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show's history and Kiernan is likely planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
No seas: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of the regimental cladin in La Paz.
Public buildings wave banners like the sea.
The maritime centers of the Titicaca River in the Amazon are painted with the slogan: "We are the sea through the right".
It's a duty to restore it.
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the ferry that was lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict lives on - as does the promise of a Pacific voyage again.
These hopes are more pronounced than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has momentum, a sense of unity and tranquility, and for good reason it is eager to wait for the result", said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat from Bolivia.
Many Bolivian citizens will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim - after decades of speculative talks - that Chile must negotiate an open sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic and fraternal president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - is heavily reliant on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and not much would change if the court did.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has insisted that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICC's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was a complex one, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean who specializes in international law.
And instead of improving the situation in Bolivia, the last four years may have made it worse.
"The current Bolivian administration has been obstructed on this issue of access to the sea", said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent dictatorship has undermined any goodwill left by Chile, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold negotiations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to the Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision-making process is usually a quick one.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement over cultural benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Marales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders - was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to realise that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says it won't get rid of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never be rid of its nuclear weapons unless the ball is put in Washington's hands first.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the idea that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to ending the Korean War will make the North surrender is just a nightmare.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement before Pyongyang makes significant disengagement moves first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are about to have a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about surrendering weapons that the country most likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the latest collection of enormous women's clothing is about to reach your High Street
If you want another hat or if you want to block out the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a huge and impressive range of headwear for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which was glittering on the styling set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the incredible credits of these designers have been seen on the fashion stage.
One of Valentino's striking items was a linen hat over a leather top with a curved edge of a powdered cloth covering the models' heads.
Other great accessories included watermelons adorned with toys, a magic hat and even a pin-up - but these hats wouldn't warm your head.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of strange fears - and that in good time for Winter Solstice.
Many of the colourful seasons had veins fused together and were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than to the work of a master.
One of them was like a screw-blower's suit with a snorcel and goggles, and another looked like a conch-shaped jacket, and that one had been topped.
And, if you enjoy big fashion statements- this is your chance.
Those who keep an eye on the trend predict that huge bonnets could reach your main street.
These large hats follow the style of La Bomba, the popular grass hats with a two-foot-wide waistline, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic label behind these unconventional hats seen on social media also had another big creation on the fashion stage - a bag of grass almost as big as the model in a swimsuit who was wearing it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia rim and white leather handle, was one of the most impressive items in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big beach hats and bags hit the high street next summer - with the designer having made so much of an impression, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, but that is supplemented by individual and collective achievement in the areas of sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a leading school curriculum, we see modern languages still being popular subjects of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it will stay in their mind.
If you speak to someone in their own language, it will stay in your heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone in trying to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of recent examinations this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and include the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a high A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72% of pupils have achieved an A-level in Mandarin, with 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish achieving an A-level.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Now languages, as subjects, are treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that lack of language skills was responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is an increased demand for languages to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities projected to require languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of obtaining such a long-term qualification.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will be one step ahead immediately.
According to a poll by YouGov involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they will teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK as it looks around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, and the schools will have teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and their children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied that at present, in a global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as skills of international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien to watch.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the season before the season opens on Sunday at the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play again.
"It's going to be more than one but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers coach Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this point in my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
West Virginia Rally time Trump, YouTube channel
President Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies planned for next week, including visits to friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his nomination for the Supreme Court delayed, Trump is seeking to rally support for the midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
The Trump rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings on his Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who is under strain as allegations of sexual misconduct with his confirmation vote in the Senate have been delayed by up to a week until the FBI investigates.
But the main aim of the series of rallies is to help Republicans facing tough elections in November gain some momentum.
So, the Trump campaign said that the five rallies over the next week would aim to "spark up volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and add to their majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to our agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we begin the important campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not identify himself, told Reuters.
Held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get Pittsburgh media attention, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican congressman Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come here to try to get him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show the pot to fight on as they head to Sunday's singles matches
After three one-eighth sessions, Saturday afternoon's quarterfinal may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been imagined in the sports world but it is a concept that the players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the momentum is right now?
"They were ahead by six points and now it's four, so we have a little bit of momentum for me", said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the board with another twelve to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their moods and have enough to encourage them, especially by Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four.
Speith has been excellent since you came to the grass and he leads by example.
The scrapers of celebration went higher as his round went ahead, succeeding with a crucial point to go on a game to fourth even though he o'clocked and Thomas had been down two after two.
There was a similar crash after the pit that won them the game on the 15th, the kind of crash that tells you that I don't think America is out of it yet.
"You have to focus and worry about your own game", Speith said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unforgettable Ryder Cup story.
A couple of old but lovely Europeans have four for four and they're doing nothing wrong.
Mollywood was the only bar that didn't have a Saturday afternoon, and they didn't have a Saturday morning, Thursday afternoon or the last nine of Friday morning.
That run, and the way the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, which would be the same player more popular to confirm a European victory in the title over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both at the same price on different tiles.
But it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson put Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, off easy when he was paired with Alex Noren.
After a draw and two doubles in the first nine the Spaniard and the Swede were in a hole they came nowhere near climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four pillars and the four games are interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in a second.
So far Europe has played better as a team and they are leading rather well at the start of the last day, but the four-match session has proven that Team USA has the ability to fight, something that some in the USA in particular doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe have a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and four-way match 10-6 ahead of the USA.
The incredible pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two wins over Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn, who were trying to regain the trophy after losing in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the poor American side in the morning's four-match series to take the series 3-1.
The USA put up more opposition in the quarterfinals, but they could not get rid of the deficit.
Jim Furyk's squad needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the lead.
Fleetwood is the first European club to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after an incredible weekend, are the second bar to have four points from four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After Woods and Patrick Reed scored in all four balls they teamed up to beat Woods on American rookie Bryson Starters by 5 and 4.
Wood, who has himself kicked two goals in two games on Saturday, has some special chances but has lost 19 of 29 games in four straight four-and-a-half-and-seven.
Justin Rose, disqualified for the morning's four balls, returned as partner to Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka first and third in the world by 2 and 1.
Everything went Europe-pro on a nice, sunny day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four-ball and later outscored Polter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points behind at the start of individual matches, although only a draw is needed for the Furyk squad as they are the holders of the cup.
But, after being away for two days, coming into their light on Sunday looked as if it were beyond their ability.
North Korea says they won't unilaterally recognize without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions strengthened misgivings in the US and that the country would not be unilaterally disposed of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea has taken significant goodwill steps in the past year, such as halting nuclear drills and launches, decommissioning a nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But we have not seen such a response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot first educate ourselves.
Although Ri had repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual response to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement was significant as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization entirely as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee the security of Korea.
North Korea has been trying to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US is demanding 'denuclearization first' and is increasing the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and they are even opposed to the declaration to end the war", RI said.
The idea that sanctions can overwhelm us is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions reinforce our misgivings.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the president had already hosted at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five days and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of denuclearization and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not lead to such an impossible situation".
Yet Ri's speech was a far cry from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US with North Korean rockets was hopeless after "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim a "rocket" on a self-imposed mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was much work to be done and that sanctions must wait until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific timeline for this, saying if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN General Assembly on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must be enforced firmly and relentlessly until we realize and affirm complete denuclearization".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to restrict funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Ri met Pompeo on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go as well.#
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him within hours of making "gangster-like" judgments.
North Korea has promised to meet Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility if the U.S. takes similar measures.
He said Kim told him that the "Cuppetballs" he was asking about were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with the US.
Harvard students get a course on getting plenty of rest
A new course at Harvard University is getting undergraduates to sleep more this year in an attempt to tackle the macho culture of studying all night using caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's best universities often misunderstand when it comes to the basics themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital who designed the course, believes it is the first of its kind in the US.
He was initially inspired by a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only learning this now, in my final year?"
He said no one had told me about the importance of sleep - it was surprising to me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being introduced for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee mugs, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what smoking does to your health", Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressures on students mean that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, and that's quality, should be a way for students to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid putting pressure on, because lack of sleep makes the brain think you're sluggish, making you wet all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after studying one of the courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to try to have the course for the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competing organisation.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting alarms for going to bed, as well as for waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: goal by Menga beating Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor away game as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's untied team at Livingstone.
Ibrox were looking for their first win on the road since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's Gerrard's team conceded just the second free kick in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind Ladbrokes' top league leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no prospect of being able to draw.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingstone rises to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the announcer Calum Spence had to undergo surgery for a head injury after something was thrown from the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that helped Ayr reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 that beat Hearts last week and would be pleased with the way his regular squad beat their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the ball when they had it.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance to score against Allan McGregor but the midfielder missed his chance by striking the ball clear.
A deep-clear kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back post.
Rangers were in control but there was more hope than faith in their play in the final stretch of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been kicked off the bike after about a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but referee Steven Thomson overturned the appeals of Colombiad.
Rangers had two shots for the goal in the first half but came up short before Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's penalty and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes was against the flow of the game, no one can argue that they were not merited for their hard work alone.
Yet, the Rangers methoded and dealt with Jacobs' deep-playing plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was unnerved when he passed it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was a brake as he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change almost took effect immediately as the scorer passed to Morelos but Kelly rattled his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving long balls after long balls.
Holt's carriage could have added to their score in the final minutes but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow missed a penny from the corner.
Rangers' second baseman Glenn Middleton had another request for a motorcycle lock after an altercation with Jacobs but Thomson rejected the request again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger
And now a page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and on CURRENT... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring polarity, a development that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger Measurer.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Measurer has become an important part of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans listed as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: Where in the world is this?
Rogers: Geiger meters, they're used to find volatile minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms being released by the magnetic fields in the mines.
Well, it makes a lot of noise!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device named after him continues to be used.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see foreign cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill foreign cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
Then they'll be able to see a protein that's common in many cancers and they'll be re-injected.
A trial of the vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein called HER2 that is common in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 causes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and learning how to target cancer cells has worked to treat some types of leukemia.
Following his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a Trump-sponsored march wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't do well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a grueling performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for President in 2020.
After performing his third one that night, Ghost Town, wearing the Make America Great Again cap, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support of Trump.
I'd talk to white people and they'd say, "How could you like Trump, is he racial?
Well, if I was worried about race I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, a video of West was managed to be uploaded to social media by the hacker Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to disgrace West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
They were pushing me behind the stage.
They said, "He will come out with the head down".
They were mocking me!
Then they say I'm in low place, he said, then according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead and said, "Do you want to see the low point?" saying that he would postpone my Superman link, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His comments were echoed at least twice by the SNL audience and cast members were eager to see, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication: "The studio was all quiet".
West was added as a late addition to singer Ariana Grande, as his ex-girlfriend rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West caused a stir by performing I Love It while wearing a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who remarked: "One of the characters I'm talking about is: DO NOT HAVE A WRONG ENTRY".
But host Karen Hunter admitted that West was just being himself and that was great.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and expressing ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are too", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
She and rapper Snoop Dogg were named Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince changed his name to Symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after a restaurant break-in in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The storm happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of Game of Thrones Kit Harington is killing off a toxic husband
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has slapped the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something had gone wrong and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic men in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he feels strongly about tackling the problem.
I feel strongly at the moment - what's gone wrong with men? she said.
What have we been teaching men as they have grown up, in terms of the problem we have now?
Kit also believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in male-toxicity due to the very masculine characters.
And he said unto him, What is salvation, and what is teaching?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel they have to be a special kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our lifetime -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.
In the interview he admitted that he would not do any more Game of Thrones shows when the series ends next summer, saying he had "lost enough on battles and horses".
From November Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing he heard from Game of Thrones.
"I met a woman on the show, so in a way she gave me my family, and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest as Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
Some 40,000 new cases were identified in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of cases were transmitted through sex, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of Cyprus as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost nothing, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But, year by year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased from 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions of infections are the result of inadequate sexual safety in these relatives.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked data on Republican lawmakers, killing off dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three Republican Senators to lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being spread by far-right candidates.
"Lies, lies, and more lies", Walters said in a statement to Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information leaked online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information from a Waters staff member, the Hill reported.
"This baseless allegation is false and a blatant lie", Waters said.
The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible in any way for the release of this information.
This unfounded accusation is false and a blatant lie.
Waters's statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is a boring joke", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests she has no nature to be a Member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they did not do, they do not get upset.
They are not to be classified.
They left no question of the suspect's motives.
They must be quiet and unconcerned.
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters's response to the Democrats' judgment of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by jurors of appearing to be nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
"If it is true", he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had notified the appropriate authorities and the law enforcement agency of the fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he said, "and that they are held accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - parody of weak spy with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new British-themed film and to find it suitable for this revival of the Johnny English comedy-drama series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deception speak in the embrace of how sober we shall be in the opportunity to export the new nation?
However, the innocent Johnny English has been licensed to destroy everything again for the second time - with his name more than suggesting that he is a comic character created for movie-goers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, the true spy who despite his many claims includes a little Clouseau, Mr Bean, was a man who contributed one note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally based on the traveling mystery man played by Atkinson in a Barclaycard commercial, leaving a devastating legacy.
There's a good scene or two in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved watching Johnny English go up to a helicopter wearing armor and the rotor blades hit against his helmet.
Atkinson's dance with physical comedy is to be seen, but the humor is weak and strangely unnecessary, especially now that serious films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's truth-telling misdeeds are not as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in the Bean character.
The contemporary view is that Great Britain is in big trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all the British spies in the field, despite the fact that the undercover chief is on duty - an unfortunate and minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step for a self-righteous and surrounded prime minister who is already suffering from massive political uncertainty. Emma Thompson does her best with the character of Teresa Maya, but there is little in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all spies have been compromised and that she will be bringing someone out of retirement.
And this includes Johnny English himself, who is working as a schoolmaster in some shitty institution now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, while English runs a spy school similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to an overseas ship commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is wasted.
So Batman and Robin get things wrong back at Her Majesty's service, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being wooed by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can handle Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their hilarious journey: dressed as servants, they set a French restaurant on fire; create a storm while trying to get on the infamous Volta; and English causes total disorder while trying to use a virtual device to make contact inside Volta's house.
They make a great show of it in the last scene, but as fun and uncomfortable as it is, there's a little bit of a sense of children's television about the whole thing.
Very sweet.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes fair play with her talents?
The Labour Party denied it was preparing a plan for the British people to work four days a week but be paid for five days
Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would mean that British people work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants CEOs to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would mean that workers would have a three-day week - but the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of the workers.
A change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but the four-day week is an ambition that is consistent with the party's attitude towards restructuring the economy on the part of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present the ambition is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's party conference to expand his vision for socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from the "unnamed directors and "professors" of the public resource companies.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders of water companies will not get their money back as the Labour government could make 'convictions' based on apparent malfeasance.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and created Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of company equity; the private sector would be in the hands of workers, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, investigator Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to seeing me than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I told you before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, I said, "Did you do this?"
He was definite, determined and unflinching.
However, Graham's vote to see is firm.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a terrible charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett was totally against it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one could confirm her name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is World Urban Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Urban Festival, an annual music event with an impressive roster of stars participating and a message that is equally impressive: end poverty worldwide.
Now in its seventh year, the World Urban Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the festival's main goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Urban Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Action Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else of value to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the World Urban Festival been with only 12 years to go to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to want change or just another case of "clicktivism" - people feel they're making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a cheat?
Since 2011, the World Urban Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million activities by its supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to publish commitments and policies that amount to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In mid-2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and disclosures derived from its actions, with at least $10 billion of that being classified and/or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and operators committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 47,00 trials from World Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, stakeholders, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a milestone in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after over 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, they asked what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
The World Urban Day responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the ship for "warfare" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can use the ship if necessary to block Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as speculated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to deal with energy the way they do in Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe", he was quoted as saying.
And, according to the officer, there are ways to address this.
"The United States has the ability, with shipping, to make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to put in place safeguards to ensure that they don't reach the market", he said.
Zinke was greeting the audience at an event being hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure on and replace fuel", he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for downstream consumers in Europe.
Since then, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "impossible" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says is making Berlin a liability to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 Billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is merely an economic project and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion we share the belief that energy cannot be used to impose pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has prompted a lukewarm response from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's top industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it hard" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "hardly consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will consider hard to run for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "warning the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been unrelenting in his advocacy of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
But a pennant poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents did not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand behind the pine pole of the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported such an effort.
The pennant poll showed much more support for an attempt by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible attempt and 48 percent against.
Other Democratic names that have been rumored as possible candidates for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin is referring to PTSD Track Palin in Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, lost a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can empathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the trauma that some of our veterans are coming back with", he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephants in the room" and said of his son and other former soldiers, "They come back different, they come back stronger and they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the armed forces have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 provinces and D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies nudity to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. delivered a companion-of-the-court briefing Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who defied police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, has not been disclosed.
He said his partner, "a violent son of gang members", had been treated badly but U.S. officials denied his prosecution for bribery on July 20.
He was held in the detention center in Nhexas.
Grace described the provincial tours that support El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries that face major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum if they were fleeing domestic violence.
District of Columbia State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy  ignores decades of provincial, federal and international law.
"Federal law requires that any request for a writ of mandamus be awarded on the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such an impediment would be contrary to that principle", the brief said.
The tournaments further argued that the brief under the policy of barring immigrants from entering the U.S. economy was damaging, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to provide essential labor.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Shelter was not meant to alleviate all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Palma as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly critical.
"I feel very worried", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her sick son at a refugee center in Palu.
Every minute an ambulance comes and bodies come in.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their muddy property, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who had broken her back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where they were being treated in the open air due to severe back pain.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the feeling of the earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US embassy accuses Tsiena of bullying with propaganda messages
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily promoting U.S.-China trade benefits, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily's addition to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, accusations that China denies.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in US elections was a new step in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place trade-promoting notices, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an escalating trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, US and Chinese experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now confirming that bullying by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important traditions of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by putting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find dissenting voices and you would not see a very reflective of the varying ideas that the Chinese people have about the economic path of China's concerns, as the press is under the umbrella of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had declined the offer to publish his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn Republicans Are Exiling Women Who Vote Before the Midterm Elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
While many progressive Republicans support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on record are already saying they want to go ahead with the vote.
You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) last-minute effort to get an FBI investigation would be enough to quell disgruntled voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Early Friday, protesters shouted "November Man Comes!" as they protested in the Senate courtyard as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the Democrats is going to be immense", Stu Rothenburg, a political analyst at the news site, told the news site.
People say they're already enthusiastic; it's true.
But it could increase, especially among insecure women on the outskirts of towns and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony described his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analyses suggested that a strong response would follow if Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed into a complete Republican coup", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and this is the way they've treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided as to who they will vote for following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a bit more anger toward Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41% of respondents either believe Ford's testimony or not, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believe it is certain or likely that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's crackdown, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in a bench trial before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, stole her genitals while they were at a party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to connect with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new project of the technology pioneer, Inrupt, is a company that builds on an open source platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In a selected interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee denied that the Inrupt company's intention was to "rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the company.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and together at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data store is that it is up to the user who is being seen what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the Company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help ensure that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he is not the only team talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are completely overturned overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the diversity of the Internet.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Foundation.
"I'm very hopeful about this next week in the history of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the clergy of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England cleric to win the Victoria Cross as a combatant in the First World War has been commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
The Reverend Lieutenant-General Bernard Vanny won a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two sons at a funeral in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said it was highly symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat that won him the grand prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 Lieutenant-General Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through heavy fog and attacks from field arrows and machine guns.
Later he marched to the dance line and with the greatest courage led the line forward before rushing to the field on his own and looting three of the crew.
Lieutenant-General Vann was killed by a German artillery shell on 4 October 1918 - a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father's actions were something "I can never compare to but it's humiliating".
He and the Doctor's brother James Vann set a torch after the raid, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the campaign" adding "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support being given by so many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pink in his place.
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206 only to be banned from the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 corners, including a checkered flag and was shown live through the target in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, UK viewers were left stunned as the screen changed to Peppa Pink.
Some were unhappy about staying up all night especially to watch the forest.
One fan on Twitter described the change to day care as some kind of bad joke.
"Government regulations said content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so we had to switch to children's programming", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
The pig's paper, yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their schedule as it includes UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the re-release, we can make it work", Coker said.
Now it is the sixth hour of the morning, and we cannot go out until it is the seventh hour, the time of the week.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five corners instead of six - as usual - we didn't try to give the fans too much and it was a long run.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Plumber Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he didn't realize until he went to high school that everyone was like me.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was speaking out for gay rights in order to give other people hope.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less than everyone else growing up" because she was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
She said: "Today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and the strength to overcome.
He wanted to prove himself something, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they came to know about his piety.
The two-time Olympic medalist has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to abolish same-sex marriage.
He said he made his decision because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without implications and because he wanted to give hope to others.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was unexpected.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
When someone goes through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had lived through similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal", he said.
But there are more things than winning Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
I can't tell you're not going to be around to be in the front row, either", he said.
I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and he was dead that I recognized that he was not an anarchist", she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to shine in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, it didn't feel better", she said.
He also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which he had been wearing since before the Olympic games and was still giving it a goose bump.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid an unfortunate mile stone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the quarter-finals and quarter-finals.
Rather than being in the middle of the action, as he has been so often in the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, divided his day between being a fan and working on his game in the hope of improving his problems.
As the fastest driver was not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a good choice for the Le Golf National drag course, where the long curve punishes brutal shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood's rookie of the week to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely vital.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, though he could do nothing else.
"He understood his role today, he put my back and his arm off my compass and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but then it worked out and then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the high points of his solo record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, although Furyk says his presence is an undeniable boost to the team.
"He's unfair, sarcastic, verbal, he likes to make people laugh, he's a great person to have in the team room", he explained.
I think the young players are having fun making fun of himself too, this week, which was nice to see.
It contributes much more than just experience.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that a large fortune could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a substantial profit before the final day of individual matches in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes had their first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage was down to a silver lining with Europe winning by 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"Remember that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won only from a purple dust", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You must try your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
Nothing's over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the cup, and that's where we're going to focus.
I've said from the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what we stand for - the best players in the world.
Pleased with the way his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never be proud of this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come first, and that's something completely different to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there by yourself, you're pretty much tested as a golfer.
That's the message I need to get to the players, do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too.
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the big wins on the final day, as he was part of the team that won in Brookline before losing to Europe after securing the title in Medina.
"I remember every word of it", he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had promoted his players before the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We set up our line so and put the men out as we want, we try to do something amazing tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I came with this group of players in this order because I think they will work well all the way", Bjorn said of his selection for the individual games.
New German warship has been refitted once again
Germany's new frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but won't be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but post-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will reportedly include powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile arrays along with some top-secret technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and low-pitched sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - new refrigerators should be able to be checked for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continued delays mean that the innovative warships - which will allow Germany to throw its power over the sea - will be out of service by the time they are ready, Die Zeit said.
The F125 refrigerator was in the headlines last year, after the German Navy refused to commission the ship and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to shipbuilders after it had been supplied.
The reasons behind the ship's return were unclear, but German media cited a number of critical software and hardware flaws that meant the warship was useless if she had to fight.
Software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
It also became apparent that the ship's overweight sounded detrimental to its performance and reduced the Fleet's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as large as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the poor hardware, the price for the whole project - including training the crew - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2billion initially.
The problems of the new refrigerators are becoming ever more important given recent warnings that the power of the German banking system is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Ship was "run out of traceable ships".
The official said the problem has worsened over time, as old ships have been decommissioned without new ships being provided in their place.
He insisted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of the underprivileged
New research is being carried out at a site in the Scottish Highlands which seeks to reveal how ostriches use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the unique mammalian behaviour and will help with future conservation activities.
The study by Scottish National Trust scientists will follow the commonest minor strings on the minor soprano strings along with the long-eared strings and the water strings at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the site to keep track of the activity of the sprinters throughout the season.
The NHS volunteers and staff will also conduct mobile surveys using hand sensors.
A specialist sound analysis of the recordings will determine the frequency of the calls made by the birds and what species are doing what.
A report and a map of the habitats will then be produced to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the Scottish National Trust, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for the islands and how they are used by each species.
The information will help to identify the benefits of forest management work such as creating forests and how to manage forests for weasels and other related species.
Stamp populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development which affects their lives and leads to the loss of their homes.
Wind turbines and hail can also be dangerous, along with paper trapping and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
The blind are not blind.
But because they are nocturnal their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to see the gaps and obstacles ahead.
The National Trust for Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and over 76,000 hectares across the country and they are very concerned about pollution.
They have ten trained specialists, who carry out regular surveys, visits to the cattle and periodic surveys.
The organisation has established Scotland's first butterfly sanctuary on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten butterfly species.
Stadium manager David Thompson said the stadium's landscape was perfect for them.
Here in Threave we have a great area for the strolls", he said.
We have many old buildings, many old woods and all the good trees.
But there's a lot we don't know about insects, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what's needed for humans to thrive.
It emphasises looking for insects before any maintenance work is carried out in buildings as one insect colony could destroy up to 400 female and juvenile insects, possibly killing the entire local population.
Animals are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Wildlife Conservation Trust, has been urging the public to lend a hand.
He said: 'We have so much to learn about our insects and with so many of our species we don't know whether their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of violence as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him "fake news", saying people were trying to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were corroborated, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they say today, fake news, is what a five-time Ballon d'Or winner says to the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, waving.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called an unacceptable "concern of suspicion in a private matter", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for a moral level of vigilance commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious human rights offences in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were allegedly returned to the player's room, where he raped her on the record, according to the papers filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo jumped on her lines after the alleged incident and told her that he was a good guy who was disappointed by the one hundred.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but he was consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of pay and was worried about her public embarrassment.
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to overturn the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Fanconi United when the alleged attack happened, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK would regret losing carmakers for good
The UK would forever regret losing its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would temporarily stop producing cars at its Burnaston factory near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", said Mr Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said delays at the border could lead to job losses if there was no deal.
The Burnaston factory - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and almost 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain were to leave the EU at the end of March, construction would stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said that they will close their Mini factory in London for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what carmakers say are risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "only on time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars that are built to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be problems at the border, problems that industry says would lead to delays and shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so construction would have to be halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU had been carefully designed to avoid those checks at the border.
We want to get the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity", he told Radio 4's Today programme.
THOYOTA and other manufacturers are showing that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery chains that have been very successful.
Toyota could not say how long the production would end, but in the long term, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and would ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience once these jobs are gone they won't come back".
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
A key meeting between Donald Trump and U.S. Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will remove the deputy national chairman, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been on Washington's agenda for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a recorder to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of getting rid of the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, because he said he was going to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would have preferred not to dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women he accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that it will be postponed for another week because of all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But let's see if I always like to give the latest information to the press.
Some reporters would question that claim: Sanders hasn't held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace explained why.
Sanders said that disrespect for the OCC was not the reason for the lack of briefing, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are OCC".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, adding without citing any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers".
Sanders said he would continue briefing, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks.
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting officials.
Individual press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, making a grim and sometimes outrageous appearance in front of reporters.
The Health Secretary writes to EU staff at the Scottish NHS over concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation for the country and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, with decisions expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been intensifying preparations for the possibility of a 'no-deal' situation.
I know this is sure to be an uncertain time for each of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we wish you very much to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the team's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Rees told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the side line and some kind of wimped out there", said Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and returning him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the nature of the injury or how bad the injury was again and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt freshman, is in his first season with the Tennessee Titans after being traded from Illinois.
He had five tackles in all on Saturday before being forced to leave the game, bringing the season's total to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to support homelessness under the Tories' new plans.
This proposal will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be given to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that overseas buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those earning big salaries.
The increase in stamp duty will be given to individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK.The additional money will boost the Government's intention to tackle people who sleep outside.
The surcharge - which is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-and-let homes - could be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this proposal to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of brand new properties in London are bought by residents from outside the UK, and this increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "desert towns" because so many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to stop quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn has announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to the eviction of homeless people.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year, I said I would devote my work as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would improve for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that buying a home is as easy for non-UK individuals, as well as companies based abroad, as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is far from being within their reach, and the dread of sleeping out on the street remains far too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to be manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scot is pushing for the challenge of reviving the North West club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it", Ross told Sportsound, the BBC's Scottish programme.
When I was a child, I grew up watching the Scots in Hampden quite a lot with my father, and it's something that's stuck with me ever since.
That opportunity will only come to me if I am successful in managing the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of following such strong names at such a big club, and he has turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success at this moment will be to see if I can lead this club back to the top flight".
"Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the top league without a doubt", he said.
It won't be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless I could get the club back there.
It is only three years since Ross began his managerial career, having spent time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped lift Alloa after they were relegated to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from relegation to top the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a rather important point", he said as he remembered taking the oats in Alloa.
I was really convinced that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds like because I did the right thing, I did the reasonable thing, and I got a little bit to the top.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through that in terms of the stress and the workload but the control feels great.
I always wanted to be a manager and having achieved that, I now feel more fulfilled than ever.

The perfect time for a curtain call is 5.30 on a Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot summer weather has boosted hard-to-get British retail earnings, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bar and tavern groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but saw a 4.8 percent decline in dining-house profits, according to figures.
Peter Martin from the CGA business consultancy that collected the figures said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England have stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern quite similar to June and July, where parties saw an increase of 2.8 per cent, but the dining halls have suffered the most.
After the 1.8 percent drop in the dining-house trade in June, things got worse in July.
Taverns and bars selling drinks performed best seeing more gains than dining houses saw losses.
Parks that focus on selling food also suffered because of the sun, though not as much as people who run eateries.
It seemed that going out for a drink was just what people wanted to do.
Across the controlled bars and pubs, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in beverage sales for the month, while there was a 3 per cent decrease in food.
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analytics firm RSM said: 'These results show a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain major factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that dining-house groups are still suffering, although a reduction of 4.8 per cent year on year is sure to be painful as well as weighing on ongoing costs.
The long summer could not have come at a bad time for people running restaurants focused on selling food, and the uncertain time when a more moderate August temperature will provide some much needed rest.
In July, there was a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in bars and restaurants, including new ones opened, reflecting the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK pub and dining sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "book" to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "proper" account to show to parents, while some had private ones as well.
One mother came across the hiding place of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a teenager encouraging others to rape me.
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, has found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers are unable to find".
Doyle will next be the Athletes' Voice on the Scottish Athletes' board.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletes as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from the wide range of experience she has gained at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is held in high regard across the Scottish athletic community, the UK and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from having him on the table", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of his four other Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a temporary bout of ischemia.
He tweeted: "I went back today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It's been a struggle but I've made a complete recovery, I've learned how to walk again and today I'm doing the stuttering exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!
There is a wide range of opinions online about pump ads that almost compare mothers to cattle
There is a wide range of opinions online following an advertisement by a pump company that almost compares breastfeeding mothers to cattle being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being called the world's first wearable near-distancing pump, technical goods company Elvie has released a cellware ad in the form of a music video to show the freedom the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dancing in a broomstick and cattle in it, to a song that includes words like: "Yes, I'm awake, but you don't see a combo" and "I'm afraid you didn't notice, these aren't pears, they're dreams".
And the proverb in front of it is, "Pump out, pump out, I feed the baby, pump out, pump out, I touch the baby".
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been the subject of an online fire.
With 77,000 people having seen the video and hundreds having commented, it has received a mixed response among viewers, with some saying it does not convey the dairy industry's "heritage" seriously.
A very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them within days of giving birth", one wrote.
A pump almost fits Elvie and the view from inside a nurse's brother (Elvie/Mom)
Another said: "It's understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump near mothers who are keeping their babies?
And another added, "A man who does not understand the world is a man".
Others were defending the ad, and one woman admitted she saw the song as "overly offensive".
This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I hadn't been eating from the breast.
The pump made me feel just like a box.
The ad was a bit hurtful but I took it for what it was.
This is a fantastic product, wrote one
Another said: "This is a fun-filled podcast aimed at moms who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like cattle".
The advertisement does not praise or criticize the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their arms.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump their breasts feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie pump is completely unobtrusive, has no wick or tubing and fits snugly inside a nursing brush, giving girls the freedom to move, to care for their babies, and even to go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother said: Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a prominent launch and a great prize.
By showing the similarity between the breast pump and the cow pump we wanted to highlight the breast pump and all the challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in a timely and relevant way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Muddy Kids Moved to Camp on the Texas Border
The number of orphans kept from fleeing has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly because the austerity and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been immigrants themselves without the right to be in the country, and they have worried about jeopardising their right to stay in the country in the process of claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other adults in the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had tried to sponsor underage children without a companion.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of a sponsored household are living in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreign criminals.
So we're continuing to go after those individuals", Mr Albence said.
To process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference call, rather than in person, to plead a case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be sent out of the country without pay.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent bullying or an attempt to escape.
Advocates say such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many are struggling with.
Syria is telling the US, France and Turkey's occupied territories to withdraw immediately.
Welcoming the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its longest year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will be dealt with appropriately.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this sacred war until all Syrian territories had been cleared of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops guarding the war-torn country.
In discussing refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were right for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading unreasonable fears that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the process of their return", he said.
They have made a purely humanitarian issue a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a listening post in the last important rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to push ahead with political talks.
As a result of the Russia-Turkey agreement, a major invasion by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live, was avoided.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work would be to "review the existing articles of the constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Accepting that, Mr. Trump could be impeached in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope he is, a high-profile scandal ends his presidency soon.
And that would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic overthrow of a presidency ever!
At present, there are no signs that the spectators are tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million peak-hour viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show has outpaced cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a topic that attracts people because we don't understand it", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another thought.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said of it, 'Because it made me laugh,' said Ms. Scovell to me.
Entertainment is at the center of the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, which can bring immigrant families back together, and the state of the global economy at large.
Only the most privileged viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes beyond being a knowledgeable citizen when you realize you're on the sixth hour watching a panel of experts argue over Bob Woodward's use of the words "deep background" as he traced information for his book "Fear", the $15,000 leather jacket of estranged Paul Manafort (a comedian with too much pride, according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' terrifying descriptions of, in fact, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I personally would never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump show characters being recycled daily in the story arc (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single point or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees out at his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he had been spending time indoors watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
I remember when we were doing all the crazy programs back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western decline", Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth about it is that they were right.

Money out there flows into the midterm election race in the House
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is receiving a cash flow, thanks to congressional redistricting that means two incumbents are in the race for the same seat.
The newly redrawn Pittsburgh mayoral district favours Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps rather closely with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally unfair in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance battle between the main party's funding arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a highly publicized contest in March in a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits say the Democrats are ahead.
U.S. complains about punishing El Salvador for giving support to China, then pulls out
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little to no unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017. He had a hotel in Myanmar until partners turned the Trump Foundation management team out.
State Department officials decided to recall diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent "decisions to deny recognition to Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from America in 2017, which included drug control, economic aid and development.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high rates of unemployment and homicides.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rescheduled a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting held last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, and so put an end to any consideration of sanctioning El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had been tapped to host the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any difficult new messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the debate described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the ministry who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying the History of the World
The next big event may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility that Mr. Trump has obstructed justice, where substantial evidence is now in public records.
Apparently Mr. Mueller also discussed in his report whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability to that body, and he is preparing to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in the long run.
There is a lot of uncertainty involved, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - than his European counterparts.
Choices need to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact throughout the endeavours.
In 1938 German officials were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the west resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the chance to avoid years of conflict.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the journey of democratic destruction is accelerated or slowed.
Americans now face many of these tipping points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper reported last year, that he had suggested recording the president in secret and disingenuously disguising himself as unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
How do we react if the investigation the FBI has just asked about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault allegations and anonymous testimony?
After all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congressional party that will keep Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, it will be difficult for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was about to take over my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table that showed the swastika.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is a fiery pre-game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians, following the draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, means they are in a good position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury meant Graham Dorrans was out of action this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but I think the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something and we came away with a point.
We might have beaten at the end but, overall, a draw was more than likely a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As for Thursday night, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but with the support of the crowd I am sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
It was definitely a challenging year, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made to the club itself, but it's a nice feeling in place now.
The squad is good and the boys are having a great time; the practice is good.
Hopefully we can keep it up now, forget about last season and succeed.
Women are losing sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although those who took part in the survey had a good idea of how they wanted to receive care, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where it begins.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not tell them your wishes well in advance.
Work with your family counsellor to discuss where and how you can receive care, as these choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
Involve your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can help you think about how to pay for those costs as well.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-added life insurance policy to cover those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Make sure you have healthcare brochures such as appointing a person you trust to oversee your medical care to ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider an attorney for your financial matters.
You would choose a person you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you can afford to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write those details down in a written plan as you prepare.
It's more than financial matters, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Draw that plan.
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.

Officers have described the shooting, which occurred at about 02.30 BST, as a random operation.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
With communications cut off, rescue officers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala prefecture, an area in northern Palu closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palermo, more than 16,000 people have been displaced after the earthquake hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population target of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a sound province stretching along more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The prefecture, an administrative area under a province, had a population target of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic drivers of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the coast on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Meteorological Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Seismic Volcanic Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of South India, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit the province of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and terror as people are reminded of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami was not caused, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok, a tropical island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northwest side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is being arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, failing to report domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took her phone away from him.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Detention Complex and is being held on a $500 bond without protection, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was a god, definitely when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His lover claimed that he had given her a blow to his face.
Sarah Pilan was criticized by ex-servicemen groups in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behavior to PTSD stemming from her time serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds are killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being shared on social media showing the timing of the event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the extreme punishment of the man suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the ultimate punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the horrific New York City attack that killed eight people -- the few punishments not given in the county for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented truck from Home Depot to assault a bike path along Lower Manhattan's West Main Street, beating up pedestrians and cyclists who were in his way in October.
To justify the extreme penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight individuals "intentionally" and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to attempt the extreme penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both courts may impose the maximum penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder for fraud, charges typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of rape and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable deliberation and planning", describing Saipov's attack as "Jewish, cruel and disgusting".
"The Saipov Habibullaevic Sayfullo caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the warning said of the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York introduced the maximum penalty.
The shooter, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a full sentence was handed down in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being found guilty of conspiring to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
They were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked for an ISIS banner in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the ultimate punishment rather than accept a plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole only extends the trauma of these events to all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to seek the extreme punishment.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "act on the people's voice" today during a protest at the Dorian convention.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from MEPs - as one MEP Theresa May herself suggested she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
At the rally in Birmingham, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative backbenchers, said the UK would now leave if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in rearranging her highly fragmented ranks based on the Dorians who are in favour of Aros joining another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is having a hard time keeping his Chequers plan in order amidst attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and EU supporters.
Allies have demanded that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the delay - forcing MEPs and Labour members to choose between her package and the referendum.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to take Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made lord and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have gone out now", he said.
Wellingborough added: I will be in favour of Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.
He stated his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight in the world wars to be equal.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member of the Brexit party, was also at the rally and told respondents: "I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, Mr. Clancy is not going to vote for the scheme, it is unpopular with our party and our active members who are marching the streets to get us elected in the first place.
Don't throw on Chequers and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, he added: 'Chief ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must "feel the pressure" if they are to reverse the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to negotiate Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which is about to negotiate Brexit, feel that pressure.
We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who secured our victory over Brexit and we will continue to do so until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Aros supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory Anti-Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
One of the Labour Lords, Lord Adoins, made a joke about the Conservative leadership over the security issues they had with the party's ap at the opening convention.
"These are the people who are telling us they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for trouble-free borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he said.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren is serious about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP state representative who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
There has been much speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she met with voters for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took office.
Someone present asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a girl at the top.
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a person had been arrested on suspicion of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it has arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the South University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died instantly", Murphy J. Paul, a top police officer, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the site, possessing a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-6, 205-pound youngster who was raised in Baton Rouge, where he played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team's routine helped him win the lead over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team structure would play a big part in the race.
However, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a team member.
Vettel went into the first hole and allowed Hamilton to reach the end of the pack, something that should have been fatal.
The Mercedes went into the pool later in the lap coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, dissatisfied, leaving the inside free in danger of being caught going after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he continued in his diarrhea to try to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen to secure fourth place.
In the end, the bulls came on lap 44 but were unable to increase their speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came in fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was the big man letting me pass.
The team has done a great job to get one two", said Hamilton.
That's a low body language.
President Donald Trump joked about the head of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for admitting she did not share the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "gassy and evil and lying".
The same thing could happen with the blessed thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senedd, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and mean and lying", he said.
When you look at the statements and the documents that are being shared and then they say, "No, I didn't do it".
I did not.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember his answer... you did share the document-- oh, what?
Oh, not at all.
I did not share the document.
Well, wait a minute.
We shared the document...Naddo, we did nothing", he added, citing the senator.
Feinstein received the letter containing details of the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was shared in early September - but Feinstein denied that the letter was shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep the letter to you secret, so I did as she asked.
But the president didn't seem to believe her, and he commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you something, her body language was really bad.
She may not have, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three girls, the president suggested that the Democrats are using the claims against their own officials.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the hatred, the malaise, they don't care who they offend, who they have to beat to get power and control", the president said according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made good on losing in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the match back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team score before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard scored the winning goal for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third time Adam Keefe's men had lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams had met this season, with the Giants having lost the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped to provide Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead at the first break as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, once again, Bouchard ensured they had a level score with a powerful goal for 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to ensure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the highly secretive control tower at Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him the next morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"It's sad to hear the news", he said.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned the death toll could reach thousands with the disaster relief agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong towns is restricted.
The number is likely to continue to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many bodies have not been reached yet, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) washed away Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Bodies are being brought here by ambulances every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People steal from the little supermarkets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already catastrophic, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the movement and transportation.
Are you ready? CNN said.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
Air Niugini now says one man missing after plane crashes in lagoons
The airline that was flying the plane that sank in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew managed to get off the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a single man traveling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local authorities helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The United States Air and Space Administration has said the plane crashed into the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had gone over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through water to their midway to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew was nervous and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors were working to improve the nearby waterway and had helped rescue people by using a wind boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents in the last two decades but none of these included Air Niugini.
Analyst presents timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented its case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone recordings to create a full picture of the movements of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from multiple cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone during the time he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was at Sanford's party that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my party was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
"He did erase it from your life", said Hale.
The defender will begin his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop tries to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which are political messages and going over social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nani of New York is pursuing a couple for his dismissal following the text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discrimination against her and getting fired after she received a misdirected text message from the mother complaining that she was another black woman.
The couple denied being racist, saying the situation was as if someone was trying to profit.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to see childcare provider Giselle Maurice black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"A very special person", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, rather than sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "disappointed", dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying their old grandmother, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was rather expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice got paid for her day's work and then was sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal, and she is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with the lodging she was hired to do initially, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is a case of discrimination".
The couple have denied the allegations of racism, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried they could not trust her after he was fired.
My wife sent me something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racial.
We're not a racial people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you give your children to someone you've been abusive with, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so.
Comparing the legal case to a situation of someone trying to profit, Plasco said his wife is expecting a baby in two weeks and is in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to pursue someone like that?
That's not a nice thing to do", said the investment banker.
Although the legal case was still ongoing, it took a long time before the public jury convicted the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and their reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear readers would identify with the talking horse, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into someone's shoes when you first read it before it's published.
Now, it's very important to know what we know about Paddington's shocking success.
He said his father, who had been working as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small-town priest, would have accepted it had his work been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the books were published was a "very sad feeling" after his death last year.
He said his father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success in a small silence, describing the prince as a very important member of the family.
He was a fairly quiet man, and was not a very presumptuous man, he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he considers Paddington's success that way.
Although his creation and his imagination were the work, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After she was injured, her daughter was rushed to the Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"She was calling regularly to say things were very bad, and she didn't expect it to come to that", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to keep her heart beating were starting to run out and leave her system.
She had died a little before and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not stop crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave.
Late in the evening Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, was taken on board along with the other passengers - who were unaware of her prophecy.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning post cards to stop suicides on bridges
Two girls who have lost loved ones to suicide, work to stop others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on bridges in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and had an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room.
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I always worry that it will have an impact again later.
Ms. Davis designed the cards, letting people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit in silence - you must speak.
Ms. Humphreys has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad or low or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents he didn't make any eye contact with them or anything like that.
He said that his death had been a great shock to them, but that they had to come to terms: "It's ripping a hole through my family.
He's cutting us to pieces.
But we must all carry on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on sale as the FBI begins investigating
"I was thinking, if we can get something like he asked for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation - maybe we can get some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "failing in the midst of a disorganized legislative body".
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters allow the FBI to investigate?
Their harmony is related to the timing.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senedd, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision on whether to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is falling under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has declined since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South's unified administration, said 1,127 cases of flight last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tighter border control processes between North Korea and China and the higher rates of smuggling of people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most people who flee North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who flee as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forces them back to their own country.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a heated discussion about working towards denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho defied U.S. sanctions over the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disregard ourselves at all", Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "unreasonable", saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "irrelevant", saying that he was unfit, because of the nature of his character, to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her "unreasonable", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both in their teens.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, almost screaming and tearfully tapping at times while discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that the allegations against him "destroy his good name in a consistent and contradictory way" and that they were orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he could not serve on the Supreme Court because his testimony shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows that he was inconsistent with those statements and the way that Clinton supporters hid the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi resigned when asked if she would seek confirmation, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court or to be on the court that he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that she as a Democrat is concerned about possible Kavanaugh cases against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time we had a criminal conviction in court and we were told, 'That's great,'" Pelosi said.
And girls have to talk about it.
It is a righteous speech, months and years of mourning are heaped up, and cannot be removed without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, and she said that she cries when she's angry, but she's developed a technique so that, when she gets angry and starts crying, she'll tell the person she's talking to, "You think my point is that I'm sad because I'm crying?"
I'm a whore.
And then I'll carry her on.
And I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed to give expression to bitterness in part because they are, in essence, misrepresented.
One of the clearest memories I have of my early job, in an office where it was mostly men, and I was crying with hate beyond words, is an older woman in there grabbing me to my grandfather's bed - a cold manager who was always scaring me - and throwing me down the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're a wizard.
They will think that you are sad, and they will be glad that they have hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrawn from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized there was no reason why she should not consider running for the presidency herself.
"I hadn't thought about the decision very carefully", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing he needed was another.
Someone called us the Seven Wicked Wives.
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind her in raising money, so she promised she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
She was a futile battle.
She noticed that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When her campaign announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings got too much for her - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger at the gender bias - and she started crying.
"You'd think my nerves were broken", Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press reacted to her.
You would have thought Kleenex was my physical sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my wine stone?
Did she cry?
How can the US-China trade war be in favor of Beijing
The first waves of the U.S.-China trade war were enough to blind someone, and while the war is not over, a divide between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, taxing, for all intents and purposes, half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has paid the price back time and time again and, most recently, has imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match U.S. efforts and is not the world's only largest economy likely to surrender soon.
Getting Washington to give up means surrendering to the demands, but publicly agreeing to the US would bring too much shame to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can get out of its compass well, the U.S. trade war pressures could support China in a positive way in the longer term by making the two economies less dependent on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger an economic panic in either country or another is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously recognized", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused liaison researcher at the Center for a New American Security, which is the subject of the discussion.
Syria 'ready' for asylum seekers to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept asylum seekers back voluntarily and appeals for help to rebuild the country that has been ravaged by seven years of war.
Welcoming the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure, thanks to the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is working hard to rebuild the areas destroyed by vandals to restore normalcy.
Conditions are now right for asylum seekers returning to the country after fleeing terrorism and the damaging economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure victory as Thomas Bjorn, the Danish captain,'s team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a difficult tournament, but when the USA star ball landed in the water on the par-3 16th hole he had to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian golfer, had led in every round, becoming the first of four players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the strongest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one selector Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England who was most likely playing in his last Ryder Cup.
And playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not one to cry normally, but I can't help it today.
She's had a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for having me and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm glad I was able to help", said Garcia through tears after Europe won.
He passed the baton to fellow countryman John Ram and knocked U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, meaning his record now in the Ryder Cup is 13-21-3.
And that's an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 championships in his career, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had been struggling all weekend to find the clear path.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the boys here, they're fighting hard.
We had put pressure on Europe during the morning.
We did fight.
You must give credit to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
All 12 players played very well.
I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee.
I love 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
You must lift your head to them.
They played better than us".
Red Valley News: Crime has dropped in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in Red Bay deposition for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the WFD, silky areas of loose air appear in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier postings - suggesting that concentrations are decreasing.
The Red Valley's shoreline extends about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee's Point.
There are pockets of it about 10 miles offshore from Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The Red Plain was also seen in Pasco County.
Medium-sized land and sea turbulence in Pinellas County has appeared in the past week, low-to-high sea turbulence from Hillsborough County, unconscious to high turbulence from Manatee County, unconscious to high land and sea turbulence from Sarasota County, unconscious to central Charlotte County, unconscious to high land and sea turbulence from Lee County, and low turbulence from Collier County.
Reports of recurrent pain continue to appear in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
There has been no case of recurrent pain in Northwest Florida over the past week.
