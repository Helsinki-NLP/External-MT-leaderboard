Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about looking like Muppets
There is disagreement among MPs over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This was due to plans to rename the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this may lead to a ridicule.
A Labour Party MP said his group was concerned that the term  could rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means fool and pwp means stool.
A lawmaker from the Pled Party stated that he was not happy with the overall terms and suggested alternative terms.
The Conservative Party of Wales stated that their party was "liberal" about the name change, but stressed that it was a short, unofficial leap from MWP to Muppet.
In this sense, the Welsh letter w is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The House Committee, which is currently preparing a bill on name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what members of the House refer to is naturally a matter of importance to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had broad support for the renaming of the parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
As for the MP title, the commission wanted the Welsh MPs title, but the MWP option had broad public consultation support.
Members of the House of Representatives seem to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus is a headache for Speaker Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit the bill within weeks.
The law on amendments includes other changes to the way the House works, including provisions on the disqualification of members of the House and the design of the committee system.
Members of the House will vote on the title of the bill when it is debated.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was planned after decades of attempts to resolve the conflict with neighboring Greece, which has a separate province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
President of Macedonia, Giorgi Ivanov, opposed the name change referendum, stating that he did not intend to vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayou, argue that the name change is only a cost of EU and NATO membership.
With the efforts of churches in Harlem, the bells of St. Martin's are silenced.
"Historically, the older men I spoke to say there was a pub and a church around every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there are none".
He said the disappearance of pubs is understandable.
He stated that these days "people are socializing in different ways".
"Hotels are no longer the side-by-side living rooms that people regularly go to".
Regarding churches, he worries that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will go back to where they started".
He added that churches would be replaced by residential buildings with shared apartments, so that people who do not support the remains of churches would live in them.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so the day will come when all these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white church pioneers before Harlem became a predominantly black city - the metropolitan community of St. Martin's a decade later - in 1870.
The original white Methodist Church was abandoned by the white settlers in the 1930s.
A black man was sitting near the house where they worshiped and they named him.
ST. Martin was deposed by a black processional led by Rev. John Harvard Johnson, who led a retailers' strike on 125th Street, the main street of retailers in Harlem, opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but the local church of Johnson Sr. decided to rebuild the building using carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called Carillon the "Poor People's Bell".
Scholars who coined the term Carillon in July called it "cultural aristocracy" and "a historical instrument without peer".
Tiffany Angie, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first degree carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether stated that S. T. Martin would not replace him.
What has played out at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex narrative of architects and contractors, some of whom were introduced by non-clerical leaders of the church and others by the bishopric.
The church's board  the governing body of the church, which consists of non-priestly leaders  wrote to the church's board in July with concerns that the church "would be pursuing it to expand along the coasts", even though the board did not have a role in the leases and contracts the church sent them.
Some church members complained of a lack of transparency in the church's territory.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California while diving for lobster.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving at a lobster farm in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamill told KSWB in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when they suddenly heard a baby crying for help, and they rushed to him with a group of divers to pull him out of the water.
Hamill stated that at first she thought it was just a thrill to catch a lobster, but then she "realized the baby was screaming, 'I'm a prey!
I was a target!"
"The whole nest was open", said the pregnant woman, "and suddenly she realized that she had a baby.
And I called to all the people, and said, There is a shark in the water. And the midwife said, There is a shark in the water.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and placed on the critical list.
The nature of the attacking shark was unknown.
The Gryffindor rescue captain, Larry Gillis, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but did not appear to be a dangerous species of shark.
Gillis added that the victim survived the wounds sustained in the upper torso.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Isenitas for 48 hours for investigations and security purposes.
Gillis said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's decides to put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by creating in-store cosmetics aisles that are driven by expert colleagues.
As part of a push to expand the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is growing amid falling sales of cosmetics and home goods, the cosmetics aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Investments in cosmetics are being made in a context where supermarkets are looking to use the empty space in front of the storefronts that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics volume for the first time with an offering of 3,000 products including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also take up a lot of space alongside similarly branded sections in stores like Boots.
Supermarkets are also reactivating the small store-line design so that most products for vegetarians are  convenient  items increasingly in demand by newcomers.
In addition, fragrance retailer fragrance is testing the licenses at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, while the second will open in Seeley Ack, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to daily purchases of small amounts of food from local stores means that supermarkets must make more effort to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like government stores as supermarket chains try to compete against discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl by offering more service and no food.
Sainsbury's is placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which it says have increased retailer sales and made the business more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to modernize its cosmetics and spice divisions ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint speculative deal with Boots in early 2000, but their partnership ended after a dispute over how to divide the capital from the chemicals stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Seansbury's sold its 281 spice shops to Silicon, owner of the Lloyds spice chain, for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of facial hygiene cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CCO of SisenseBoris, said: "We have changed our vision and feel for cosmetics corridors to make the environment better for our customers.
We also invested in our specialised interns who are available to provide advice.
Our brand line is designed to fit all needs and attractive environments, and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination for cosmetics that challenge the old ways of selling".
Peter Jones "shocked" after Halle Willoughby exited the £11 million deal
Peter Janssen star Dragos Dunn is "disappointed" after TV producer Hallie Willoughby exited an £11 million deal to focus on the home appliances brand's deal with Marks, Spencer and TVI.
Willowboy doesn't have time to trolley clothing and home furnishings.
The business of the two partners was similar to the company's Goop Gwinnett Paltrow brand.
This morning, the 37th District announced on Instagram that it was leaving.
Halle Willoughby has angered Dragos Dunn star Peter Johns by exiting the business of the lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and TV I.
Sources say that when the TV star admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her head office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new deal  worth £1.5 million  meant she didn't have enough time to pass the clothing and home furnishings brand to Trollys, Jones was "disappointed".
The similarly branded business of the company Gop Gwyneth Paltrow has doubled Willowby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willowboy 37 announced his departure from Trollley on Instagram, Janes quickly left the UK for a holiday to one of his homes.
A source said: "So far, trolleys have been one of Holly's top priorities.
This probably set a long-term future for him that would be expected in the coming decades.
His decision to leave has made everyone who dealt with him completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on the third day, it was about to start.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlowe's main office that are ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's spin-off, which is among the most lucrative startups in the UK, has had a potential impact on the company's potential to lose millions due to its massive investment in products ranging from mattresses and candles to homewear and clothing.
And it can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willow, a mother of three, and her husband Don Baldwin had a ten-year relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willowbay co-founded the company Trolley with Cap, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March.
The couple went on vacations together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin Television Productions.
Willoughby is set to represent the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host on I'm a Celebrity... on TV.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his import".
"And then we fell in love" tension talk
He joked about criticism from the news media for his views that some might consider "inappropriate to the presidency" and his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump indulge so much?
Trump jokingly said the voice was "news-maker".
"I have left nothing behind".
He said Kim expressed interest in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization.
But denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yang-ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a "reciprocal response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said the United States would continue sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump expressed optimism in his speech.
He said, "We're doing very well with North Korea".
"If we were at war with North Korea.
Millions were killed.
We have these great relationships now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and allowing the remainder of the American crew to return home.
He defended his unusual approach to talks related to Kim's relationship.
"It's very simple to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this enclosed square outside, we're going to put about 200 people in there", Trump said, referring directly to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesian island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok being displaced, a national crisis situation that requires accelerated international assistance has not been declared.
"Unfortunately, in most cases they have been very clear that they do not need international assistance, which is a bit of a challenge", Ms. Sambang said.
While the Child Protection Institute is organizing a team to travel to Palo, it is uncertain whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the National Crisis Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palau to consider allowing international agencies to cooperate in relief efforts.
Given the frequent earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, unfortunately, the country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they do not have a common field of view across the coastline.
Although there was an alarm, the apparent absence of an alarm in Palo likely caused casualties.
At the best times, travel between Indonesia and some of its islands can be challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A mobile hospital on a ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Province Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made the reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, spending the funds on roads and railways.
But budget deficits have hampered Mr. Joko's administration, even though he is running for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian strife in Indonesia, where the majority Muslims follow the traditional Torah reading.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in clashes between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets using bayonets, arrows and other light weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge scores the first leg draw against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Storage saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Zidran Shakri with 0-1 to his team when he was almost 30 yards behind Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting the goal.
With this rush, the ball was thrown at a higher altitude above the penalty area and then changed course to the right and up the net.
Finally, the ball landed on top of Kipa Arizabalaga, who was looking for a jump, and then entered the net.
"It was just an attempt to get the ball in that position, and players like Shaq always go as far as possible, so I just tried to take the initiative as much as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant coming and struck with just a call before he thought much about it".
Chelsea scored the first goal 0-1 in halftime after a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the process, the blue-clad forward passed the ball back to Matteo Kvasic before entering the midfield and quickly into the half of Liverpool's field.
The Quaasic took it by the trick and ran towards the middle of the field.
He then threw the ball directly, which caused Hazard to go into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defence and threw the ball into the goal's vertical arrow with a left-footed shot as Alison Baker passed Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 3 pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea will play Videotron on Thursday at 3pm in the UEFA Europa League.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
According to the crisis management office on Sunday morning, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
A large number of people are reported to be trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday, with waves reaching up to 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sotopo Puru Nogoroho said at a press conference.
Palo, a city of 380,000 inhabitants, is a ruined ruin.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was discovered in Breckenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with knife wounds was discovered at 7.55am in Grayson Mews on John Road, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to testify about what they saw or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages and I ask anyone who was near John Road in Breckenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have been caught on camera, to contact us as they may have information that is very important to our investigation.
A police spokesman admitted that the woman whose body was discovered was a Breckenhead resident and was found inside a building.
Some of her friends came to the scene after the winter had begun, asking where she had been this morning.
Police are investigating the incident, according to statements that they are notifying the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was returning to his apartment when police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he saw what had happened, he was silent and mute.
Residents of the building have been told that it will take hours for them to be allowed in.
A police officer was heard talking to a man who was seen in the area as the scene of the incident.
Another woman stood at the scene, weeping.
He would repeat, "This is so horrible".
At 2 pm, two police cars were parked, one inside the seat belt and the other outside.
A number of officers were standing within the security belt and guarding the apartment block.
All persons with information are requested to message @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 111 555 0800 with log 247 dated 30 September.
The Cramwell Tender in Parliament is the latest monument to be targeted in the "history rewriting" riot.
His exile would be a fair punishment in return for the destruction of the Taliban's cultural and religious heritage in Britain by his fanatical and fundamentalist followers.
But the Cramwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the extinction of the statues, it was inevitable that one day the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace might be targeted.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out the destruction of the civil wars of the Finger.
Cromwell's mistake is that he was a victim of his predecessors' actions, like Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent depiction of William Hamlet's Turnneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century views and part of the biography of a character most believe to be worthy of reverence.
"Cramwell was probably seen by many as the defender of Parliament against foreign pressure in the late 19th century, and certainly the king in his time", Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph.
Whether this depiction is fully authentic is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
Importantly, the mid-17th century war shaped the subsequent developments of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique and recognizable figure representing one side of that dispute.
And his works are glorious, and his works are precious, because of God.
A Chinese farmer was attacked and killed by a wild boar.
Based on local media reports, a farmer in southwestern China was attacked and killed by pigs.
The South China Morning News reported on Sunday that the body of the man, identified by the alias "Yan", was found near a tavern in Liopanxiu Market in Guizhou state, bleeding heavily and drowned.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China, a farmer prepares to inject pigs with a vaccine in a pigsty.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his sons from the neighboring state of Greece to sell 15 pigs.
And it came to pass in the morning, when his brother's son went out, that behold, he was dead, and behold, the doors of the barn were open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the barn with a mouth full of blood.
According to reports, the forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig had torn the farmer's man to pieces and killed him.
The Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted the man's cousin, who is nicknamed Wu, as saying that "the cousin's legs were bloodied and torn".
Security camera footage shows Yan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was discovered an hour later.
And the beast that the man slew shall not be his, nor his son's, nor his son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son's son of the son of the son of the son of the son of the
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was trapped further away to prevent the animal from attacking other people while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yan's family and market officials are negotiating a cash compensation in exchange for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, there have been previously reported cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a husband and wife on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer with its tractor until his wife scared the animal to escape.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not generally aggressive but that the taste of blood acts as a "cat".
"They're just for fun.
They're babies, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You must respect them appropriately", he added.
The effects of the storm will cause widespread and heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to the weather forecast, the storm weakened as it moved toward the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will bring torrential rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Saturday, Rosa had winds of 85 mph and was a Category 1 hurricane, 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, a mid-ocean wave will begin to form in the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. It will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest United States on Monday as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm.
Monday will bring 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, over the next few days, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching wave will form extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, devastated streams and possible landslides in deserts.
Extreme tropical humidity causes rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
About 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
It is possible that due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, rapidly worsening conditions may occur along with the flooding.
It is highly discouraged to go out into the desert without caution when there is a risk of tropical rain.
And the valleys shall be turned into a flood by the pouring rain; and the thunder and the storm shall be in the place of the storm.
In the midst of the approaching waves, heavy local rainfall will occur in some areas of the Southern California coast.
Overall, there is a possibility of more than a half-inch of rain, which can cause mudslides and landslides and roads to become gravel.
For it is the first rain of the season in the land.
Late Sunday and early Monday, some tropical rainfall streams begin to approach Arizona before spreading late Monday and Tuesday.
And it shall rain on the third day in the four quarters of the land, and on the fourth day it shall be heavy.
October will see extreme temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to sudden changes in temperature over short periods.
On Sunday, a prominent example of sudden temperature differences will occur across central regions of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will start again and increase.
Most of the central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to see the onset of heat with a range of 80 from the southern plains to the northeastern regions.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above average.
Throughout the first half of October in the eastern United States, our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of higher than average temperatures.
More than 20 million people watched the court session of Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the influential testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and a woman in the Supreme Court who accused him of sexual harassment that apparently occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political impasse continued with the suspension of regular programming on Friday with a sudden last-minute change of situation: a draft agreement was presented by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flick to the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had been making love to him while drunk and attempted to strip off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanagh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
Nielsen reported that it was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculates the average viewership statistics for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Statistics from other networks including PBS, CPEN and the Fox Commercial Network that aired it were not immediately available.
And Nielsen typically has trouble counting people who watch in offices.
This is, if you can imagine, similar to the number of people attending a football final or an academic awards ceremony.
Nielsen stated that Fox News, whose analysts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of the curve with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the court day.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
Interest rates continued to be high after the meeting.
In the Friday episode, Flick was the central character.
After the Republican administration issued a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was targeted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he walked into a Judiciary Committee meeting, and protesters shouted at him.
Heavily influenced by the criticism and live CNN broadcast, he stood for a few minutes and lowered his eyes.
And a woman called out and said, Behold, I am standing right here before thee.
"Do you think he will tell the people the truth?
She was told, "You are a woman of great strength, but most women are not".
Flick said his office issued a statement, adding that he would have more to say at the committee meeting before the round was closed.
Hours later, as the Judiciary Committee voted to raise the voting standard to the Senate majority for Kavanaugh's candidacy, cable and television networks covered it live.
But Flick said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would address the charges against the nominee next week, as the Democratic minority has insisted.
Flick was relatively convinced by the words of his friend Sen. Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Félix made the decision after speaking with Connès and later with a number of other senators.
Flick's election was powerful, as it was clear that Republicans did not have the voting power to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused critics of "playing politics" on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Theresa May, the UK Prime Minister, will be in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018 to attend the Conservative Party Conference.
In another interview on the same cover, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denounced his so-called Brexit quadruple plan, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "very ridiculous".
Wide Sims shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson on suspicion of killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested on second-degree murder charges.
Officials released a video of a fight between Simms and Simpson, and police said that Simms lost his eyelid during the fight.
CBS affiliate WEFB reported that police found the glasses at the scene and admitted that they contained Simpson's DNA.
Police said after questioning Simpson that he confessed to the fatal shooting.
The defense lawyer says that the fine was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Task Force to track down the fugitive, the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the community for their cooperation in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joey Oliva thanked law enforcement for "trying to enforce justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that Wade's death shocked the Gators and the Texans.
"It's not something you always worry about", Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico City.
After the volcano rose from its crater, the National Center for Crisis Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, confirming 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitors multiple tremors and vibrations.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash covering windshields of vehicles in Mexico City, such as the ZochiMilco neighborhood.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Gio has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands took part in a frontline protest against the controversial first anniversary of the Separatist vote.
Riot police threw eggs and colored powder at a group of masked pro-independence protesters, causing a black whirlwind on roads that are usually a tourist attraction.
Later in the day, protesters also clashed with police, causing the police to use batons to prevent clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgotten, not forgiven", which was met with shouts from pro-Spanish coalition "Vive España".
According to local media reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists welcomed, tensions remain high in the region, which believes in independence.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the voting process.
According to statements by Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out on Friday night to prevent the formation of demonstrations in support of the national police.
Protests continued but were forced to take a different path under pressure.
Narcisse Termis, 68, an electrician who participated in the protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped for a successful independence for Catalonia.
He added, "Last year we had the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we are confused".
In December last year, despite managing a fateful and slight success in regional elections, pro-independence Catalan parties are struggling to maintain their resolve to move forward this year, with most of their known leaders either facing voluntary exile or detention pending trial on charges of involvement in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old master who recorded protests in support of police by his phone, said the clashes were being fomented by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more confusing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Janqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections would be the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
London Gate: Several men arrested after car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly collided with a house in London.
The incident was reported on the Crescent Sky at 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Deputy Chief of Staff Bob Blemings stated that the gates and the building itself were destroyed.
Some parts of the car were also hit by a bowstring.
Minga's 0-1 defeat of Rangers was a win for Livingston.
Dolly Minga's first goal kept Livingston in the lead.
Livingston, who had risen to the top, shook it by beating Rangers, the team's second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Doule Minga's shot cemented the distinction as Gary Holt's side took second place with Hibernian.
The side remained without a win-loss record for the title this season and will go into the knockout stage next Sunday with Leeders Hertz eight points behind.
Prior to this, on Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
At the same time, Livingston continues its unbeaten lead in the division to six games under Holt since replacing Kenny Miller last month, who is still on the losing side.
Livingston missed a chance against Blunt Visitor.
Holt's team, with a manager who also caused problems for Rangers, had to progress long before they scored points.
Scott Robinson crossed the hurdles but changed direction during the goal, then Alan Lithgow managed only to manage his effort in a domino after slipping to prevent a head kick by Craig Halkitt during the goal.
The hosts were pleased with the Rangers' performance against them, although they knew they had the ability to catch the team in certain scenes.
This is where the fatal mistake occurred.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston was busy with the opening moves, as Diclan Gallagher and Robinson both tried to unite to give up a slow hit to Minga, who scored from his spot.
At this point, Rangers dominated but the main defence was unassailable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was definitely not worried.
This situation continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos defended to prevent a goal from being scored by Kelly.
Scott Pittman's lead was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow with a wide kick from the direction of play.
The lead continued steadily to Livingston Field, which was defended consistently, although two penalty  claims were denied after Halkitt's claim to replacement player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball  was denied by a nod.
"Extraordinary" by Livingston  Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony MacArthur Square
An extraordinary performance and result for Livingston.
For a man who continued beyond expectations of the pitch's ascending path, these were great.
Little has changed since the return to the top flight, but most of the points have gone to Holt since he came on the pitch due to his motivational approach.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halkett was excellent, managing a very consistent defense while Minga worried Connor Goldson and Joy Worrall during the match.
Although Rangers lacked internal motivation.
They were very good when they were under the tutelage of Gerard, now they don't have those standards.
They missed the final ball  only once left the main wing open  and it was something of a wake-up call for Rangers who found themselves in a safe place.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Kelen
Laughter and fantasy were at the top of the list at the Turkish and German leaders' meeting on Saturday (29 September) during breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's long-term visit to Germany, which aims to rebuild ties between NATO allies.
They had tensions over issues such as human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Kelen to inaugurate a new grand mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish nationals living outside Turkey.
Police prevented the 25,000-strong crowd from entering the mosque due to security concerns, but the vast majority of fans gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The different protests reflected a split in which German Turks greeted the visitor as a hero and the other side called him a tyrant and insulted him.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: Bicyclist killed after colliding with a motorcycle
In London, a cyclist was killed in a crash involving a motorcycle.
The incident occurred at 10:15 BST near the intersection of Westwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver stopped and first aid arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Road, approximately one mile away from the crash site on Saturday.
The city police said that their officers are trying to identify the man and notify his relatives.
The road was blocked and buses were diverted and motorcyclists were directed to stay away from the area.
Long Larin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
The prison administration said that six prison officers were injured in the riot at the men's prison, which is under strict security measures.
The disturbances began around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Tornado special agents entered the scene to quell the riot, which included eight prisoners and a building wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries to their faces at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specialised trainee staff have been deployed to contain the ongoing incident at HMP Long Larin.
The injuries of six staff members were treated.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we strongly state that those responsible for the incident have been referred to the police and will spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Larin has over 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after an attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were asked to quell a violent riot in which employees were attacked by billiard balls.
The daily storm threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas will benefit).
It is rare for a tropical storm to strike Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen as soon as possible next week as the energy of the Rosa Seismic Storm flows southwestward along the desert, causing flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has now issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, with flooding expected to flow into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to move directly toward Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain closing in late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or hurricane status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center forecasts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches and up to 6 inches in remote areas such as the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to see 1 to 2 inches of rain and in remote areas up to 4 inches of rain in total.
And the rain shall be blessed upon the land that is not inundated with the flood, and upon the land that is not inundated with the water.
Although flooding is a very serious concern and because the southeast is already experiencing drought, some of this rainfall will likely be useful.
According to the U.S. Dry Supervisory Authority, only more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least severe drought, which is the second highest category", weather.com reported.
The path of Typhoon Rosa along the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico, ends in a landfall.
On Sunday morning, Rosales was strong with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 mph.
In the Pacific Ocean, the storm is facing cold waters and thus its strength is weakening.
Therefore, the storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico with intensity on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico will pose a serious risk of flooding.
Weather.com reported that "a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches of rain possible".
It will then move northward along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday, then move northward from Arizona to Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main predicted hazards of the storm or its effects are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods, mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountain slopes.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found with injuries at 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior area of Thurris Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he is in "good" condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Officials have asked all those who filmed the incident by phone to testify.
Trump says Kavanaugh has become "a spy and a bully" for the Democratic Party
Trump stated at a rally in Wheeling, South Virginia, that "voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party's brutal and violent tactics".
Trump said Kavanaugh became "disgusted and angry" at the Democratic Party during his candidacy process.
On Thursday, Kavanagh testified before Congress, strongly and emotionally denying accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually harassed him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people saw the talent, the merit and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
Addressing a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most prolific legal minds of our time, a jurist with a valuable record of public service".
The president, while speaking about the importance of the Republican rally in the midterm elections, referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy in the margin.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running for office, I am actually running".
"That's why I fight for the top candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and deterrence".
A senior deputy to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first key trial vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held in the Senate Chamber by Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake, and casualties are rising.
On Saturday, officials said that a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing at least 384 people and destroying scores more.
On Friday, while hundreds of people were gathering at a festival in the city of Palo, a six-meter (18-foot) high wave hit the beach, darkening the air, killing many and destroying everything in its path.
Then there was an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Sotopo Puro Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's National Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB, said at a press conference in Jakarta that "when the tsunami threat began yesterday, people were still busy with their activities along the coast and did not immediately flee and were killed".
"The tsunami was not alone, it took cars, logs, houses and smashed everything on the ground", said Nogruho, adding that the tsunami was moving along the open ocean at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Space images released by the Natural Disasters Agency showed a large number of destroyed buildings and shops, torn and destroyed bridges, and a flooded mosque.
On the Sabbath day, the earthquake continued to shake the coastal city.
The earthquake sequence was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the force released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said the city's geographic location, at the end of a long and narrow bay, has increased the amount of tsunami that has spread.
Nogruho described the destruction as "extensive", stating that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of several victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nogruho said there would be more casualties and damage along the coastline 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palo, an area called Dongala that is closer to the epicenter.
Nogruho stated that communication was "completely paralyzed and information" from Dongala was not available.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people were living there, adding that staff and volunteers were dispatched to the crisis areas.
"This is a tragedy now, but it will be worse than this", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not notifying the tsunami that hit Palo, although officials said the waves arrived within the time the warning was issued.
A non-literal tape posted on social media showed a man's voice being heard from the roof of a building, warning people on the road below with a hiss of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a dam hit the beach, crushing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the tape.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power and communications outages, which made it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities, but rescued people are in dire need of food and other basic necessities, according to military officials.
The airfields in these cities have been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to more than 800
This is very bad.
While World Vision employees arrived safely from Dongola to Palo, where they were busy installing terrapoly tents on their office grounds, they passed devastating scenes along the way, Mr. Duseba said.
And he said, They told me that they saw houses that were in ruins.
This is very bad.
Although relief groups were taking measures to help, some complained that foreign aid staff were prevented from traveling to Palo.
Under Indonesian regulations, equipment financing and staffing from abroad can only be undertaken if a crisis zone is declared a national crisis zone.
This has not happened yet.
"This is still a state-level crisis", said Olia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Yes, this is a national crisis,' we can call for international assistance, but this legal status has not yet been established".
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami passed, friends and relatives of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously able to change the unpleasant lines of the natural disaster story.
On Saturday, a one-year-old boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman with her mother's body, which had been trapped under the rubble for two days, lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national chess team, trained two of the missing chess athletes for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
The other people who were trapped in the hotel, including Mr. Dandini, were his disciples.
"As a chess champion, I carry my emotions once", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how in the hours following the news of the hotel's collapse, he became a staple in the beach-riding champion community, sending numerous messages on WhatsApp to the polo competitors who were attending the beach festival.
However, the result of his messages was only one gray sign instead of a pair of blue signs.
He said, "I think it meant no texting".
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Newport earthen dam during ATM re-deposit.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing an ATM at a earthen dam in Newport.
The motorist at the amusement park was emptying an ATM and preparing to add more money, Det Denise McCarthy wrote in the newspaper.
While he was at work, another person stole "from the back of Brink's employee David" and a cash box he was carrying to deliver.
According to the newspaper, eyewitnesses identified several suspects who were fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Individuals with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 3680-292-859.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name from Raphael to y.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "Officially becoming known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Yee for some time and released his eighth album Manicures in June.
The change came in the wake of her appearance at a live concert Saturday night to promote her new album Yandy.
The show's creator stated that she would be replacing singer Ariana Grande in the show, which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being the acronym for his current stage name, West recently said that the word also had religious significance to him.
Speaking to Big Boi Radio this year about the album title, West Drawell said, "I think 'Y' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you.'"
"Well, I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
I changed from "one" to "one" to "one" to be a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, and everything else we are.
This album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several popular rappers to change his name.
Sin Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced the names of Lou and Lou's brother as his preferred names.
A former West colleague, Jay-Z, also tested a solution for himself with a spacing line and capital letters.
The Mexican government has pledged not to use the military against civilians.
President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed in Tlatelolco Square that "we will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
Military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people as leftist student movements were taking shape across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youths who study by giving them government subsidies and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving youth into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for AI
Kai-Fou Li, an investor and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
This was after various departments of the US government made announcements about AI, although the US as a whole lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to reach the number one position in artificial intelligence inventions by 2030.
"Doubling AI research funding would be a good start, and we expect a big advance in AI given that all other countries are far behind the United States", Lee said.
This week, Lee said in an interview with CNBC that doubling funding would double the chances of the next big achievement in AI in the United States.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, the Silsonian Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sunvision Ventures and has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
He worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s that beat Attila Carnegie, the highest-ranking American player, and later became the CEO of Microsoft Research and head of Google's China office.
Lee praised the former US administration for technological competitions such as the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and sought to hold a new round of it to help identify future concepts.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is pushing away scientific leaders, it's the companies", Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited leading experts from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy also help the United States to strengthen efforts on AI.
"I think the green card should be automatically given to people with a PhD in AI", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation AI development plan.
Li said the China Foundation for Natural Sciences, like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that distribute money to U.S. researchers, funds academic members, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint AI Center to bring together partners from industry and scientific institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee on AI.
And last month, DARPA announced a $2 million investment in an innovative program called AI Next.
In connection with NSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislature, which was seeking to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken action for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve decades-long tensions with Greece that had hampered efforts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbor implies a claim to its territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the European Union.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanovo said he would not vote in the referendum, and the fight against the sanctions has led to speculation as to whether the turnout would meet the criterion of at least 50% for the referendum's credibility.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Do you want membership in NATO and Europe by accepting the deal with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia's bid for EU and NATO membership is also worth the cost, a country that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Oliveira Georgijuska, 79, in Skopje, said: "I came today to vote for the future of the country and the youth of Macedonia so that they can live independently under the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us".
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they accept the outcome of the vote to be definitive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that there were no irregularity reports as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout in this referendum was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Jose Taniewski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardacko prepared a small stage and set up seats in front of a tent set up by the referendum boycotters.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to be a member with a high head, not a door", Kavarducko said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity and honor.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other places like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian solidarity".
Prime Minister Zayo says NATO membership will attract much-needed investment while the unemployment rate is over 20%.
After casting her vote, Zayo said, "I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO".
He said a "no" vote would "decide our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research suggested that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum below the required turnout.
The results of another poll conducted by Telma TV Macedonia showed that 57% of respondents decided to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
To win the referendum, it is necessary that the turnout must be 50 plus one percent of the vote.
The defeat in the referendum marks the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since seizing power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero opened his way to goal for Manchester City from midfield
On Saturday at Manchester United Stadium, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling scored a 0-2 win for Manchester City by rushing from Brighton's defence.
In the 65th minute, Aguero scored the goal easily.
The Argentine goalkeeper caught a pass from midfield at the start of the season.
He competed for Tony between three defenders before he split the open field.
And he went and found himself enclosed in the midst of four green fields.
He ran forward quickly at the corner of the penalty area for Brighton several times before crossing a defender.
He then passed to Sterling from his left.
The England forward made his first penalty inning to return the ball to Aguero, and he hit the goalkeeper Matteo Ryan with his right foot on the right flank of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero is struggling with some of the issues he has in his foot".
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was our luck that he scored a goal in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first points in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero scored inside the field for Brighton.
He passed a beautiful pass along the left wing that passed through the opposing team, to Leroy San.
Sun did a few practice runs with the ball before running towards the goal's vertical arrow.
The Blue Sky forward scored the ball before it slipped out of the area.
At 12:55 on Saturday at the Rhein-Neckar Ground in Senheim, Germany, City will take on the Messerschmitt Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage.
Max Scherzer is going to hit the Rockies.
While the national team was eliminated from the competition in the final game, there was little reason to have to start again.
But Scherer, an ever-competitor, hopes to pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there is still a tiebreaker for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies earned at least one warning card with a 2-5 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to retain the division title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we'll at least be able to create a problem for the final period knowing that Joe is crowded here in Denver and the other team will likely be playing at the highest level of any score I've seen in my year".
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals are yet to announce their opening day opener on Sunday, but reports suggest they preferred to let Scherzer pitch under the same conditions.
Scherzer, who is set to make his 34th start, hit hard on Thursday and will throw normally on Sunday.
In 220 2/3 innings this season, Washington's right-hander is 7-18 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
While speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the President referred in passing to the situation surrounding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"Everything we do is done in the month of Nov.
We are six weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
This is very important and very important.  I am not running for election but I am actually running, which is why I am running for the leading candidates everywhere", he said.
"You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the ugliness and the ugliness.
They don't fear who will be hurt, those who are elected are only for power and control, what they want is power and control, we are not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and deterrence".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, despicable, ugly, and liars".
He was greeted by a cheering audience, referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee while referring to Sen. Diane Feinstein as a Democrat.
"Do you remember the answer?
Have you unsealed the document?
Ah, what.
No, no, I wait for one. That was a speechless speech, a speechless speechless speech.
The Labour Party is no longer a party.
This is intolerable to those who express their views.
When my current activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was very surprising.
After all, I was the last of the Labour MPs in Parliament who was not welcomed because we all expressed our views.
My fellow parliamentarian John Ryan was treated the same way, because he too stood firmly against Judaism.
In my case, my censorship moves were criticized for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, Jeremy disagreed with former leaders on the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and other similar issues.
A notice on Friday for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting stated: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During his eight years as a local Labour Party member of Parliament, the GC Friday night sessions were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this space is not available in most meetings, and the commitment to a "more kind and decent" policy has been forgotten by many and will in fact never return.
It is increasingly apparent that opposing views are not taken up in the Labour Party and that attention is paid to views that are acceptable to the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy took over, as a colleague with people who I had previously thought had similar political views, I was expected to change direction and take a position that I never agreed with  whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly  and it doesn't really matter what I say  my classmates make fiery speeches on social media, demanding de-escalation and rejection of politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not alone in this experience.
In fact, I am happier than other people in my age group because the opinions about me tend to be more political.
I am amazed at the work and determination of my countrymen who are bombarded with sexual and racial abuse every day but never feel ashamed.
One of the most frustrating areas of contemporary politics is how levels of abuse have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called on the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the Knesset and with every "distrust" move or change in the electoral rules, the party will become more and more paralysed.
I've had a lot of counseling in the last two years, asking me to lower my head and not raise my voice so much and just be okay.
But that's not why I entered politics.
Thirty-two years ago, the day I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy, I was inspired to fight for better service to those who needed it most - either as a local councillor or a minister in the government - against the Thatcher regime's disregard for the classroom that was literally crumbling.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was in any way confused about the political positions and the areas of opposition to the current leadership.
To those who started the movement on Friday, I say to everyone that while the country is going through a difficult Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I see no interest in spending my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I am sending is not to Nottingham Moten, but to my clients, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not.

AIR 17-38 Melrose: AIR defeated and unseated
The last two attempts may have changed the outcome somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the amazing and entertaining Tencent Championship match of the day.
They are currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated side in the top ten.
In the end, it was the superior defence that increased the chances that the main wing did it and coach Peter Murchi was entitled to be satisfied.
"We were tested in this game, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christy Milrose said, "The advantage goes back to the Irish, they had a better chance than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt was dismissed by Claymore, with Ayr leading but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rary Huggins, who was sent off by the Warriors, allowing Mirliss to make the numbers and Jason Baggott to take an irreversible effort.
Clime grabbed the ice with his hand, which resulted in a penalty, scoring before halftime, then began a slow attempt to make it 5-17 to the ice at halftime.
However, Milrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort was blocked by Bagot, who reduced Levi to five points.
A long break was then called due to a severe injury to Rowland Knott, who was lying down, and a resumption of the wave of ice passed between the efforts of Stafford McDowall, defended by Clime.
Head captain Blair McPherson's Ayr was given a yellow card, and again Milrose was put on an extra player against an unbeaten effort by Bruce Colvin at the end of a sudden-death attack.
However, the main wing came back, and when Strowman Hutchinson was given a yellow card from the penalty mark due to a goalless curb, McPherson collided with the back of the forward's ice and fell to the ground.
Klim began, while he did almost all of the rest of the start again, after Kelly Roy punched and threw a two-run home run to Gregory Henry on the main side of the fifth attempt after being in the penalty area of David Armstrong.
SteelGame star prepares for new career in restaurant industry
SteelGame star Ford Kieran is expected to return to the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he is the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old, who stars and writes in the hit BBC show Jack Jarvis, was paired with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Both pairs announced that the ninth season would be the show's final episode, showing Kearnan planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official historical lists, he is a director of AdriftTM Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a Scottish source suggested that Kearnan was looking to partner in Glasgow's "booming restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, trapped on land, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors, who were in a ship equipped with chains and ropes, camped at La Paz.
Blue-and-white flags are flown over public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are engraved with the slogan: "The sea is legally ours".
It is a privilege to have it again".
Throughout Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of losing a beach to Chile as a result of a bloody 19th century war still lingers.
These aspirations are likely at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
A Bolivian diplomat, Roberto Calzadilla, said: "Bolivia has a determination, a spirit of unity and perseverance and naturally expects the outcome with a positive outlook.
Most Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, and hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim - after decades of irregular negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia on granting an independent sea route.
Evo Morales, the indigenous and charismatic president of Bolivia, who is in a contentious bid for re-election next year, also rides the pony for Monday's ruling.
He promised in late August that "we are very close to returning to the Pacific".
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and if it does, it will not make much difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant the territory to Chile, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Paz Zarati, an international law expert in Chile, said the ruling by the International Court of Justice, just six months after the recent arguments were heard, showed that the case was "not complicated".
And despite pushing the Bolivian problem forward, the last four years may have turned it back.
Zarati said, "The issue of access to the sea has been pillaged by the current Bolivian government".
Morales' wartime proverb has weakened any remaining goodwill in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on some issues, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions after this ruling.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Villegas, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected claims that the court decision process was unusually fast.
He said Monday would bring with it "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of contradictions and common interests" for Bolivia.
Calzadilla also rejected Morales's claim - still one of Latin America's most influential presidents - that he used the sea issue as a political prop.
He added, "Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean".
"This ruling is an opportunity to show that we must overcome the past".
North Korea says denuclearization will not be achieved as long as it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that his country would never disarm if it could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ray was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the commitments made at the Singapore Summit between rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a stalemate more than three months after Singapore and North Korea's Kim Jong-un were on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy.
Ray says continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will always bring the North to its knees, an "unrealistic dream".
Washington is careful to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first taking the necessary disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest in high-end fashion on their way to the highway near you.
If you want to expand your hat collection or block out the sun completely, don't wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown showcased a line of unusual necklaces in a hallway for their SS19 collection, which was stunning amongst the collections at Paris Fashion Week.
The highly sought-after hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have been spreading their eye-catching creations in the hallways.
A standing ball by Valentino featured an oversized beige hat decorated with a wide, feather-like edge that tilted the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories include ink-decorated watermelons, witch's hat, and even pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of amazing masks, just for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal's lacquer than high fashion costume designs.
One of these creations was a toy breathing tube with a breathing apparatus and play glasses, while another was a cone-shaped ice cream cone.
And if you keep making the big fashion statement - you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that flat, unpaved towers can reach highways near you.
Oversized hats are seen on the heels of the bombshell, a basket hat with a two-foot-wide brim seen on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The cult tag on the back of the hat, which was very useless and was circulated on social media - introduced another great innovation to the hallway - a beach basket box roughly the size of the swimsuit model that covered it.
The burnt orange raffia box, which was cut into pieces with raffia fabrics and covered with a white leather band, was the ball stand in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Leading designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the highway for the coming summer - since the designer has made such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-size accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and in 2018 this continued with another set of outstanding test results, which was only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), they strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, the careers of their choice, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we are witnessing that modern languages continue to be a popular and preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said,<seg id="6"> "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will enter his mind.
Speak to him in his own language, and it shall reach to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the most recent exams of this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest scores among independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received A or above.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students in Mandarin achieved an upper A, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now offered as an elective subject, in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subject line in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Labour and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers give for trying to fill vacancies are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more, language skills are becoming essential in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities expected that require language skills, these skills are very important in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, having a lifelong skill like this is a real advantage in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically outperform a person with multilingual skills.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 English adults, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, and only 15 percent were able to speak French.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for today's children.
Learning several languages, especially languages of developing economies, gives children a better chance of getting a meaningful job.
Within Scotland, the teaching languages will be different for each school.
A number of schools will focus on very modern classical languages, while others will teach languages that are more important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese, on the eve of 2020.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages offered in independent schools with a teaching staff that specializes in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a secondary learning environment in which children are prepared and equipped with the skills they need to succeed and be successful in the future.
In the present day, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages are of vital importance for the future of a country, and therefore language should be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You should do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council for Scotland.
On Sunday, Lee Browne will host the Lakers' first-ever national championship game in San Diego.
The wait is almost over and fans are looking forward to seeing Lee Bourne James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in his first preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website, "It will be more than one and less than 48".
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans to split the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need to prepare for preseason games at this point in my career", he said.
Timing of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to confirm his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7pm Eastern Time.
You can watch the live stream of Trump's West Virginia rally online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to make a speech at this week's hearing against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct by a Senate vote that was expected to be overturned by a week-long FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this passionate gathering is to help Republicans affected by the upcoming November election.
According to Reuters, Trump's campaign office said that the five meetings in the coming week will aim to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives".
A spokesperson for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters that "Control of Congress is so much on his agenda that he will travel to every state he can if necessary on the eve of the campaign season".
According to Metro News of West Virginia, the rally planned for tonight at the Whisbank Square in Wheeling could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media".
Saturday will mark the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, win the election with fewer votes.
Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, "It's not a good sign for the president to come and win the election over Morrissey".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination to fight to keep the hopes alive for Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided seasons, a four-man game on Saturday afternoon may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
Fast-moving swinging is a fairly innovative sporting concept, but players who are really interested in it have never been interested in other competitions like this one.
So where do they say the fast movement is now?
Jordan Spite said as he was preparing for the race day: "They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I guess I'll just push it a little bit".
Europe has the lead, but is four points ahead with twelve games to go.
As Spite says, the Americans feel they have the wind in their sails and they do, and should be very encouraged, at least by Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each had three points out of four.
Spite's advance from goal to the top of the field is a prime example.
As his turn came, the screams of the throaters grew louder, and while he and Thomas were two points short of the two others, they scored four extra points by throwing the ball into the hole.
The other 15-point throw was met with similar shouts, indicating that he believed the American team was not excluded.
Spite said, "You really should aim straight and worry about your race".
Only these players remain at present.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup legend.
The pair are unique but European in their praise, four out of four and can't make any mistakes.
Mullywood were the only pair to not throw more than one shot on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided hitting on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine on Friday morning.
The performance and the way the crowds seemed to be expending their energy motivated the players to win on Sunday, and as the sun set over Lee's Golf National, there were no more powerful players than Fleetwood and Molinari to score potential wins for Europe.
Preferably both were on different pits at the same time.
However, talk of the magnificence of Europe is still premature.
Boba Watson and Webb Simpson finished with Alex Noren, in the effort of Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball champion.
One single and two double blows against a group of nine went into the hole and Spaniard and Swede never climbed it.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of the pit.
Due to the interaction between both partners, the advice they gave and did not give, and the way a strategy can make immediate changes, watching four-ball and four-man players up close is very enjoyable.
Europe has played better as a team so far, gaining a crucial lead to reach the final, but this four-man season also showed that the U.S. team is determined to fight against this number, especially as the Americans themselves were hesitant.
Europe won the Ryder Cup final by a score of 10-6.
Europe advanced to the Ryder Cup final after taking a 6-10 lead over the United States in the fours and fours.
The duo of Tommy Flight and Francesco Molinari were motivated, excited by a win over Tiger Woods to keep their lead at Leigh Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, trying to retain his prize they had lost two years earlier at Hazlin, dominated the American side in the morning four-ball game, taking the series 1-3.
The United States showed more resistance in the four-man period, winning two matches but failing to break the points barrier.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain their prize.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who are both collectively known as "Mollywood", are only the second pair to score four points since starting four races in Ryder's history, after an exciting weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patek Reid in a four-ball game, they were superbly gel-heavy to beat Woods' undefeated rookie and American Bryson DeCambeo with a 4&5 overtime.
Woods, who tied his two-game lead on Saturday, was actually brilliant, but he lost 19 of his 29 games in the four-man and four-man events and seven games in a row.
Justin Day, while resting for the morning foursome, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating 1&2 teammates Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have it all on a pleasant, windy day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who won three major titles, tied the Americans on Saturday with two test points.
They won the four-ball game by 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Jan Poulter, and then came back to defeat Poulter and Rary McElroy by losing the opening two holes and scoring 3&4 in a four-man game.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned to singles from a four-point deficit, although as keeper, Furyk's team only needed a draw to retain the award.
However, after two days in the top two positions, Sunday's cross-attack looks set to be above them.
North Korea says there is "no way" to unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would undermine North Korea's trust in the United States and that North Korea could not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual meeting of the General Assembly's world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"Without any trust in the United States of America, there is no certainty in our national security, and in such a situation, it is by no means possible to unilaterally disarm first".
While Re repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization and taking gradual steps in this area, in return for which North Korea would be rewarded, his remarks were seen as important in the sense that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on denuclearization first", Ray said, "and will increase the pressure level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even protesting the 'declaration of the end of the war.'"
"Realizing that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an unrealistic dream for people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions will increase our distrust".
Ray did not mention any plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting, which the US leader mentioned earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the other side of the denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, the destruction of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this impasse".
However, the tone of Re's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil", President Trump, called Kim a "missile man" for a suicide mission.
At the UN last year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy North Korea", praised Kim for his courage in carrying out denuclearization efforts, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with seriousness and without fail until we see a complete, final and confirmed denuclearization".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in order to prevent Pyongyang from funding its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in June, saying that progress had been made for North Korea in just a few hours, and condemned him for having "similar demands from the criminal gang".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy the missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking included security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will invite all students who sleep more to try to combat the growing culture of studying "during the night" with coffee.
The findings of one university show that students at the world's number one university are often indifferent to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sizler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was motivated to start the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this when I'm a senior?"
She told The Telegraph that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains the importance of how good sleep habits contribute to student academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a video of a lily room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of daily sleep timing.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive symbols, then encourages participants to think about their daily affairs.
"We know that this behavior of students will not change immediately.
Professor Chesler added: "We believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke".
A culture of pride in "killing the night of the living" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students to sleep deprivation have been a growing problem.
He said ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, even causing weight loss, as lack of sleep starves the brain and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sizzler design the course because he had one of his classes with him last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
She said the course opened her eyes and inspired her to pursue a university-level course.
He expressed hope that the next stage would require all postgraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Zisler recommended that students set their alarm to go to bed and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the rhythm of their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal Minga defeated Gerrard players
While a Dalí Mangué hit defeated the disbanded wing Steven Gerrard 0-1 at Livingston, Rangers faced another scary match.
After a 1-4 February victory at ST Johnston, Ibrox were looking to record their first win, but Gary Holt's team only lost Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager to lose to Leaders Hart's eight-point, goalless lead over Ladbrokes.
Minga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' lineup, lacking motivation, was not even.
While Rangers now fall to sixth, Livingston are third with a goal difference, just behind Hibberne.
After an apparent object was thrown from a distance and struck the head of linebacker Callum Spence, he had to undergo treatment, and may have had problems with the Rangers' ambush.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, eliminating former Eyre in the semi-final stage of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi 11 who scored a Hertz last week and he will be pleased with the way he performed well, holding off his opponents as a group in every round.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made more of an effort with the ball in their possession.
They should have scored within two minutes of the first penalty kick being sent by Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder made a lot of effort with a lot of chances.
Keegan Jacobs' strong free kick went to captain Craig Hallett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, returned it only from a good angle behind the penalty area.
Rangers regained their dominance but looked more hopeful than certain in their third-final game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that a penalty should be announced in the courtyard at quarter-time, because he and Steven Lloyd had collided, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian requests.
Rangers only managed to block two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former Ibrox goalkeeper, was hampered by Lasana Cooley's shot from a Oia Azaria attack.
While 34th-minute forward Levi may be against the flow of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just because of their link.
Again, the Rangers could not resist Jacobs' deep strike.
While DeClan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson and held himself back so Minga could simply throw the ball into goal, Scott Arfield showed no reaction.
Gerrard replaced Ryan Kent for a collapse at halftime, and the change had an almost immediate effect as the striker delivered a shot to Morelos but an amazing Kelly hit the ball from his own line to block it.
But Livingston continued to focus on exactly what kind of play the spectators enjoyed, as Lithgow and Hallett threw the ball one after the other over long distances.
Holt's team was able to increase their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stopped to block Jacobs before Lithgow came out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton replaced Rangers with another early penalty claim because he had collided with Jacobs but Thompson again missed.
Germanok: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Germanak: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From its time as a major branch of science, the Geiger counter became an influential and still major cultural phenomenon, as depicted in the 1950 film The Coronado Wars, starring seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
The man said, "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms being turned off by radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's definitely ticking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" the rebel cells.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" and kill cancerous cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the rebel cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can "see" and re-inject a protein common to many cancers.
A trial vaccine in patients with a range of cancers shows promising results.
A woman undergoing treatment with a vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize malignant cells, found that her ovarian cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory to see a common protein of many cancers called HER2, and then reconstructing the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor J. Berzowski, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzowski explained that HER2 "involves the development of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of worker's blood cancer.
Kanye West began to sharply criticize Trump's pro-Trump stance after appearing at a live concert Saturday night wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio following a rousing performance during a Saturday night live concert in which he praised the United States.
He reiterated his support for Trump in a rallying cry against Democrats after performing his third song that night, "Ghost Town", in which he wore the Greatness Hat back to America.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
The Saturday night live concert began with a performance by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Bert Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment allegations made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although not aired, West's video of himself masturbating was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to mock the West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficult moments behind the scenes about his hat.
"They raped me behind the scenes.
"Don't go in there with that hat on", they said.
They have violated me!
Based on the Washington Examiner report, he said: "And then they said I was in a place of drowning".
West continued, "Do you want to see where it sinks?" while saying that he "will raise Superman, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
Variety reported that although his comments led to audiences booing at least twice and cast members appearing embarrassed at a live concert on Saturday night, another person who was there told the publication, "The whole studio went silent".
West was introduced as the late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Shawn McMiller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed as Perrier's bottle.
West expressed support for conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner with a tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for standing up for MOB".
But Karen Hunter, the TV interview host, tweeted that West was simply "completely amazing at how he is as a person".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their" art "), but rather to someone I believe has an idea and is giving it away that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
He added, "We are too".
Prior to the performance, Raphael announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Peddie.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lane and Prince, changed his last name to a symbol and the artist eventually became known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing and kicking in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Balihakamur.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Local Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kate Harrington, star of The Crown and Under the Toxic Manhood, has been heavily criticized.
Kate Harrington is best known for playing the sword lady John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has faced stereotypes of a masculine hero, saying such roles on TV screens mean that young boys often feel they have to be violent to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kate stated that she believes "something went wrong" and asked how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kate, who recently married her co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "absolutely serious" about dealing with the issue.
He said, "I personally feel very seriously what's wrong with masculinity?"
What counsel have we given the men, for the trouble that is in our midst?
Kate believes television is partly responsible for the toxic increase in masculinity due to its masculine characters.
And he said, What is inheritance, and what is gain?
Does what is taught on TV and the streets make young boys feel that they have to be this defining part of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For the young men are clearly wrong.
She also admitted in an interview that after the conclusion of Game of Thrones next summer, she will not be starring in any of its previous and subsequent installments, adding that "Battlefields and Horses" is over.
From November, Kate will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his bag-breaking brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Dea the best thing he's ever done in the game of thrones.
She said, "I met my wife in this show, so that family gave me my future and my life".
Day played Yeager, Kate's favorite lover, as Jon Snow, an Emmy Award winner in the fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, and this is showing signs of changing from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China due to the transmission of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Greek state that the number of people infected with HIV by this method has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people annually.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese lesbian community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most infections are caused by inadequate sexual care in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made a commitment to universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters criticized the leaked information of GOP senators, which was denied by one of her employees, as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Representative Maxine Waters in the United States on Saturday denied claims that the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators was published on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages by one of her employees.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were spread by experts and "extreme right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information includes home addresses and phone numbers of senators such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Irwin Hatch, both from Utah, USA.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unnamed person on Capitol Hill during a Senate court hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came moments after three Senators from Kavanagh were questioned.
Hill said that conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released information from one of Waters' employees.
Waters continued: "This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and safety are at risk as a result of these false and misleading claims - was not responsible in any way for disclosing this information.
This is a baseless claim, and a complete lie.
Waters's comments prompted criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "This denial is born of anger".
"It shows that he doesn't believe he is a member of Congress", she said.
When a person is accused of something he has done, he should not be angry.
They should not be hated.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They should be quiet and quiet".
Fleischer was apparently trying to contrast Water's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is running to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if it's true", he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that his office had "alerted law enforcement authorities and agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, and that they are held legally accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my staff", he continued.
Johnny English strikes again - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spoof spyof
Recognizing the importance of Brexit in any new film is now traditional with a British attitude that seems to be a revival of the Johnny English Funny Comedy Company that began in 2003 with Johnny English and slowly revived again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-comic with a ridiculous imitation of how obviously we are crap be the country's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, wide-eyed, rubber-faced, inadequate, has been licensed to re-create broken things for a second time - his name is a sign more than anything else that he is a great innovator of humor for the English-speaking film landscape.
He was of course a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to glamorous tongue grease, had a little bit of Claudio, the passion and taste of Mr. Bean and a doll that the man helped with a single note as the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He also originally starred in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, based on the traveller and mystery man Atkinson, which caused chaos.
There are one or two beautiful moments in Johnny English's last adventure.
I fell in love with that moment when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit of armor and the blades of the helicopter wheels moving slowly in front of his hat, making a noise.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but the comedy is presented with insufficient force and is strangely unnecessary, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible itself can now confidently incorporate comedy as a material.
The humor feels more targeted to children than adults, and I think Johnny English's distraction tragedies are not as creative and focused as Atkinson's silent film temptations of a middle-aged character.
The ongoing debate is that Great Britain now faces a serious problem.
A cyber-thief has infiltrated the UK's top-secret spy network, exposing the identities of all British agents involved, and has alarmed the officer in charge  with a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing worthwhile for a prime minister who has been a flashy, troubled figure and is now suffering a complete collapse in political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa-like character but there is not much to work with in the script.
His intelligence advisers inform him that if any active spies are exposed, he will have to remove someone from retirement.
And that means that Johnny English, a deranged, himself now works as a school principal in some elite institution, but is giving an unprecedented lesson in how to do a covert operation: some good dirty work here, if English offers a rock academy-style spy school.
English returned to White Hall to provide urgent information and played again with his long-suffering former teammate Bow, Ben Miller.
Baugh is now a married man and has entered service as a submarine commander, a role in Happy Tree and Hockey Hockey, in which Vicky Pepperrin is a bit of a lost cause.
Thus, Batman and Robin are mistakenly reinstated in Her Majesty's Secret Service, and confront Ophelia Boltva, the beautiful face of Ugla Korlenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the spell of charismatic tech billionaires who claim to solve Britain's computer problems: the role of the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Baugh begin their Odyssey poem with tall clown-like climbers: they pose as waitresses and set fire to the French restaurant; they beat themselves and smuggle their luxury sailboat Volta; and English causes chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get inside Volta's house.
Of course, all the stops are meant for the last scene, but as lovely and exciting as it is, there's something about everything on kids' TV.
That's a very mediocre nonsense.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role and actually do justice to this talent?
The Labour Party rejected the proposed plan that would have the British working four days a week and getting paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week - but get paid five days.
According to reports, the party wants employers to pass on the benefits of the AI revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
This allows employees to enjoy three days off on weekends - but still go home with the same pay.
Sources said the idea is in line with the party's economic plan and aims to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times that a review of the policy was expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a dream that is in line with the Party's approach to returning the economy to the benefit of workers as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first party to endorse such an idea, although the Green Party pledged to institute a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election.
However, this ideal is not currently generally accepted by the Labour Party.
"A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not a party issue", said a Labour Party spokesman.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to draw attention to his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take back power from "faceless" and "interested" managers in economic enterprises.
Shadow Chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire shares back, as the Labour government can make "reductions" for perceived breaches.
He also stated that he plans to put workers on company boards and create ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies to workers, who must have an annual dividend of no more than £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanagh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the office's findings could cause any of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pley asked Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy of South Carolina appeared more open than his counterpart.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course".
"I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh when I went to the hearing.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, he said, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, determined, outspoken".
However, Graham's vote appears to be unchanged.
He said, "My mind is full of the Burt Kavanagh case and it would be a dangerous accusation".
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: denied", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those who are called by his name, can not confirm it.
She is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the World Citizens' Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring a highly impressive lineup of performing stars with an equally impressive mission: ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the concert (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about its goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a global citizen 12 years after achieving their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to encourage people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has more than 19 million "actions" from its fans and wants to pursue various goals.
The report says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funding has so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include Nutrition Power, the participation of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to "help children grow to their full potential", and pledged to provide $35 million in Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the state after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
In April 2018, the Food Power Ambassador Tracy Ullman, speaking to the crowd during a live concert in London, said: "With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put social injustice and malnutrition as a page in history".
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 measures to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for a project called "Feeding Power" that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
He responded to a frequently asked question on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Munsey are among some of the actors performing at this year's ceremony in New York, which is hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnsworth and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "sea blockade" to block Russian energy exports  Interior Ministry
US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed that Washington could use its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russia from entering markets including the Middle East, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's conflict in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because of their energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, they also operate in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to combat it.
He said the United States has the capacity to work with our Navy to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, blockade them so that their energy does not reach the market.
Zinki addressed the panelists at a forum hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "100th largest energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's efforts in dealing with Russia and Iran, adding that they are effectively similar.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use leverage and substitute fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "pony of a trickster", adding that its economy relies on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration, by substituting Russia, works on its mission to raise the level of its LNG exports to Europe and provide cheaper options for European consumers.
Thus, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to encourage Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a Russian hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to increase the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a fully economic project.
The Kremlin stresses that Washington's cold stance on the project is only justified for economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after his meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow: "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a leverage tool and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers".
The US intervention has prompted a serious reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German foundation for industry, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to distance itself from European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between Angela Merkel, German Prime Minister, and Vladimir Putin, Russian President: "I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply".
Senator from Massachusetts says Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running in the 2020 presidential election.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Sharwalli Salon in Holyoke, Senator Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
According to Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild the broken government, and that can only be done if leadership is in the hands of women".
"I will consider running for president separately after November 6".
Pressuring President Donald Trump, he said during a meeting at the Sharwal Hall that "the country is heading in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Donald Trump and Britt Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
The poll, which was not released until Thursday, however, showed that a majority of voters do not think Gunn Vereen should run in the 2020 election.
According to a global poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Center for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not participate.
Thirty-two percent supported this sharing.
The poll showed more support for the participation of former governor DeWille Patrick, with the remaining 38% supporting potential participation and 48% opposed.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with their candidacy for the 2020 election included Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision in January.
Sarah Palin mentions leaving Pauline for PTSD at the Donald Trump rally.
Turk Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq before he was killed in September.
She was arrested and convicted on Monday night in a domestic violence incident.
"Despite what my son is going through, what he will go through when he comes back, I understand the families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and the trauma our soldiers come back with", she said.
Paulin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said his son and other veterans "came back a little different but stronger, they came back with the feeling that there was respect for what the soldiers and the air force and every member of the military have given to this country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Walla Walla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and convicted of domestic harassment of a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states, DC support the challenge to the new asylum policy
The State of Delaware and the District of Columbia filed a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy supporting the denial of asylum to those who are victims of crime or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a summary petition Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of a policy challenging refugees.
The full name of the complaint in Grace v. Meetings claims that the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a complaint in August against federal home policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and boys who are members of their gang" harassed her, but US authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as having the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as these countries are plagued by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who had fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
General Carl Racine, of the District of Columbia's Sarnwal, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
According to the summary of the petition to the court, "Federal law requires that all asylum claims based on specific facts and circumstances be adjudicated, and such prohibitions violate this principle".
Lawyers in the brief stressed that the policy of barring immigrants from entering the U.S. economy harmed them, adding that they may be doing business and "providing the necessary wages".
The General Jeffs Surnwall hearing ruled in June that immigration judges should no longer grant asylum to those fleeing family persecution and gang violence.
The meetings during the policy announcement, dated June 11, stated that "asylum is available to those who have left their country for fear of death, on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social or political group".
Asylum has never been a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face in their daily lives.
Rescue efforts in Palo have doubled as the death toll doubles as search efforts for survivors continue.
The situation for the survivors was increasingly dire.
"It's a sad feeling", said Risa Kessma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her fever-stricken young son at an evacuation center in the city of Belo Paulo.
"Every minute an ambulance would bring bodies here.
Drinking water is scarce".
The inhabitants of the city are seen, they turn, they go to their tents, they take their spoils out of the water, they save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties from the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Du Harris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were lying outside the Palo military hospital, where patients were being treated for severe and persistent aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he thought about the tremor that shook the hotel's fifth floor apartment where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"It was not the time to save our lives.
Harris told The Associated Press, "I was crushed among the ruins of the walls, I think", adding that her family had gone to the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then I heard the silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of "mocking" by "advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US newspaper to promote mutually beneficial US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a Chinese newspaper that paid supplementary fees to the state's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the US election signaled what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of Washington's intensified campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has seen tariffs on each other's imports rise.
Chinese and American experts said China's retaliatory tariffs were designed early in the war to target exporters in states like Lhasa, which is backed by Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Bernstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of China, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now doubling down on these ridicule by launching propaganda ads in our free media".
Branstad wrote, "In expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the American tradition of free speech and our free media by publishing ads in the Des Moines Register".
"In contrast, in the low-key newsroom here in Beijing, you will see limited dissenting voices and not see what a true reflection of the various views Chinese people may have about the path to economic involvement is, except that the media is controlled by the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers avoided publishing his article", though he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans will alienate female voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kuan Yew scandal.
While many Republicans defend the Supreme Court nominee's position against a host of sexual harassment allegations, analysts have warned that they will face a serious backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Sentiment levels were extremely high, with many Republicans on the list indicating they wanted to go ahead with the vote.
Grant Richter, a law professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Law, said in an article that appeared on Saturday, "There can be no retreat on this kind of issue".
Richter said he doubted Senator Jeff Felix's last-minute attempt to argue that the FBI investigation was enough to calm voter turmoil.
According to the Washington, DC newspaper, Crane Jean-Pierry, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November".
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they passed the Senate aisle as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee that elected to advance Cuano's candidacy, while, according to Mace, Dr. Christine Beasley Ford also testified.
"Democratic interest will be outside the box", Stowe Rodenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say he has already reached the heights, it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among urban women voters and young voters, 18-29 years old who don't like the president, usually don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony on the details of sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that reactions might flow if Republicans tried to endorse him.
"This has caused a major breakdown for the GOP", said former chair of the Republican National Committee Michelle Steele earlier this week, according to NBC News.
Guy Sensill, president of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the News Channel: "It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh gets the seat, it's about the way Republicans have handled and dealt with him".
However, Americans seem to have somewhat of a bias toward Ford and his testimony against Kavanaugh, with little inclination toward Kavanaugh.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents either believed Ford's testimony, or probably did, while 35% said they either did or happily believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of Fed said they thought Quanna may or may not have lied during the trial, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flick's efforts, the FBI has now launched its own investigation into the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had molested her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals while they were at a party during their studies at Yale in 1980.
Global Internet Explorer plans to launch a new Internet to catch up with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is taking his first steps to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech genius, Inrupt, is the company that develops the open source platform SolidBurn.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that her goal behind Inrupt was "rule the world".
"We have to do this now", he said of his first steps.
"This is a historic moment".
The widget uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online information store" or POD.
The store includes to-do lists, to-do lists, genres, music, library and other personal and professional items.
This is in the form of Gool Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Silk and Spotify, all in one browser and accessible at the same time.
What is unique about an online personal information store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
The company called it "personal empowerment through information".
The theory behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to pool the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform provided by IBM, a number of contract employees assigned to work on the project, and a volunteer coders committee.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized widgets, using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "are not talking about whether Facebook and Google will make a big change, where other business models were created in the blink of an eye".
"We do not ask permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help integrate and enhance the quality of the new web created in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee shaped the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the dissent discussions.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vaughan: Victorian WW1 Crusade Clergy celebrated
The recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I, the only Church of England priest to have been honoured as a hero, has been in his home town for over 100 years.
Second Colonel, the Honorable Bernard Vaughan, claimed the award on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Billings and Lehighcourt.
However, he was killed four days later by an archer, and he did not know that he had taken the greatest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two daughters-in-law on Saturday at a show in Roshine, Northumberlandshire.
One of his contemporaries, Michel Van, said it was "brilliantly symbolic in shape" and that the stone should have been displayed exactly 100 years ago, on the day his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Journal, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van II crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin with his regiment "in a thick dust cloud and under heavy artillery fire".
He then went to the line of fire and advanced the line with "great courage" before taking the weapon in one hand and hitting three sides.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michelle Van, 72, said her grandparents' performance was "something I could never do, but it's humbling".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughan also presented a bouquet of flowers after the performance, led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Band.
Michelle Vaughn said she was "very proud of the emotions that came out of this performance", adding that "the courage of a true hero is shown, with the support of a lot of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Belator 206, but instead they saw Pippa Pig.
Imagine that you waited all night to see Bellator 206, only to be prevented from seeing the main program.
The St. Eves' Bill featured 13 fights, including 6 fights in the main card, which was to be broadcast all night on Channel 5 UK.
At 6am, as Gigard Mausasi and Rory McDonald prepared to face off, UK viewers were shocked when the live broadcast turned into a pig-fight.
And there were some that were watching, and it was not good for them; and they stayed up all night until the morning, to see the battle.
One Twitter user called the live-streaming adaptation of the children's cartoon "a nasty joke".
When asked about the move, Dave Schwartz, Deputy Chief Inspector of Communications at Bellator, said: "It's a government policy that the content is not suitable for 6am, so they have to broadcast children's programming".
""Pippa the Pig", yes".
Scott Coker, CEO of the company, said they will work on time-sharing to keep UK viewers with them in the future.
"I think when I think about the answer, I think we might solve it", Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday, and we can't solve this problem until Sunday, Monday, at their time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when this change came about, I saw a lot of messages going up and down, and not all of them were very friendly.
We tried to solve this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that this problem will not happen in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of campaigns from six to five - as is usual - and we tried to show more campaigns to the interested parties, so the number of campaigns increased.
This is a regrettable situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'disillusioned' with gender
Olympic rower Tom Daley says he grew up feeling humiliated in front of everyone because of his gender - but this encouraged him to take credit for it.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
In a talk on Radio 4 Desert Island hosted by Lauren Livorney, she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a father made him think less about winning an Olympic medal.
Christy Young, the long-time daily anchor, took a few months off due to illness.
While Laverne appeared alone in the first episode, Daly said that he felt "less than others" growing up because "it was not acceptable in society to love both boys and girls".
"To this day", she said, "it's the feeling of being less than others and feeling different from the real things that have given me the strength to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove she was "something" so that everyone would not be disappointed until they knew about her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic medalist has been a major LGBT advocate and used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge other countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
She said she spoke about it because she felt happy to live without divisions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daly married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than her but she said the age difference was never a problem.
She spoke of her first Olympics when she was 14 and her father died three years later, of cancer - "when you have a lot of problems at a young age", she said, "it was hard for her to find someone whose experiences in the ups and downs of life were similar to her experiences".
The couple had a son, Robert Roy Black-Deley, in June, and Deley said that "his whole outlook" had changed.
He said, "If you had asked me last year, all I would have said is maybe win the gold medal".
"You know, there are bigger things in life than gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby".
His son shares the same name as his father, who died at age 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father could not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked him was to buy his tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to get on the first train.
He said, "I couldn't tell him that you wouldn't live until you got on the first train, Dad".
"I held his hand tightly as he breathed and kept doing it, and when he stopped breathing, I finally knew he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was something I had dreamed of all my life", she said, "and that there was no better feeling than diving in front of people at the Olympics".
This fact was also the inspiration for her first song - a boast about the small stick of a jerub - which was playing with her in preparation for the Olympics and still growing hair on her body.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on Sunday, 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of style on Saturday, sitting in the Reader's Cup chair.
American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his style to avoid an unimpressive result.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for his four doubles on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of attention, as he usually has for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments spent half his days as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game, hoping that it would help him.
A never-before-seen driver, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was never a good choice for the tough Lee National Golf Course, where long-term violence pays a daily price.
And of course, the course itself isn't as terrible, as Mickelson enters his ninth match on Sunday, facing the British Open champion exactly, Francisco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win four races this week.
If the Americans, at the start of 12 singles, come in four points short and make a warm start, Mickelson's race could prove to be a real emergency.
Ferik expressed confidence in her husband, not so much as saying anything.
Ferki said, "He knew his role perfectly today and put his hand on my shoulder and took his arm off my neck and said, 'He will be ready tomorrow.'
"She has a lot of confidence in herself.
He is famous and has been a huge disappointment to these teams in the past and this week.
I may not have imagined him playing the game of chess.
I expected more from him, but this is what happened and this is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there like everyone else".
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played on Sunday.
This may be the end of his career at the Reader's Cup, which has never been equalled by his highest individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven semi-finals, although Ferrick said his presence has brought a load of intangible achievements to the team.
"He is witty, he is sarcastic and funny, he likes to joke with people, and he is a great guy to have on the team", she explained.
"I think the young players have had a good time going up there, which is interesting to see.
He has given more than just to play".
Thomas Beuys, captain of Europe, knows that great leadership could soon disappear.
Thomas Bejorn, European captain, knows from experience that a moderate lead towards the final day of individual competition in the Ryder Cup can easily lead to a dismal run.
Dean made his debut in 1997 in Vladivostok, where he was captained by one-sided Steve Bastyros, who scored a five-point lead over the Americans but won the final line by the narrowest of margins, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remember we were in the top tier at Valderrama; we were in the top tier at Brooklyn where we lost and we won at Valderrama, that's all", said Bjorn when photographed after the 2018 Class 3-5 win on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a 6-10 trip to Lee Golf National.
So history showed me and everyone on this team that it's not over yet.
You will be born again tomorrow.
Go, and do what is right there.
And it shall not be finished until you have passed the mark.
We have one goal and that is to try to win this prize and that is what we should focus on.
I always say, I'm focused on the 12 players who play for us, but we still know who's standing in front of us - the best players in the world".
While he was pleased that his players played hard on the golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm never ahead of myself on this.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow is a solo show that's cool and something different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're alone, you're tested for your full potential as a golfer.
This is the message that you should share with your players, show your best tomorrow.
And now let your companion go, and let him also go and show his goodness.
In contrast to Jordan, Jim Ferrick, the number-one contender, would ask his players to shine better individually than when playing with a partner, expecting more from Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferki himself worked hard at the end of the last two days with a big change, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before suffering a loss as Europe withdrew from the "Miracle in Medina".
Asked how the captain of Ben Crenshaw relied on his players in 1999 to get to the final day, he said: "I remember every damn word of it".
"We have 12 important races tomorrow, but the human wants to go to the same fast start, as you saw in Brooklyn, or as you saw in Medina.
When the stage goes one way, there is a lot of pressure on the intermediate competitors.
We're going to set up our lineup the way we want, we're going to put the players the way we want, you know, we're trying to do a little bit of magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the mixed martial arts and will face Rory McLaury in the higher races, and Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pollar in the semi-high races.
"I chose this group of men in this way because I think it covers the entire course", said Jorn of the selections for the singles tournaments.
The German battleship was once again delayed.
Local media reported that the German Navy's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the cold war-era warship, but the ship will not enter service until next year due to system problems and snowball consumption.
According to the newspaper Dai Zeit, the start of operations of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the new Baden-Württemberg-class supertanker, has been postponed to the second half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after the transfer have caused the future of the large project to change.
The four-ship Baden-Wittenberg-class ships were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen-class ships.
It is expected that they will display powerful cannon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as a number of stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signals.
Other important facilities include long maintenance periods - this should be possible to send the newest ships away from inland ports, for two-year missions.
Dai Zeit notes that, though, it is said that the sustained delays meant that the battleships that would have allowed Germany to design its own foreign missions would have expired by the time they entered service.
The failed F125 was in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the ship and handed it over to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it was transferred.
There is not enough information on the reasons for the withdrawal of the ship, but German media have pointed to a number of "software and hardware problems" that made it useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiency was particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be led by a 120-man crew - only half the manpower that operated on the previous Bremen warship.
Furthermore, it turned out that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is seen in transit, weighing twice as much as the similar ship used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from inadequate hardware, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - was also problematic.
It is said to be priced at €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - €2.2 billion more than expected.
The problems in the latest warship are particularly important in light of recent threats to the shrinking German Navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was facing "few ships that have the capacity to go on a mission".
The official said the problem has grown over time as older ships have been decommissioned but no new ships have been assigned to replace them.
He explained that none of the battleships of the Baden-Württemberg class were capable of joining the Navy.
The National Trust has listened to the mysterious life of bats
New research has been launched at a centre in the Scottish Highlands to explore how bats use landscapes to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of rare flying mammals and help to re-establish the way to communicative activities of these creatures.
The research, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano pipistrelles, as well as the brown foot and ear bats and the Dobbinton bats in the Inverie Gardens in Worcester.
Special recorders will be moved to key locations in the park to record activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also try to launch mobile surveys using handheld fingerprint detection.
An expert audio analysis of all recorded sounds will determine the frequencies of the bats' conversations and which type is doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be created to illustrate their behaviour in landscape scale detail.
Rob Dewar, a nature dialogue consultant for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands and how to preserve forests for bats and other species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk due to building and development activities that cause habitat loss for them.
Northern turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can toxic paper and a number of other chemicals used in home construction, and attacks by houseflies.
Bats are not originally blind.
Although they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful in the sense of smell than their eyes.
They use complex habitat techniques to repel insects and other obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat population seriously.
The foundation has trained 10 cashiers who regularly conduct surveys, night inspections and sometimes rescue missions.
The Foundation has even created the first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Triff Building in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
Building manager David Thompson says this is the place for their idea.
He said, "Here in Tripoli, we have created the best area for bats".
"We've considered old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
But there are many things about bats that have not been discovered yet, so what we are doing here and at other foundations will help us to understand what they do to be successful".
He emphasizes the importance of finding bats before building buildings, as unintentional damage to a single nest can kill up to 400 female and juvenile bats and possibly their entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing or disturbing them or destroying their nest is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's officer for the Bat Conservation Fund, has encouraged people to help.
"We still have a long way to go to learn about bats", he said, "and for so many species of bats, we don't even know that their populations are fighting for life.
Ronaldo denies sexual assault allegations as lawyers prepare to file a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the sexual assault allegations against him "fake news" and said people "want to use his name to promote themselves".
His lawyers are prepared to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal forward and Juventus were accused of sexually assaulting an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Deer Spiegel reported on Friday that he was accused of paying the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
While speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram live after the allegation was reported, Ronaldo, 33, reacted to the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a joke.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera.
"They want to use my name to preach to themselves.
This is normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well", the player added with a smile on his face.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they describe as "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christine Sirtz said the player "is seeking moral damages in response to a serious violation that may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayurga reportedly went to the player's room, where he raped her from behind.
Miorga claims that Ronaldo knelt before him after the incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good man" and told him to leave the other "one percent" aside.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted to having sex with the woman, but this was done with mutual consent.
Miorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her wounds taken in the hospital with her, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman says she has now rejected the agreement because she was traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was due to leave Manchester United to join Real Madrid at the time of the sexual harassment allegations, and in the summer of that year, he joined Giants for €100 million.
Brexit may be 'always regrettable' for UK carmakers
Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said that if Britain loses its position as the world leader in car production after Brexit, it will "regret it forever".
He added that it was "a matter of concern" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its Burnton plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays during a no-deal Brexit could bring mandatory costs.
The Bernaston plant - which produces Toyota Aris and Owens - produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to other Arab countries.
"My view is that the UK will leave the EU by the end of March and we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Burnton.
Other UK manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW says they will close their own small factory in Oxford for the month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what motor manufacturers say will be supply chain risks during a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is "very timely", with parts for cars ordered from other suppliers in the UK and EU being delivered within 37 days.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal by 29 March, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry says could cause delays and shortages of spare parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to wait for days longer than its inventory costs at its plant in Derbyshire, and that production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need a contract. We want the best deal so that we can, as we say, not only be a source of service for now but also take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The demand from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully sustain our supply chain successfully".
Toyota could not say for how long it would stop production, but warned in the long run that the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and, as a result, fewer job opportunities.
Peter Swallows, who has worked at the Bernaston factory for 24 years and is the union organizer at the factory, said union members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these job opportunities are lost, they will not come back.
"We have a detailed and credible plan for our future relations with the EU", a government spokesman said.
White House says Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that Trump's high-level meetings with Vice President Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" once again as disputes over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continue.
Rosenstein is responsible for overseeing the work of the Robert Mueller Special Counsel, which evaluates Russian interference in the election, Trump-Russia aid relations, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump would fire Deputy Louis Sarnoff, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a source of controversy in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein's wearing of Mike to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of Rosenstein removing the president through the 25th Amendment were discussed.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was postponed to Thursday due to the president's participation in the UN summit in New York.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford said Trump said he "would not prefer" to have Rosenstein fired, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of abusing her both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh, which also postponed the Senate vote.
Trump's media secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein, he said: "The date is not yet set, it could be this week, I can see that given all the things going on in the Supreme Court, the meeting could be postponed for another week.
But we do and always like to keep the media informed".
Some reporters may disagree with the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the information was not in the television reporters' taste, and said it "attracted attention".
He then said that direct media contact with Trump would increase.
"The president holds more question and answer sessions than any previous president", he said, without providing evidence. "We looked at the statistics".
Information will be provided, but "if the media gets a chance to raise their questions about the United Nations directly with the president, it would be better than talking to me", Sanders said.
We will try to do that, and you have seen us do that over the past few weeks, and the session where you can talk to the president about the UN will be a press conference".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with other officials.
Individual press conferences are rare.
During the week in New York, the president showed why by taking a media-style and sometimes inappropriate appearance to reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's legitimacy and wish for a post-Brexit Brexit.
Jane Freeman sent a letter to the MSP less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to paying the costs of relocation status applications for EU citizens working in the public sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in the letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the EU's exit were underway and are moving towards an expected decision in the fall.
However, the UK government remains prepared for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this may be a difficult time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to tell you how much each employee's contribution, regardless of their identity, is important to me.
Collaborators from across the EU and beyond have brought us valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved health services and benefited patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is a very special home and we would love you to stay here".
Christine Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head wound
Mike O'Regan, representing Tennessee, said Tennis State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 27-31 loss to the Winderbeat Commodores on Sunday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the Giants that he was injured shortly after the half.
"He went to the side line and fell there", Reed said.
Teachers and medical staff on the sidelines gave him oxygen before putting him on a ventilator and transferring him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "more details about the type/size of the scar are not available", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Ambercrombie, a redshirt sophomore after transferring from Illinois, is heading to his first season at Tennessee State.
He had a total of five fights on Saturday before leaving, bringing his season total to 18.
When foreign buyers buy a building in the UK, they are liable to pay more tax.
Under the new Tory plan, when foreign buyers buy a building in the UK, they will be required to pay more taxes and extra money to help homeless people.
This would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
Increased tax expenditure will impose a tariff burden on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to £120 million a year - to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged more tax-free costs when they buy property in England - plus additional money to help homeless people.
This will serve as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract younger voters with promises of affordable housing while targeting high-income earners.
Tax breaks in the form of tariffs on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK will be imposed with an additional bridge, which will increase the government's ability to deal with homeless people.
Additional costs - which, in addition to the current tax bracket, include the high levels of costs that were included two years ago for second homes and permits to buy - can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury is expected to increase to £120 million in one year.
Estimates of 13th century new London buildings have been imposed by non-resident residents in London, which has led to higher prices and made it challenging for first-time home buyers to step foot on the first floor.
Many of the country's affluent areas - especially in the city centre - have become "ghost towns" due to foreign buyers, who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in tax breaks to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by raising land prices, saying they were not even using it, and asked Ms. to cancel the affordable housing quotas to solve the "residential housing deficit".
Mr. Corbyn has proposed a series of residential housing reforms, including control of rents and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
And he said, Let us give them the power to build houses to dwell in.
She said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the British dream, which is that life should be better for each of the new generations.
And that means building a broken residential housing market.
Brittany will always be open to those who want to live, work and rebuild their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that this is easier for those who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to be as hardworking as the UK.
The dream of owning a home is far from being a reality for many people, and the stigma of homelessness is also a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "last ambition" is to manage Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot, third in League One, just three points behind the top-seeded club, enjoyed the challenge of reviving the Nord-Est.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season after their defeat at Rennes.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won the B Cup and that's it", he told BBC Sports Sound Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child with my father, and that's what always drew me back.
This opportunity will only come when, though, I win the club's management".
The current managers of Sunderland are Ashmel Nic Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poit and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alva Atlantic says he feels he is not afraid to pursue such names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by the scale of 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in the club, it is definitely relevant to the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I might just find myself here if I take the club back with them".
Ross has been in administration for three years after working as a vice president at Dumbarton and only 15 months at coach Gary Hertz.
He then helped Alva avoid relegation to the third tier and the following season, he led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the championship title.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his playing days at Slade, Hartlepool, Fall Creek, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled taking responsibility for the Elves, "It was probably a real fourteen",
"I really believed that the office was more for my comfort than the game.
It's strange because I did well, and I built a good life for myself and enjoyed a number of high positions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to endure week after week.
I still suffer from worries and work stress, but I feel like I'm doing the right thing.
I always wanted to have a clerical job, and now that I'm doing it, I feel like I've been more comfortable in my adult life than ever".

The survey reveals that the best time to drink is 5.30pm on Saturdays.
The summer heat wave has increased the level of visits to pubs in the Brittany area but has put additional pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the data, pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July - but visits to restaurants fell to 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who complained about the figures, said: "The sustained sunshine and England's unpredictable long-term strokes at the World Cup made the July model similar to last June, with pubs seeing a 2.8% increase except for restaurants, which suffered heavy losses.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant business during June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and liquor stores have had their strongest ever performances, outperforming restaurants whose business has declined.
Food bars were also affected by the sun's presence, although not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink alcohol.
Alcohol sales in all pubs and bars managed for the month, rose to 6.6 percent and in restaurants fell to three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social and sporting events are among the major factors in sales in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales year-on-year is especially painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have been any worse for the food service providers, and time will tell if we can experience the much-needed rest in August with lower temperatures".
The overall sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including those that have recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the list of brands.
The Coffees Screw Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a volume of £9 billion, an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have created secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Over 20,000 middle school students appeared on the "Jali-Ansta" pages.
This news has raised fears about the sexual content being portrayed.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" math to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have created social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts - Instagram, a photo-sharing platform.
This news has raised concerns about posting sexual content.
Nearly one-hundredth of students said they were operating through their "real" accounts to show their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that the teenager was asking others to "rape me".
The study, commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Head of Teachers Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two accounts and half of these people do not keep their accounts private.
HMC CEO Mike Bechnen said: "It is reassuring that so many teenagers have been lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.

Elled Doyle was elected to the Atlantic Scotland Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Authority.
Doyle, one of the most accomplished track and field athletes and president of the BET, called the move a great opportunity to mentor others in the sport who can benefit from his extensive experience internationally.
"Elid Hale is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the international athletic community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him on stage", said Beatty.
"I am interested in acting as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute to Scottish sport and help in the mentoring department", Doyle said.
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is currently a BBC pundit who was unable to walk after suffering a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I was unable to walk.
Doctors said that only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was painful, but I recovered, and I learned how to walk, and now I can do agility drills.
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump ad that likened mothers to cows split online opinion into two.
A breast pump company has split online comments on the ad that mothers breastfeed their daughters with cows they feed into two parts.
To unveil what is said to be the "first wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Gann, LLC has released an interesting music video inspired by the ad, which shows the freedom that the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance among a herd of cows to a song that reads: "Yes, I know myself, but you don't see my tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these are mammals, these are my breasts.
The song goes on: "Pump it, pump it, honey, I'll feed it, pump it, pump it, I'll fuck my women".
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying the announcement sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"To advertise this production, using cows was a bad decision.
One wrote, "They need to conceive and give birth to babies like us to produce milk, except for their babies, who are taken away from them days after they are born",
A breast pump is installed inside the nursing chest strap (IV/maternity)
Another person commented: "It's understandably damaging to both mother and child.
But yes, why not use it to announce a breast pump to mothers who should be raising their own babies?"
Another added: "What an emotionally distant announcement".
Others have defended the announcement, with one woman even admitting that the song was "ridiculous".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were still ten years old, I would have bought one for myself.
Pumping made me feel like a real cow.
This is a bit of a crazy statement, but I deduced it for what it is.
One wrote, "This is a great product",
Another person commented: "This is an interesting ad aimed at women who pump (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not a message to judge the dairy industry or to praise it.
At the end of the video, the group of women are shown dancing with a pump installed on their bras.
The main concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that a large number of women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
Although the IV pump is completely off, it has no cable or tube and moves inside the nursing bra, giving the woman the freedom to go wherever she wants, take her babies with her, and even go out when they are being pumped.
Anna Blair, partner and ECD at Mother, writes: "The Alloy pump is a revolutionary product that deserves such a bold and provocative opening.
By creating an equality between female speakers and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and all the challenges involved, while also illustrating this in an interesting way, by providing the feeling of freedom that comes with using the pump.
This is not the first time that Pumpelwy has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two was seen showing off the product wearing a Martha Jacoboski.
Hundreds of migrant children were moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence.
The number of detained migrant children has increased despite the consistent nature of border crossings, as the harsh tone and policies of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to transfer children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants who are afraid of risking their lives in the country by sponsoring a child.
The threats intensified in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and adult family members would have to register their fingerprints and share this information with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albinus, the senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was summoned before Congress after the agency arrested a large number of individuals who had applied to sponsor homeless children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of these individuals, either sponsors or family members of sponsors, live illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to pursue these individuals", Albinus said.
According to Shetler's staff, authorities who want to bring children into the process earlier have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous 60-day standard.
Many people appeared in court via video call to present their legal status application to the immigration judge instead of physically.
And as for the remnant of you that are not numbered, they shall return to their own land.
According to shelter workers and reports that have circulated from the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more anxious or depressed they become, leading to violent thoughts or attempts to escape.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are broader in larger foundations like Turnillo, where trying children are often overlooked, presumably because of their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city, without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to their friends, can be a shock to them, which many of these children already face.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish occupation forces to leave immediately
In his statement to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'lem called on Syrian refugees to return to their country, even though the war is in its eighth year.
Mahomed, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally present on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated as such".
And he said to the assembly, Let these men go out without a word.
The teacher stressed that "the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would "continue to fight this holy war until we have cleansed our territory of terrorist groups and illegal foreign entities".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily tasked with advising and training Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
About 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
On the issue of migrants, the teacher said the situation is better for their return and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading fear" to encourage migrants to leave.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian aid foundations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They politicize issues that should be entirely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction assistance to Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition at the end of the war.
UN diplomats say recent agreements between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel group in Idlib provide an opportunity for negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented widespread harassment by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which is home to millions of people.
However, Mahomed stressed that the agreement had "clear targets" and said he hoped to target military operations against jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, to "root them out".
UN envoy Stephane de Mistura hopes to start the first meetings of the new committee, which will be composed of government and cabinet members, to prepare the post-war law for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The teacher presented the conditions for government participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "passage of current legislation" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the second round
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberal commentators hope, impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency before the end of the term.
What is certain is that "this will be one of the most brilliant endings of the presidency!"
However, there are no signs of viewer fatigue so far.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled from 1.05 million on CNN and 1.6 million, or three times, on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Madoff Show" has taken the top spot on big news nights with cable ratings of 3.5 million.
Neil Baer, creator of the ABC drama "Determined Survivor", about a cabinet minister who is appointed president after an attack on the center, said, "This is a fire where people burn because it's not what we understand".
Neil Squire, former comedy writer and author of Only Funny Parts: The Facts About Going to the Hollywood Kids Club, has another theory.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston, prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Ms. Squill said.
There is a fun value to this mess.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, headlines from outside Washington can shape the future of the WWE, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Adjustment is a privilege that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you find yourself in a six o'clock panel discussion of experts talking about Bob Woodward using "Behind the Dark Background" in Wish's book "Fear", or about a $15,000 ostrich skin jumper (as The Washington Post called "a thick piece with hibernation") and the results of Daniel Sturmi's deceptive comments about Mr. Trump, I'm talking about his anonymity.
I, alone, would never see Super Mario look the same.
"Part of what he does and what it feels like to watch a live show is that he feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, president of Will House Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, which is a spin-off of the Trump show and has a new complication every day (he's at war with the NFL every day, praising Kim Jong-un).
You don't want to lose a single piece or be left behind.
When I visited Mr. Felis this week, during a sunny 80 degree day outside his home in the North Ridge Mountains, he was sitting inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not help but notice that Britt Kavanaugh was not going to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and that the future of the Supreme Court was at stake on this scale.
Mr. Felis told me, "I remember when we were running these crazy programs back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was a form of joke, but as it stands today, they were expressing reality".

Out of the flood of money in tightest home race midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that included two candidates running for a seat.
The rewrite of Pittsburgh suburb Pitts was made by Carner Lamp on behalf of the Democrats - who last spring won a seat in a special election in another district.
Lamb is running against fellow Republican candidate Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th District.
The plans were rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been illegally merged in favor of the Republicans.
Stream 17 has led to a funding campaign between the Big Guns, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb came into existence as a household name after a small victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was widely observed.
The seat had been held by Republicans for a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small share.
The United States imposed sanctions on El Salvador to pressure the country to support China, which later withdrew.
Diplomats said that with some pressure from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had a close meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama, which was later fired by the Trump Foundation management team.
Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to repatriate the heads of US diplomatic missions based in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent dispute over Taiwan's non-recognition".
But the sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including support for drug control, development and the economy.
The proposed punishment, which includes cutting off financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, may have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As domestic meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a previous year's meeting on the same issues, as a step in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted to hold a conference to conclude sanctions considerations on El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is expected to make a statement on the agency's small import ban at a conference in mid-October.
Three US political representatives returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no harsh messages from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the discussion that was sparked by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to remain anonymous, who were prepared to discuss internal talks.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst, who has close ties to the agency and also agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.
Study of history
The next boot to be thrown could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, which already has significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also starting his own investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was in league with Russia to attack our election.
If Congress changes its position, Mr. Trump will find himself held accountable for his willingness to stand before voters and perhaps a jury.
This raises a number of reasons, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump - or his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
Here are choices that must be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will affect the principle of how long the effort will take.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the West resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent years of massacre.
This historical process is such that inflation points and the indescribable march of democracy either accelerates or slows.
Americans face a number of such inflationary factors.
What will we do if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been burning in hot water since the newspaper reported last year that he said he secretly recorded President Trump's voice and fueled rumors that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times's claims are false.
"How will we react to the proposed new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh if it is unfair - or if he is confirmed as chief justice despite the heinous accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?"
And after all, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these experiments, democracy will suffer a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was expelled from Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had once occupied my consular home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the candles on a Sunday on a table with a broken Nazi cross on it.
With such an inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna match
Thursday's hosts Rapid Vienna, knowing about the Austrians' win after a draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Graham Doran from appearing earlier in the season, leading to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use these results as a springboard to better things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal is a good side", the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing we could win something and came back with a score.
We could have turned the game around at the end, but overall, the result was a fair draw.
I think they were better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Going into Thursday, another European Grand Night awaits.
We hope to get three points from it but this game will be difficult because they have achieved good results in their last game, but with the people behind us, I am sure we can try and get a good result.
Last year was really difficult, with everything that happened with my knee injury and the changes that have appeared at the club, but now there is a feeling factor.
Our group is good and the kids enjoy it, the teaching is good.
We hope we can move forward, put the past season behind us and win.
Women are sleepless for fear of retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a number of people talked about it with their families.
Almost half of those in the nationwide study said they discussed long-term care costs with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want to have a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to start the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business nationwide.
You can start there.
Speak to your wives and children, for you cannot provide for your household if you do not give them what they need.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how care should be provided and those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you suggest a way to pay for the expenses.
Your long-term financing options can include a regular long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash value policy to cover these expenses, or insuring yourself with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Take your papers, and go to the battle.
Get a healthcare proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals adapt to your needs, if you cannot speak.
And take a pledge for your money.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that if you are unable to pay the bills, they are paid.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing a medical emergency and heading to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about her medications and allergies?
Move these details into a plan to be ready.
"It's not just the financiers who matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the spices?
Who will take care of the dog?
This plan is ready".

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said that while the death toll is rising, at least 384 people were killed by an earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday.
While communication facilities have been lost, authorities have been unable to obtain assistance from the Dongola area, a region in North Palo that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
After the Palo disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Some key facts about Palo and Dongola on Sulawesi Island are:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow coastline on the eastern coast of Sulawesi Island with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40,000th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
The Dongola area is located along the northeastern coastline of Sulawesi Island about 300 kilometres (180 mi).
It is a county-level administrative area, with a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are important economic resources in Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal area of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also important in Ha'ir Province but much of it is located in Moruli, just off the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palo and Dongla have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongla.
Another tsunami occurred in Dongla in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic ring and is frequently struck by earthquakes.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in Georgia in recent years are:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatera, struck a tsunami on December 26, affecting 14 countries, killing 226,000 along the Indian Ocean coast and more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of successive earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Newar Island, off the coast of Samarth.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook Pedang, the capital of South Sumatra province, nearby.
More than 1,100 were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake shook the islands of Mintawai off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed many villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the area of Pedi Jaya in Asy'h, destroying homes and creating panic among the people as it made them reminiscent of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lampung, killing 500 people in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Turk Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Pauline was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in a domestic violence report and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when a woman asked her acquaintance to call the police and report the alleged crime, she took the call.
KTUU reported that Palin was held in the Met-Su building prior to the hearing and on a $500 unsecured bond.
The network reported that he appeared in court on Sunday, where he was asked if he accepted the charges, claiming "confidently innocent".
Pauline is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also convicted of a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Pauline has been accused of criminal charges.
In December 2017, she was accused of raping her father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic harassment, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
And his concubine, who was his friend, smote him, and he smote her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the former military group in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PSTD, which he suffered during his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: Voices are being killed
Nearly 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami that did not destroy thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake shook the center of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos that have been shared on social media show moments of the quake.
When the tsunami hit, hundreds of people were gathered at a beach party in the city of Palo.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Cifule Sipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been used for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Sipov, 30, is accused of hiring a truck to carry out a motorcycle pedestrian attack along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan that led to pedestrian and cyclist closures in October.
According to the Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the conviction, prosecutors must prove that Sipov "internationally" killed eight victims and "internationally" inflicted serious injuries.
Both courts may issue the death sentence based on court documents.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of vehicular manslaughter, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in planned crimes cases, and one count of assault and destruction of vehicles.
While prosecutors called the attack "planned and deliberate", they described the manner in which Sipov carried it out as "vicious, brutal and corrupt".
The statement stated that "The death of Habibaalvik Sipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angeliani, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laura Dickat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erleigh, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pignonco",
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York sentenced someone to death.
Defendant Khalid Bernays was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, showed less remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigating officer Gunn that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the criminal complaint, Sipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked to have the ISIS flag flown in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Sipov, said they were "rightly disappointed with the prosecutor's decision".
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting his guilt and imprisoning him for life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the damage to such incidents for all involved", said Patton.
Sipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to sentence him to death.
ToryMP says Nigel Farage should be appointed as head of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilize the people's new' during protests at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the 'heat of European cynicism' - because one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should be appointed as head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Boone, addressing a rally in Birmingham, said that if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister, the UK would have "separated from the EU".
But the challenge Ms May faces in reconciling her deeply divided authorities has been highlighted by the already-remaining Tories who have launched their own anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the war plot from being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
The allies stressed that he would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels, despite the reactions - and pressure from European pessimists and workers - to choose one of the options 'between his package and chaos'.
Mr. Boone told protesters that going out meant going out in Solihull, saying he wanted to 'throw the cheekers away'.
He suggested that Mr. Farag should be appointed as a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were the boss,' she said, 'we might be out here.'
MP Willingbroo added: 'I stand for Brexit, but we have to get rid of the checkers.
While declaring his position against the EU, he said: 'We did not participate in world wars because we were dominated.
We want to have our own law in our own country.
Mr Boone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote. 'The theory that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false.'
The Brexit Tour's Andrea Jenkins also took part in the protests, telling reporters: 'I'll simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers are not popular among the people, the opposition will not vote, this is not common in the party and among our activists who took to the streets and elected us at the first opportunity.
Give ear, I pray thee, and hearken unto us.
He added in a message to the lady: 'Prime Ministers keep their position when they carry out their commitments.'
Farag told protesters that politicians should be made to feel 'warm' if they are to rebel against the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
He said, 'This is about trust between us - our people and our political class.'
'They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are sitting here today to tell them: 'We will not allow you to do this.'
She said during a message to an eager gathering: 'I ask you to make the class of politicians who are on the verge of betraying Brexit feel the heat.
'We will mobilize the people's power of this country that won us Brexit and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-reliant and proud Britain.'
However, reminers continued their demonstration along the Birmingham road ahead of their two-hour protest in City Centre.
A group of activists reacted to the tourism by holding banners during the weekend after the group opened.
Fellow workers of Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the start of the conference because of the party's tactics.
"They are the ones who tell us they can have IT systems including all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borderless, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
'It's a perfect imitation.
There is nothing better than a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren will 'think differently' about running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will 'think differently' about running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a session at the Western Massachusetts Lounge.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran against GOP state representative Jeff Diehl, who is Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign manager, in the November re-election.
He is the focus of speculation that he may stand in the 2020 Trump article.
The event was held on Saturday afternoon in Derry, the 36th meeting of Trump with lawmakers since he took office, using the Ton Hall format.
One participant asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and restore the broken government, and that requires a woman at the leadership level".
An arrest has been made in the LSU shooting and killing of Sims.
Police in Concrete Rogue, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Smyth was arrested on Friday.
The Concrete Rogue Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET on the 20th.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near the South University campus.
Police Chief Murphy J. Powell told 247 Sports on Saturday that Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head.
Wade stepped forward to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and having a gun, and admitted to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Parish Concrete Rogue Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who was drafted out of Concrete Rogue, Sims appeared in 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per contest.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinches world title after team order gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
This became clear from the moment that on Saturday, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton and that the Mercedes team would play a large part of the race.
From the start of the bar, Boutass made a good start, almost escorting Hamilton to the danger zone while defending his position on two turns and allowing Vettel to attack above his teammate.
Whittle Nest went to the goals and left Hamilton to run on a backpack through the barrows, which was bound to happen.
Mercedes then went down the range and appeared behind Wittle, but Hamilton took the lead after several wheel-to-wheel actions that saw the Ferrari driver enter the field with great danger, after a double move to defending the third corner with negligence.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the building and finished seventh at the end of the first lap during his 21st birthday.
He then went on for much of the race, as he concentrated on his tyres to make a quick finish and move into fourth place, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen.
He went on to the pits of the 44th, but he could not speed up the remaining eight pits, because Rickonin was on the fourth.
It's a tough day because Valter did a great job during the whole weekend and was a decent man to let me.
The team did an exceptional job that made us a two seed", Hamilton said.
The tongue was very bad.
President Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting on not disclosing a letter from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who accused her of sexual harassment.
While addressing marchers in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad, dirty and unfair".
He said, "The thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the power, when you see the people are powerful, mean, dirty, and wrong,
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks, they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make a disclosure?
You remember his answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we divulge...No, we did not divulge", he added in the senator's imagination.
A letter in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak from his office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, but I did not reveal his story", Hill reported Feinstein telling the committee.
"He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret as he asked".
But his denial did not seem to be acceptable to the president, which prompted him to speak out during a Saturday night rally. "I'll tell you one thing, that tongue was really bad.
Maybe he didn't do it, but he's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to their advantage.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see their dirt, their filth, they don't think about who they're going to hurt, who they're going to step on to gain power and control", Medtyait reported from the president.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 3-5 Belfast Giants
Patrick Doerr scored two goals against Doni.
The Dundee Stars, who played in the Elite League on Friday, lost to the Belfast Giants, who won 3-5 in Dundee on Saturday's return match.
The Giants scored two goals early in the game, through strikes by Patrick Doerr and Francis Beviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney brought the ball to Doerr before the Giants won.
François Bouchard scored an even score for Doni before Lucas Lundwall's goal ensured Nielsen won.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 1-2 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won the game three games to one.
Dewar's starter came on at 3:35 of the fourth, with the help of Kendall McFall, when Bewler scored the second goal four minutes later, assisted by David Rutherford.
During a slow start, Sullivan re-entered the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt equalised for Coney at 15:16.
When he scored his second goal late in the first period, Doerr ensured that the Giants took the lead during the first period.
The group was re-established and Boward, at 27:37, once again put them in conditioned level by a strong goal.
Connie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Milsen score the first goal in the second-half, and he ensured that the team would also make the fifth halfway through the final.
Team Jaines, who have lost their last four matches, will face Milton Keynes in Friday's match.
The air traffic controller dies but ensures that hundreds of passengers can escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he ensured that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly off the field safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing as a result of the earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
So the strong earthquakes continue to shake the area, and many people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palo.
But despite his teammates fleeing the scene for their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gnauan Egong denied fleeing his duty at the floating control tower at El Jefri Palo Airport.
He remained there to ensure that Batticaloa Air Flight 6321, which was on the airport runway, flew safely.
He jumped off the tower after the idea of a traffic control tower code crashed.
He later died in hospital.
ABC News Australia reported that Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Serraet said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
But unfortunately we lost him this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
"When we heard about it, our hearts broke", he added.
This is despite officials fearing that the death toll could reach thousands, and the country's Disaster Reduction Agency says access to the cities of Dongla, Sigui and Butong is limited.
"The death toll appears to be still rising as many bodies remain under the rubble while many more cannot be processed", said the representative's spokesman, Sotopo Porovo Nogruho.
Waves of up to 6 meters in height left Palo, which had mass burials on Sunday, in ruins.
Military and civilian aircraft are transporting aid and materials.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance is moving the bodies at any moment.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being robbed everywhere".
Jan Gylfend, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will get there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every evacuation task.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was previously hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: New Guinea Airlines says one man is missing after Lagun plane crash
The airline that operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing following earlier statements of safe evacuation of 47 passengers and crew from the sinking aircraft.
New Guinea Airlines said in a press release that they could not find a male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the trace.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and flight crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island airstrip.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital until Saturday and all are in good condition.
What caused the collapse and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed in the lagoon due to a lack of airport band.
A number of witnesses thought he went beyond the airport band.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went too low.
Jennings said, "That's great",
Janis said he and others managed to get into the waist-deep water to the exit gate of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight crew were terrified and screaming, and he took a small head wound from the area.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working nearby to improve the docks and also helped rescue passengers using a windshield before the plane sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Routing Security Network shows that 111 people have died due to crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none of these crashes involved New Guinea Airlines.
Analysts offer a timetable for the night he was burned alive.
Prosecutors concluded the case on Saturday with a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The president was testified as a witness in the Intelligence Analysis Section for many hours.
He provided a timeline for the jury on how he used phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defense attorney Quinton Tillis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers during the night he died.
Clarion Ledger reported that Roulette contradicted his earlier statement that he obtained local information from a number of mobile phones that showed Tallis had dinner with Chambers on the day of his death.
When information showed that his phone was ringing during the time Chambers said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city on the Sabbath.
When asked by prosecutors if Tallis was telling the truth about his claims that he was in Larry Sanford's house that night, Sanford said he was "lying because Larry was in my house in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Thelis said he had known Chambers for two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellez deleted messages, calls and details of Chambers's call from her phone.
Hall said, "He removed Chambers from his life",
He set the day for his final defense on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped to move the trial to the High Court later that day.
Hey Brad: What is hip-hop consciousness?
A hip hop artist tries to challenge negative stereotypes about the genre by enriching his music with a positive message.
Bridey from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its original mission of conveying political messages and fighting social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as Fugis and Common have seen a revival of the art in England through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Have you ever seen a black person?
A New York pediatrician sues a couple for firing her after a "discriminatory" message.
A New York pediatric nurse complains that a couple who discriminated against her were fired after receiving a misleading message from her mother about her complaint that "she was another black person".
The pair rejected the statement as discriminatory and considered it as "forced".
Lindsay Placebo-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when her new caregiver, Gisele Marik, arrived at her first day of work in 2016 as a black person.
Ms. Placebo-Flexman told her husband in a message, "No, another black man",
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent a message to Mrs. Morrick twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her mistake, Placebo-Fexelsman "disappointedly" fired Ms. Morika, saying their previous nanny, an African-American, had performed poorly and that she had been willing to hire a Filipino nurse instead.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home by Uber taxi.
Morris now sues the pair for damages for removing him from office and $350 a day for six months, something he was assigned to do, of course without a contract.
He told Puth on Friday, "I want to show them, look, don't do this", and added, "I know this is discrimination".
The pair reacted to the allegations, saying they were not discriminatory, adding that firing Morris was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him after his bad treatment.
And she sent him a message, but he did not tell her.
He is not discriminating.
We are not discriminatory people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told Skin.
Shall thou give thy son to him with whom thou art in league, though he be guilty of sin?
Your own baby?
Come again".
While likening the situation to "forced", Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby two months ago and he was "in a difficult situation".
"Are you going to go after someone like this?
That's not a good thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the case was ongoing, the court of public opinion moved quickly to announce the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter shows that Paddington publishers were concerned that readers of the song would not be able to communicate with the beer-speaking bear.
The letter states that the band's daughter, Crane Jenkels, was born shortly after the book was accepted. "It is a challenge to step on the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, before it is published.
It is very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's great achievement".
She said her father, who worked as a filmmaker with the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book by a teddy bear, may have thought her book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "a bit of a sweetie" after his death last year.
Paddington, who calls her "a very important member of her family", said her father was quietly proud of her ultimate achievement.
"He was a very quiet man, and not a very energetic person", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to her, the situation was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you were proud of him, even though you had no part in it.
I think he described Paddington's achievement in a way that he did.
Although this was his creativity and personification, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After falling to the ground, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan Laphroz said, "Bendit called afterwards to tell me and that he said that it was not expected of him to do this".
"Then I got a phone call from Ned saying he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tachie, I love you so much, honey.
I am coming to you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication doctors gave him slowed his heart pumping until his system finally stopped.
He had been dead for some time and his system was shutting down.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that it would all be revealed.
I couldn't scream, or scream, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I had to keep my emotions to myself".
Mrs. Ednan-Lapiros, who was overwhelmed by the loss of her daughter, finally sat down with the other passengers - it was obvious what she was going through.
He said, "No one knows".
I bow my head, and my eyes are filled with tears.
It's hard to put into words, but I was on a flight when I felt a lot of compassion for Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
A woman posts a postcard to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries will be leafleting cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Willis Bridge to encourage people to call those numbers for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at 18.
She said, "I don't want any more parents to feel the way I feel every day",
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leadney, said her son was a dedicated cook with a beautiful smile.
"Everyone recognized her for her smile.
They always said her smile lit up every room".
However, he left his duties before he died because he was "in a place of great darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was the first to see his brother take his own life.
"I was constantly worried that a secondary effect was happening", Ms. Davies said.
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't sit quietly - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who was a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He said, "She didn't say she was feeling suffocated or worried or anything".
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her behavior.
She was so upset on Christmas Day - when the kids were opening the gift boxes, she didn't even look them in the eye or anything".
She said her death was a big blow to her family but they had to deal with the situation: "It has created a hole in our family.
He has separated us from each other.
But we have to face this reality and fight it".

Kavanaugh's future is on hold as the FBI begins its own investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something in principle, like what he asked for in a time-limited investigation, limited to scope, we could perhaps build some unity", Mr. Flick said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall apart" during the siege of suspected partisans.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hatred is all about time.
The midterm elections are scheduled to be held in five weeks, and if the Republicans perform poorly on November 6th, as expected, they will be severely hampered in their efforts to elect a man to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report is made?
A vote will begin in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kuan Yew can secure at least 50 percent of the vote in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to draw an equal number of votes to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has 'decreased' under Kim's rule
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has declined since Kim came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-seog, citing information from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said the number of fugitives last year was 1,127, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high smuggling rates for people have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment in public.
South Korea grants citizenship to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many of these people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is relatively easy to cross the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China recognizes fugitives as illegal immigrants, rather than refugees, and usually forces them to return.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met for talks in Pyongyang, focusing on denuclearization.
The statement was issued after the historic June meeting between Donald Trump, the President of the United States, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on mutual terms to advance work toward a nuclear-free Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of not making progress afterwards.
"Without the high confidence of the United States of America, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr. Ray said during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britt Cowan "a sickly eater" and says she is not fit to lead the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a sick man with asthma" and said he was not well suited to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said on Thursday, in reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, "I can't imagine that if a woman did this, they would consider her 'sterile.'"
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During the beginning of the statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes even screamed and coughed when talking about his family and high school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "inappropriate and coordinated assassinations" planned by liberals in their anger over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve as chief justice because his testimony showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think that Koko is out of line by making these kinds of statements and the order in which he addresses the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi paused in response to a question about whether she would be called if Kavanaugh was confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
Pelosi said, "I say this -- if she doesn't tell Congress and the BFI the truth, then she's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but she won't be fit to serve on the court she's currently serving on".
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or V. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions about whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's ruling.
"There is no time for people with anxiety, people with bigotry, to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this great?'"
And women need to work on it.
It's a valid criticism, months and years of anger and she still can't get it out without crying.
Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years, "When we get angry, we cry".
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "One woman helped me a lot who was somewhere in the executive ranks, who said she also cried when she was angry but developed a technique that meant that when she was angry, and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm choking, because I'm crying.
I am the Almighty".
And then he went on like this.
And I thought, "That's great".
Tears are a terrible outpouring because of the overwhelming amount of misunderstanding.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my early assignments in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself confronted with a rage that I could not describe, a woman much older than me grabbed me by the scarf - an angry manager I had always been somewhat afraid of - who pulled me up the stairs.
And he said unto me, Let not thy tears be seen in the sight of men.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're dumb and they'll be happy about it because that's what they were aiming for".
Patricia Schroeder, who later stood in front of Congress to represent Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illicit affair on an outbound businessman named Mankey and was kicked out of the race, Ms. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, finding that there was no reason why she should not run for president.
He told me 30 years later, with a laugh, "That was a bad decision to think".
"At the time, there were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
And he called his name Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Since he joined the campaign later, he was left behind in securing funding and vowed not to get into the business unless he received $2 million in funding.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
He asked, "Do they think I'm getting a discount?"
When she made the statement and announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to those who would support her, frustration with the system that had made obtaining funding to target voters a challenge to the board, and anger at gender discrimination - that suffocated her.
Ms. Skordyer recalled how the media reacted to her, "You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown".
"You may have thought that Clynsex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good one for Beijing.
Experts say the initial excuses for starting a trade war between the US and China were noisy, and while the war is far from over, a rift between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant tightening was the imposition of new tariffs this week on products worth $200 billion (£150 billion), which would affect all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing has retaliated each time with kind words, most recently with tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of US products.
China has committed to reacting to any action by the United States, and it is unlikely that this will have a negative impact on the world's second largest economy anytime soon.
Washington's withdrawal from the action would mean a defeat of demands, but kneeling to the United States in the presence of the world would be a shameful act for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if the war works properly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, by building mutual reliance between the two economies.
Abigail Grace, research associate focusing on new US security for Central Asia, said, "The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that would lead to a collapse in one of these countries could be more dangerous than previously predicted".
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' to return migrants
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of migrants and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Malim said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today", he said, "his situation is more stable and safer, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism".
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary return of migrants who were forced to flee the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million of them are still living in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
El-Malam said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had financed the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA, with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5, at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup match in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the victory crown when the Danish captain, Thomas Jørn, scored 14.5 points, which was needed to defeat the United States.
USA star Phil Michelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, shot three shots in the par-3 water on the 16th, which resulted in the match being awarded to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all formats of the game, becoming one of only four players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by the lowest European player, Denmark's Torbjørn Olsson, 5&4.
John's oldest player, Dustin Johnson, took 2nd place and Ian Poulter of England, who may have been his last Ryder Cup match, took 1st place.
Former eight-time Ryder Cup winner, Spaniard Sergio Grazia was named European all-time winner with 25.5 points in his entire career as a player.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't stop my tears.
This year was very difficult.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy, very happy to win the Cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy to have been able to help", said Greshia, emotional after the European Championship.
He passed the torch to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated United States golfing genius Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"Beating Tiger Woods makes me feel incredibly proud because I grew up watching this man compete", said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all three of his matches in France, while Riard is 13-21-3 in his Red Cup season.
A curious figure conspires against one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team struggled to find ways to break free throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
USA captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
And this morning we have also made a fire in Europe.
We threw it away.
Good for Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All twelve of his players excelled.
We're going to rebuild the group, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee again, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to have served as their captain.
You should tip your hat.
We were ahead of the game".
Red tide and island news: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the concentration of red tide in some areas of the Tampa Bay Area.
According to the FWC, cases of fragmented folds have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting a decrease in concentration.
The island's tidal swells and red tides cover approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee Counties.
The fragments can be seen 10 miles from the coastal reefs of Hillsborough County, but some of the sightings are from the past week.
The tides and currents are also seen in Pescou County.
Average concentrations were reported in Penellas County beaches during the past week, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County beaches, high to low frontal concentrations in Menatee County, high to high frontal concentrations in Sarasota County beaches, medium to high frontal concentrations in Charlotte County, high to low frontal concentrations in Lee County beaches, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Reports of respiratory burns continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manti, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory infections were not reported in Florida during the past week alone.
