France has traditionally used simple technologies to cast its vote: Voters isolate themselves in the polling station, put a pre-printed paper in an envelope, and indicate the candidate they want.
Once the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.

The voters can send representatives to be present in person at each stage of the process. The evening votes are counted by the volunteers under strict control and following special procedures.

Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is thought that this process took much longer due to the breeding that took place between the endemic Darwin's serine, a medium-sized terrestrial serine, and the unrelated cactus serine, Serinus conyrostris.
You can make it any shape. You can spin it into little bubbles.
You can pull it with a thin metal wire that you can twist and weave, you can fold it or you can fold it into a sheet.
You could make it very thin and put it in another metal. You could make it so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, called illuminated manuscripts.
You can use the juice of red cabbage as a marker.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level of a test chemical is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the number of H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons disconnected from each other (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).

Most are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to horns and claws.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) who feed on many more small prey animals, such as insects, reptiles, snails and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of the abdomen, each cat has a special function that keeps it from competing with others.
Lion are the most polygamous cats, living in large groups called pride.
Pryder consists of one to three blood-related adult males, with which there may be more than thirty females and cubs.
The female is usually more closely related to the other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Pride lions are more likely to behave as wolf or dog groups, the animals are surprisingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger, can chew (right, not so well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the owl, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can purr.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but it's more like a phrase of murmuring, screaming words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds when possible.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find their prey by sniffing, sniffing all the places they've been on the ground.
Ocelots are nocturnal, and they can see very well, and they can also move very stealthily. They prey on their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small group of organisms (small caps) are separated from the main cap from which they originated (e.g. if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will always be found in another environment that is different from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics and adaptability than previously required to be a strong competitor.
The native population hasn't changed at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population adapts to their new environment, they become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years later, the two populations will be so different that it's impossible to call them the same species.
we call this process "specificity", which simply means the formation of new species. is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

We build our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat most of our food out of plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosquito was the most important predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosquitoes.
Long jaws had more than 70 teeth, sharp as a razor, with an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that anything that crossed its path could not escape it.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a branched tongue, and its diet included crayfish, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have even been anthropomorphic.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus rex, was nothing to it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans wore strange or unusual animal elements, including wild boar, wild boar, wild boar, and a type of rodent called a sleepyhead.
lts alternative was that while poor men and women would sit on chairs and eat their bread, the rich would like to have banquets where they would sit side by side and eat their food.
The ancient Roman cuisine could not include the food that was imported in the ancient centuries from Europe, America, Asia.
They had no Egyptian noodles, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever ate Indian beans.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the gods.
The people sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, where only the priests can enter.

The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not that important.
The majority of a Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were open-air display boards facing the street.
The land of Canaan lacked forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norwegian legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered it and named it Greenland.

Though each country was Scandinavian, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had many differences in people, kings, customs and history.
If you've seen the movie "Treasures of the Nation", you might think that the treasure map was on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document in italics.

So it's possible that the notation was added as a direct trademark.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting for them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies conquered southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, American and French independent troops had liberated southern France and were shifting their course towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together, the society.
Civilization comes from the Latin wordcivilis, meaning civilization, which is related to the Latin wordcivis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the prototypes of nations.Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural traces, and the equitable sharing of information.

During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first created a weak central government, where, under the terms of the Confederation Treaty, Congress was its only component.

It also had no power to overturn interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and are the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in the International Games and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to as the archipelago, due to the group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
1624 - The Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a reorganization of the local grain cultivation practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.


Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.


For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analog film era.
still being made today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
35 mm is actually a bit confusing, 36 mm wide, 24 mm high.
So the ratio of the sides of this form (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio of the whole number) is, as you say, 3:2.

The much-in-interrupted and often-mocked third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by keeping the order size in mind.
It states that the most effective part of the main theme is the line intersection, which divides the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was in control during this period of European history.
Over a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
The dominance of its universal power affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.

The central structure of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this dogma has been preserved.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective in stopping the supply of vital military and civilian goods, despite the fact that this blockade violated universally accepted international law, which was enshrined in several international agreements adopted over the last two centuries.
UK was digging in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted military action being undertaken by its submarine fleet.
n the 1920s, the dominant approaches of many citizens and nations were the pacifist and isolationist approaches.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of the same.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a warrant from Charles Batchelor, his former employer, addressed to Thomas Edison.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
There was also a period of instability in the provinces between each dynasty. The most prominent of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In this region, there were many warlike feuds between the nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in China's ancient history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest throne in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
nce the revolution,all jobs were open to all male applicants,making it possible for the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of a rank-based army, they're now based on a size-based army.
The French Revolution also inspired many other upper-class working-class figures in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this world. To meditate, he would visit a cave that became known as Hira,Nur (light) on the mountain.
The cave is a vivid representation of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.

actually, it's not that easy to find, even if someone knew it existed. once inside a cave, it was completely isolated.
You can't see anything except the beautiful skies and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing.
The Egyptians built the Great Tower in the 3rd century BC. It's one of many great tower structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Stele or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several towers (the largest of which is the Great Tower), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Tower was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller towers, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family.
The top column looks like a V, and the  the bottom column looks like a square block or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you start at the top and pull the lever, and down means you start at the lever where your hand grabs the lever and pulls the lever.
A high pitched melody usually produces a softer sound, whereas a low pitched melody is more powerful and stable.
You can use a pencil for your own notes, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for musical purposes, so usually you have to consider them.

They returned to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a mob screaming and threatening the Queen and the King.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the window of their chariot.

To understand temples, one must understand the context that helped create the order.
The year in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Early Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which were to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the very notion that human destiny is being driven forward by basic logic, in conjunction with scientific laws and other manifestations of technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two basic ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has effects on specific societies rather than being determined by society.
You could say that a motorized car is bound to lead to road improvements.
trnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
The massive depletion of cars on the roads has also led to a high rate of accidents, which has led to the development of new techniques in the healthcare industry to treat damaged bodies.
Romantism is a major element of cultural determinism, seen in writers such as Goethe, Fichtel and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with this geography were added, the latter being better in harmony with the sphere of society than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As the epicenter of the Renaissance, it became famous around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 BC.

It was around this time that the fashion capital of the world went from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style flourished in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
In the early Middle Ages, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
nce the communication routes were slow,the styles in the West could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the time was the use of knots to fasten clothing, as a result of the Crusader campaigns.
The goal of subsistence farming is to produce enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Ecology is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds that are specifically conserved for the ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, many farmers have been involved in consumer agriculture, and this is still going on in many developing countries.

The qualities that define a particular sub-taste may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often communicate their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashionable, satirical, and abusive terms.
One of the most common ways to show the importance of socialization is to look at a few unfortunate cases of children who, having gone through neglect, misfortune and intentional abuse by adults, have not been socialized by adults as they age.
Angry or Wild Some wild children have been restricted by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases because the abandonment was due to the parent's refusal to severely harm the child mentally or physically.
Before being abandoned or running away, wild children may have been brutally exploited or traumatized.
others are thought to have been raised by animals, some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When a pet is raised by a non-domesticated animal, it exhibits behaviour (in physical terms) that is almost entirely similar to behaviour of particularly wary animals, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Although programming classes should make learning easier and more fun, generating code is a step further.
Code generating is not a learning method, but rather a helping hand, supporting individuals as they undergo a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The stickers can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of the stickers, but so is the person with the little folder in the Microsoft office.
Virtual Boards are integrated into the software and are designed to ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to violence to even bullying.
No child should be raised in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing and educating, and yet there are still those.
We think the adoptive family system is a safety zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Supposedly, the adoptive family should take care of all the needs that haven't been met in the home they've been taken from.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic of the web leads to additional metrics in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord also found that personal engagement and lasting relationships are perspectives for new motivations (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
This video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim that you can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, The President's Beam, points out how people who have speech impairment due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th century studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variation, hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new evolutionary change, and selection removes it from the list of manifested changes.
The dissociation and the reconnection confuse the changes between the two combinations in each generation.
Inside the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human would have difficulty meeting its amino acid requirements with the available plant resources.
n't do this, there are serious consequences: decline in growth, undernutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant sources would be proteins, which are found in leaves and stems, but like us, they're hard for primates to digest unless they're cooked.
Unlike animals, ants, termites, eggs, not only are they easier to digest, but they also provide a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.

Sleep apnea is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.

Alternatives based on biological rhythms include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, the famous urinal) before bedtime, which causes the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the body and the mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can get an education.The only thing that keeps us from getting an education is our own tension and negativity.

Buddhism is very simple, basically, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the imagining of various gods, the energy pathways are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, systematic, procedural, and cultural clashes forced the countries to abandon the agreement.
2 years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years, and replacement, real armies would fight in battles from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Placadar.
Though these plans were thwarted almost overnight when the Soviet Union's Red Army of approximately 800,000 troops entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job was to ensure that your country retained the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the last notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Although the German Navy, which used its submarines, was trying to block the route.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them, to make milk, hair, meat and porridge easily available.
The domestic goats were usually kept in pastures that fed on hillsides or pastures, often followed by herds of goats, usually children or teenagers, as were the more extensive herdsmen. These methods of breeding are still used today.
The railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the carriages were made of only wooden parallel panels, they allowed the horses to pull them in order to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the relatively less flat roads of the day.
The railway poles were introduced early enough to hold the railway rails in place, but it gradually became clear that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron.
This became standard practice, but the iron in the wooden wheels of the wagons caused more wear.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with steel wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron lines were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking, and humans began walking vertically with the introduction of Homo erectus, two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal species have been found in the fossil record from the Australopithecus, 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelianthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

When it was passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to the John Dunlap print shop a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap broadcasts.
On July 8, the document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Lanterns of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving examples of documentation. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.

They have spines and fangs, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
all computers today are based on information processing, which is encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number system can have only one of two values, say 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, if you use computer language.
The symptoms, such as burning, are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal toxicity might be the presence of a drug or an open container of toxic economic chemicals.
Check the label for the first aid instructions for the poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with woodpeckers, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Killer insects and woodpeckers are sedentary, adapted to living in the host's nest or habitat.
United States has about 400,000 diagnosed cases of multiple sclerosis, proving that it is still the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.

The study found that women are twice as likely to have a Master of Science degree as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
On the other hand, the parents who give birth to a child at the time of adoption, give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.

Aristotelis's ideas have been adopted by all fields of science, including psychology.
Griegesexplorations cut the West off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noticed that physiological and behavioral repetition often depends heavily on the presence and creation of endogenous cycles via biological clocks.
Rhythms that are not just responses to external periodic signals have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-supporting oscillators that will continue to spin freely even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is evolutionary material.
Hersh and Chase used phages and infections to transplant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, marking DNA with radioactive phosphorus in the phase or radioactive sulfur in the phase protein.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are embryonic cells.
Only mutations in embryonic cells can pass to babies, whereas other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural places to enjoy the scenery as well as the flora and fauna.

Everyone is part of the community and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone is unhappy with the state of transportation systems.
seldom in the developed world do you hear this level of complaint about water quality or about bridges falling down.
Why are transportation systems so complained about, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers not professional? Or are more basic things being done?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior 100% of the time.
Fortunately, drivers tend to maintain a fairly stable distance, so traffic flow tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help us plan, design and operate our road infrastructure.
The first animals to fly, the bats were able to fly, which made it easier for them to avoid enemies, to find food, and to find mates more efficiently.
Most midges have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.

Content Theories focus on finding what makes people choose or find attractive.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
These theories are about finding out what makes people want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's dual function theory are two well-known theories of content.
Two behaviors can arise when managers start taking over their former peers.One end of the spectrum is trying to stay one of the guys (or girls) in the front row.
This type of leader has difficulty making decisions that are not popular, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, allocating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a creature transforms into a mysterious individual who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and make his own moves.

Virtual teams are held to the same standards for excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which can be unintelligible to their local leadership.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team, where every member reports to the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals of implementing the organization's learning concepts is to innovate.
