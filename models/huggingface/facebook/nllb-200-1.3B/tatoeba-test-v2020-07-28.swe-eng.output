The TV's not working.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
What's it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this stuff.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What was that?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one asked you to agree, but why not at least accept that there are people who have opinions different from yours?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
