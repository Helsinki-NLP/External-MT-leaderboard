This is all because of your carelessness.
I feel the same way.
I'm going shopping with Tim.
Is this a spectacular sight?
How many aquarists have you seen today?
I think you should answer your question.
I was talking.
I just want to see you happy.
How many eggs do you want me to buy?
Tom is so bad.
Tom didn't look where he was going, so he fell into a dock.
These glasses are with you.
What does that mean?

Mary decided to wait until she got home.
Tim was married to a Canadian woman named Mary.
Would you bring me a glass of water?

I want to be as good a singer as I am a cello.
I need a big mailbox.

You've got to have this because you didn't care.
I met that girl.
What do you want from me?
Tom has climbed many countries.
I don't like this site.
Come on, please.
The bus will leave soon.

This is a horror movie.
What time is it now?
Tom seemed very worried.
"Where did you put your chair?" "I left it at school".
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
It's not too late to turn back.
Is it cold outside?
I want to see you laugh.
Tom seemed very unhappy.
I was looking for someone to play chess with me.
I felt the same way.
I think Tom should just stay home with Mary.
Tom likes to cheat on his friends.
I went in for coffee.
I'm upstairs.
I'm upstairs.
I just want to see him happy.
I have one thing to say to those who hate me.
I wish I could play the flute well.
I'm only five minutes late, sir.
Tim is playing outside with his friends.
I wanted to see Tim's smile.
