A Welsh MP who fears shame
Some MPs are confused by the proposal that the title of Member of Parliament (MP) should be changed from AM (Assembly Member) to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The plan to change the name of the Welsh Parliament is the starting point.
Members of all political parties are concerned that this will lead to ridiculous situations.
One Labour MP is concerned that the party is going to be "Twp" and "Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers, Twp means "dirty" in Welsh, and Pwp means "shit".
One MP from the Pride Kamli Party suggested an alternative as the whole party was "dissatisfied".
A Welsh Conservative MP said the name change was "open" but that the party was not too different in pronunciation from the MWP and "muppet".
By the way, the Welsh pronunciation of "w" is similar to the Yorkshire accent English "u".
The committee, which is currently drafting the name change, said: "The final decision on the title of the members of the parliament is, of course, a matter for the members themselves".
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which showed strong support for the change of the name of Parliament from the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the nomination of MPs, the committee supported the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP) proposal, but the MWP proposal received the most support in the citizens' consultation.
The MP is actually proposing an alternative, but the road to agreement could be a headache for Chairwoman Ellen Jones, who is required to submit a bill on the name change within weeks.
The Bill on the reform will also include other reforms to the way Parliament operates, including the rules on the vote of no confidence by Members and the structure of the committee system.
In the process of the Bill's deliberation, the Members of Parliament will have the final say on what they should call themselves.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
A vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" will be held on Sunday.
The referendum was organized to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a region in the country called Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that its northern neighbour's name deserves a claim to Greek territory and has strongly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the country's name, said he intends to ignore the vote results:
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as the churches in Harlem struggle.
"When I talk to old people, I hear that there used to be a bar and a church in every painting", says Adam.
"There is no one now".
I can't believe the bar is gone.
"They're communicating in a different way".
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood living room you go to all the time".
As for the church, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the powerful expect and that "sooner or later we will have to start all over again".
He also says that the church is being replaced by apartments and mansions, and that the people who live there do not help to maintain the church.
"I think most of the people in this building are white", he says, "and this will speed up the closing of the church, because most of them who are moving in will not be able to come into the church".
The church was built by the white congregation. Then Harlem became a black city. In 1870 the Metropolitan community, ten years later St. Martin's, was founded.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation that was praying nearby owned the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of Harlem's 125th Street retailers, hiring and supporting blacks.
The church was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it and commissioned Callion.
Reverend John Howard Johnson and his successor, St. Martin, named the Callion the "Poor Man's Bell".
The musicians who came to play the carillon in July called it a "cultural treasure" and "an incomparable historical instrument".
According to Tiffany Young of the University of Michigan, this is the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysius D. Lind, who had come to the carillon at the riverside church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Mellyweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
What has happened in these months in St. Martin is a complex story of the builders, some of which have been brought by the faithful leaders of the church, others by the diocesan parish.
In July, the parish's governing body of pastors sent a letter to the parish concerned that the parish was "trying to bear the cost". However, the governing body was not involved in hiring architects or contractors.
Some parishioners complained that the bishop's actions were not transparent.
A 13-year-old boy is diving in a California lobster and gets attacked by a shark.
Authorities reported that a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while swimming in the California lobster on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season.
It happened just before 7:00 a.m. at Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to KSWB-TV, Chad Hamel was swimming in the ocean with his friends for an hour and a half on Saturday morning in San Diego when he heard a boy crying for help and went to pick him up.
Hamel, at first, seems to have thought he was just too excited to take the lobster, but soon he realized it was "a scream".
I got bit!"
And Hamel saw that the whole of his bones were rent as he delivered the lad.
"Everyone shouted to get out of the sea. There's a shark!" says Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
We still don't know what kind of shark we attacked.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been confirmed to be present a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to be a dangerous species.
And the boy's upper torso is severely scarred.
For investigation and safety, authorities have blocked the beaches from Pont Beach in Cassabad to Swami Beach in Escinitas for 48 hours.
Giles says there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans are a major step forward for the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's specialists employed Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams as department-style beauty corridors for their staff.
As part of a major push for the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow even as sales of fashion and household goods decline, larger beauty aisles are being tested in 11 beauty stores across the country and, if successful, will be expanded next year.
The investment in beauty was born from the search for ways to make sure that the supermarket uses all the shelf space when it is being sued for TVs, electronics and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the company has announced plans to double the number of beauty products by 3,000, including the first ever Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr.PawPa brands.
Existing products like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be able to take more space in the brand space you see at Boots.
The store is renewing its boutique zone and is turning most of its products to vegan, in response to the demands of young people.
In addition, the perfume company's flagship shop will be split into two Sainsbury's stores: one in Croydon, south London, last week, and another in Cerry Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
With online shopping and the tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local convenience stores, supermarkets have had to work hard to attract customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, as supermarket chains offer more services, reduce food and compete with discount Aldi and Lidl, stores will become more and more department stores.
Sainsbury's has expanded its footprint with hundreds of Argos stores since buying two chains two years ago, which boosted grocery sales and increased the profitability of acquisitions.
Previous attempts to renovate beauty shops and pharmacies have failed.
Sainsbury's had a venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke up over how to distribute the pharmacy's revenue.
A new plan emerged after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was involved in this, introducing skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mill Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, says: "We change the environment for our customers by changing the way they look and feel in the beauty aisle".
They also invest in specially trained colleagues who can give them advice.
Our brands meet all needs, showcasing the new beauty business to old businesses in an attractive environment and convenient location.
Peter Jones is "outraged" that Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal.
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones is "outraged" that Holly Willowbee has pulled out of an £11 million deal with Peter's lifestyle brand business, which focuses on a new deal with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
It is impossible for Willoughby to spend time on household goods and accessories brand Truly.
The two businesses were likened to the group brand of Guinness Paltrow.
This morning, Willowbee announced on Instagram that he was quitting the business.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones at the tail end of their lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on a new, larger deal with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Jones was "outraged" during a tense meeting at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when it was revealed on the Golden Girls programme on Thursday that her new contract worth £1.5million would make it impossible for her to spend time on the household goods and accessories brand Truly.
The business has been compared to the Guinness Paltrow group of brands, doubling Willowbee's estimated fortune of $11 million.
When Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones jumped out of England and headed for one of the villas.
"Truly is Holly's top priority right now", said a source.
The future of the European Union is not a long-term project.
Everyone was shocked by the decision to withdraw.
No one could believe what happened on Thursday, right before the release.
"Marlow's headquarters are full of warehouses full of ready-to-sell goods".
Experts say the departure of Willoughby, Britain's most trusted star, will cost millions, with massive investment in products ranging from cushions to candles to clothing and household goods, and the potential for further delays in launch.
This means the end of a long relationship.
The mother of three, Willowbee and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been courting Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowby launched Cap and Truly in 2016, and Jones joined as president in March.
They're on holiday together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become the face of M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin on ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night that he "will not comment on his business".
And I told him the hard story, and he said, "I fell in love".
He joked at media criticism that his comments were considered "non-public" and that he was too optimistic about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up?
The president said in the voice of a news anchor:
"I'm not giving up anything".
The president said Kim Jong-un was positive about the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by the president as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Hyun-hyun, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday: "We still have not confirmed the 'appropriate response' from the United States to our country's early disarmament".
Instead, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions to pressure the US.
Trump expressed a far more optimistic view in his rally speech:
"We're doing well with North Korea".
"I used to plan to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
"I'm in a great relationship now".
Trump says that efforts to improve relations with North Korea have produced desirable results, including the end of missile tests, the release of innocent hostages, and the conversion of the remains of American soldiers.
And he used a strange metaphor when he talked about his relationship with Kim Jong-un.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of calling 10,000 people outside to cram them into a packed auditorium, I called 200 people who are there now", Trump said, pointing directly to the people in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake hit Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Longboat earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were not needed.
Despite the devastation of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok Island, no national disaster has been declared that is necessary to call for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, we have made it clear that we are not asking for international assistance. This is serious", says Sumbun.
Save the Children is preparing to travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear if foreign staff will be able to operate on the ground.
Spoto, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were considering whether to allow international aid operations based on the situation in Pal.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia is experiencing, the country remains desperately unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, but not much elsewhere along the coast.
Pal clearly has fewer tsunami sirens, whereas sirens can save more lives.
Even at the best of times, it is very risky to go to the Indonesian islands.
Natural disasters have made logistics even more complicated.
The rescue boat that was parked in Lombok to take the victims of the earthquake will leave for the port of Par, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure a focus of his campaign, and is investing in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds and the lack of re-election next year have plagued Mr Joko's government.
President Joko is under pressure from the long-running sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are more conservative.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced. Christian and Muslim gangs are fighting with machetes, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons.
I'd like to recommend Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, who is a deep-lying scooter, the Icosaher vs. Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute of Liverpool's defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stanford Bridge in London.
When Sturridge received a pass from Sheldon Shakiri, he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team was 1-0 down.
He taps the ball to the left and shoots it into the forward.
The ball went far above the goal and fell into the net on the right.
The ball, which was thrown at Kepa Alizbalaga, was a goal.
"Shakes are as fast as they can get in front, so I was just trying to stay in my position to get the ball, and I was just trying to play my game in the time I had", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched him a little, I didn't think too much, I just shot him".
Chelsea, who took the points from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute, led 1-0 at half-time.
The Blues striker blocked the path for Mateo Kovacic in that match, turned around near the midfield and ran towards Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick giv and go in midfield.
Then I let go of the beautiful pass and headed for the goal.
He broke through the defence and hit the fast-pitch net, hitting a shot across Liverpool's Alison Becker with his left foot.
On Wednesday, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, Liverpool played Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm.
Chelsea will play against Videotron in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
The agency's spokesman, Stopo Puro Nugroho, said that the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday had left many people trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building and caused waves as high as 20 feet.
In Pal, a city of 380,000, the ruins of collapsed buildings are scattered.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a woman.
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a criminal investigation is underway.
A 44-year-old man was found stabbed in John Street's Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are calling for information from the community.
Detective Detective Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation has started early, but we are calling for information from the people in Birkenhead, on Margeside.
Especially, I'm listening to the taxi driver because the video that's important to the investigation could be recorded on the dash cam".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in the Birkenhead area, dead inside the house.
In the afternoon, a friend who knew the woman arrived at the scene to be heard about where the woman was found this morning.
Police are in the process of informing the victim's neighbouring home and the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose was told by police officers that he was not allowed to enter or leave the building when he tried to return to his building.
When he realized what had happened, he said nothing.
Now, residents are told that they will be allowed in in a few hours.
I heard the cops say the whole town is being treated like a murder scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
He kept saying, "It's terrible".
At 2 p.m. two patrol cars were in the rope, and another was just outside.
Several officers were inside the rope, watching the building blocks.
If you have any information, please contact DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or call an anonymous climb-stopper at 0800 555 111 and tell them the log 247 for September 30th.
The Cromwell statue in the Houses of Parliament is the latest monument to be "rewritten history".
The expulsion was poetic justice, and it was for the destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts, such as the Taliban, by fanatical Puritans.
Mr. Crick said the Cromwell Society was "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The inclusion of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of the statue".
The symbols of the English Civil War were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps a different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of Thomas, our ancestor in the previous century.
The grand description of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the historical record of a figure many still believe to be worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith tells the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell, in the late 19th century more than today, was a champion of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is a completely correct expression is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of this country, and Cromwell is the recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His service as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
The Killer Pig Morse is killing Chinese farmers.
According to local media, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by pigs.
A man known only by the name of Yuan was found with his artery cut in a six-barrel water market in Wuhu province and bloodstained around his pigsty, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer at a pig farm in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China, was vaccinating pigs.
He said he was traveling with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at a market in the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and found the door to the next pigsty open.
There was a big boar in the hut with a bloody mouth.
According to reports, forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bumpy", said his cousin, who is called "U", according to Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
The body was an hour after death.
The pig that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were being quarantined so that no one would be harmed and that the police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and the market manager are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been previous instances of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in a truck, and his wife got away with it.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by a pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
"I'm just playing.
I'm not a child, I'm not curious, I'm not hunting.
"We have to be honest and be fair", he says.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through the cold waters north of the Gulf of Mexico.
But, Rosa, the floodwaters will continue to sweep northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The winds from Rosa were a Category 1 hurricane at 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, new trawls are forming in the Pacific and moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As the Rose moves into the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical low pressure, it will push tropical humidity northward toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa brought ten inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
And, as tropical humidity and approaching trout interact, widespread heavy rainfall will occur in the southwest over the next few days.
In rural areas, rain of 1 to 4 inches will cause flooding, landslides, landslides, etc.
When tropical humidity is high, rainfall increases by two to three inches per hour, especially in Arizona and parts of southern Nevada.
And we're seeing rainfall of two to four inches in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
The scattered nature of tropical rainfall is likely to cause flooding and the situation to deteriorate rapidly.
Therefore, it is very dangerous to walk in the desert in the rain.
Heavy rains threaten to turn the canyon into a river, and thunder and strong winds may occur in some places, and hail may blow.
The approaching trout will bring local heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
The total rainfall may exceed 0.5 inches, which may cause small landslides and road slips.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
Late Sunday and early Monday, sudden tropical rains are approaching Arizona, with rain expected to spread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to spread across the country on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, temperatures fluctuate rapidly across the United States to lower the Arctic, while the tropics remain fairly warm.
The temperature of the atmosphere may change dramatically over short distances.
There is a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
In Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
The summer heat will intensify again over the next few days.
With temperatures reaching 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast, much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm in October.
On Tuesday, New York is likely to reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that temperatures will often be above average in the eastern United States in early October.
Over 20 million people are listening to Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million watched Thursday on Six television networks the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who claims to have been sexually assaulted in the 1980s, Breezy Ford.
Meanwhile, on Friday's stage, the station suspended its regular programming and continued to receive political support because of a twist in the deal that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had designed to conduct a week-long investigation into the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Cavanaugh was drunk and tried to make fun of her and strip her at a high school party.
Cavanor testified that it never happened.
On Friday, according to Nielsen, it was seen by more than 20.4 million people.
At the time, the company's ratings were the average for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other companies, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Nielsen always has a problem with the people he sees in his office.
That's roughly the same number of people watching a football game or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel has a host who strongly supports Kavanaugh's candidacy, Nielsen said, with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a single day of the hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million subscribers, NBC has 2.94 million subscribers, MSNBC has 2.89 million subscribers, and CNN has 2.52 million subscribers.
The hearing was a hot topic.
Frank was the lead on Friday.
A moderate Republican who made a statement supporting Kavanaugh and voting for him was surrounded by CNN and CBS reporters and shouted by protesters as he tried to get on the elevator for a Justice Committee hearing on Friday morning.
He stood with his eyes closed during the CNN live broadcast of the smear.
"I'm standing before you", said a woman.
"Does it look like he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "Women are powerless, so you have power".
According to Freck, his office issued a statement saying that he should have more to say at the committee hearing before the elevator closes.
In a few hours, when the nomination of Kavanaugh is to be voted on by the entire Senate, all stations will begin broadcasting live.
But, as a handful of Democrats have argued, Frank said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the candidate next week.
Frank was pretty sure it was a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After conversations with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision:
Frank's choice had power, because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans could not vote to appoint Kavanaugh.
President Trump has the FBI investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Mrs May, has condemned criticism of Brexit as "political charade".
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, condemned criticism that her plans to leave the EU were to the detriment of the national interest by "enjoying political games" with the future of the UK.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who appeared on the front page of the newspaper, highlighted his attack on the so-called checkered scheme, saying that the UK and EU are "absolutely fantastic" to collect each other's taxes.
Police have arrested suspect Dayton Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player Wade Simms.
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Simms.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video showing Sims and Simpson fighting, and police noted that Sims lost his glasses on the way.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and CBS' WAFB reported that Simpson's DNA was found in them.
After hearing Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wade and causing fatal injuries.
The compensation was reported to be $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Mobility Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the community for their cooperation in making the arrests.
Joe Aleva, LSU Athletic Director, expressed his appreciation for the "diligence and pursuit of justice" of local law enforcement.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6'6" and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
LSU coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"What I feared is over", says Wade.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern side of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Center warned people to evacuate the volcano on Saturday, and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash from the volcano, which began activity from the crater in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring the tremors.
Images on social media show the windshields of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, being covered in ash.
Geologists have confirmed that volcanic activity has increased in the area 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The Catalan independence movement is in a state of unrest.
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands of people took part in a year-long protest to mark the Catalonian vote to leave the party.
When the masked separatist group pushed the motorcade, they threw eggs and powdered paint, creating a dark cloud of dust in the usual tourist-filled street.
The Scaffolds also used their guards to end the fighting, and they operated with the police during the day.
For several hours, the pro-independence group faced the coalition, which shouted "We will not forget, we will not forgive", "Spain forever".
According to local newspapers, 14 people are being treated for minor injuries from the protests.
Tension is rising in the pro-independence region, a year after the referendum on October 1st, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was blessed by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the votes were low because those who opposed it boycotted it.
According to Catalan authorities, in the area where last year's clashes were intense, police tried to block the election at polling stations, where about 1,000 people were injured.
Pro-independence groups were camping out through the night on Friday to stop the demonstrations, with the support of the national police.
The activities progressed, but were forced to go in a different direction.
Narcisse Thérmes, 68, an electrical engineer who has been involved in separatist activities with his wife, says there is no longer any hope for Catalonia to become independent.
"Last year was a great opportunity.
"I saw my parents crying for the right to vote, but now I'm stuck", he said.
Despite a minor victory in the regional elections held last December, the Catalan Independence Party is struggling to build momentum this year for self-imposed asylum and imprisoned leaders, in the face of a trial over their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent drafting of the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on the phone for the police, said the conflict was being exacerbated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more intense", he says.
Oriol Funcelas, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced on Sunday that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the contempt and repression of democracy that we have received from the Spanish government", he says.
The men who were arrested after a London Berry hit their house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a series of collisions at a Londonbury house.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinagaard Crescent.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
There's also evidence of a crossbow being fired from the car.
With a manga strike, Livingston wins the Rangers 1-0.
The first goal by Dory Menga ensured Livingston's victory.
Ranger was shocked when Livingston gave the club's manager, Stephen Gerrard, a second 18-game defeat.
Gary Holt's side matched the second Hibernian, and it proved that Dory Menga's attack was a difference.
Gerrard's side will be without a win in the Premier League this season and will face eight-point trail leader Hearts next Sunday.
Before that, Thursday, the Rangers will play Rapidwin in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their division undefeated streak to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last week.
Livingston missed an opportunity against a dull visitor.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged the effort towards the goal. Then Alan Lithgow could only direct a wider effort after such a slide to meet Craig Halkett's headline beyond the goal.
The hosts were happy to see the Rangers play.
And that's how the important goal was achieved.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston set up a manga with the opening, DeCrangler and Robinson.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, could not break through the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely interrupted.
Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly, but the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman was denied because of the wide-angle view of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McCleger and Lisgour's feet from another Livingstone set play.
Cross came into Livingston's box and was cleared all the way, but Halkett replaced Glenn Middleton and one of the two penalties for handball was dismissed.
The Livingstone phenomenon is analyzed.
I'm going to tell you about Tony MacCarolina at the BBC Scotland.
Livingston's amazing performance and results.
For men, they were brilliant, and they kept exceeding expectations for this upward trajectory.
Their playing style and staff have changed little since their return to the top flight, but he has since his arrival much credit for the way he has powered the team.
He had many heroes.
While Menga was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in line, Captain Halkett was putting together a wonderfully organized defense.
Ranger, however, was lacking in inspiration.
They were sometimes as good as they were under Gerrard, and they did not quite meet their standards.
Their final ball was missing - they only opened the home side once - and it was like a wake-up call for the Rangers.
We'll have a mixed reception in Cologne.
On Saturday, the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin, and there were smiles and blue skies.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the over 25,000 strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned up nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, also listened to them and condemned Prime Minister Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the disagreement between the visitors, who are welcomed by some German-Turks as heroes, and the visitors, who are criticized by others as dictators.
Deptford Road Crash: A bicycle driver is killed in a car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred at 10:15 am UK time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver stopped and the ambulance man ran after him, but the man died on the spot.
The crash happened a month after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Child Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and report him to relatives.
The road is closed and buses are being diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Six guards were injured in the riot.
Six guards were injured in a riot at the maximum-security men's prison, the guards said.
The riots at HMP Long Latyn in Worcestershire have continued since around 09:30 on Sunday.
Specialist Tornado guards were called in to deal with the disturbances in the wing where the eight prisoners were held.
The officer suffered minor facial injuries and was treated at the scene.
A prison representative said: "Special trained guards have been deployed to deal with the events at HMP Longlartin".
Six staff members were injured.
We will not tolerate violence in prisons, and those who are held accountable will be mentioned by the police and will spend more time in prison".
HMP Longlattin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been attacked by prisoners and was being treated in hospital.
And in October last year, a task force was called to the prison to deal with the serious riot that was caused by the attack on the staff at the billiard ball.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger from the cannon fire of Hurricane Rosa.
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but the risk of gunpowder is highly likely early next week as the residual energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the southwest desert.
The National Weather Service has already issued a cannon water warning for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern and southeastern California, and Utah.
Rosa is expected to approach late Monday with rain and hit Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted: "Since 1950 there have only been 10 tropical cyclones and low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina 1967 was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches and unprecedented rainfall of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocky and Great Basin, may be one to two inches, and rarely up to four inches.
The area is suffering from drought. For those who are not at risk of gunpowder, the rose rain may be a boon.
Flooding is a serious problem, but because the southwest is currently in a drought, some rainfall could be beneficial.
"More than 40 percent of Arizona is in at least extreme drought, the second highest category in the United States", reports the drought monitor at weather.com.
In the beginning, Hurricane Rosa's path crosses the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico until it lands.
Hurricane Rosa had maximum sustained winds of 85 miles on Sunday morning, and is located 385 miles south of Punta Eujania, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is hitting the cold waters of the Pacific, and is therefore losing its strength.
So, it's predicted that the tropical low will hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or night.
There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in various parts of Mexico, and a risk of major flooding.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches and maximum of 10 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora", weather.com reported.
Rosa will cross Mexico north as a tropical storm before moving into the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, and then through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The primary danger to Rosa and its impact is the very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Sonora Northwest and the United States: the Southwest Desert", said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening artillery fire, mudslides in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Four people arrested for attempted murder in the midsummer Norton attack.
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbing wound was found at the age of 16 in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in Radstock, Avon, overnight.
The police are waiting for someone with cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Cabanero is suffering from the demise and anger of the Democrats:
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and vicious policies", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said during his inauguration that Cabanero "suffered from the degradation and anger" of the Democrats:
Cabanero testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied her claim that she sexually assaulted Christine Blazy Ford when they were teenagers decades ago.
She also testified at the hearing on her claims.
The president said on Saturday: "The American people saw the magnificence and character and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
"The vote to approve Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to approve one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a legal professional with an outstanding record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president, while talking about the importance of Republican candidates in the midterm elections, referred to Kavanaugh's recommendation in a distant way:
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't run, but I'm actually running around", he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate chamber on Cabanero's appointment will take place by Friday, the GOP's top aide to the chief executive told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the casualties are rising.
At least 384 people have died and many more have been displaced as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on Pearl Beach on Friday, and at dusk waves of up to 18 feet rushed ashore, killing many and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were doing activities on the beach and they didn't run away immediately so they were killed", said Stopo Pulwo Nugroho, representative of Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, briefly in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami reached the outside world at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Pal:
Aerial photos released by the disaster prevention agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges toppled and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by a secondary quake.
We could feel a series of earthquakes in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have expanded its geographical and tsunami scale.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive", saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nguloho said the casualties and damage were worse in the coastal area called Dongara, 300 km (190 miles) north of Pal, closer to the epicenter.
"There was no information from Dongola at all and communications were completely dysfunctional", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", he said.
Officials said the wave came during a warning order, but on Saturday authorities were widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami hit Pal.
Amateur video shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building, desperately warning people on the ground that a tsunami was coming.
Within minutes, the walls of water hit the shore, and buildings and cars were swept away.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused major power outages and cut communications around Par, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun to transport relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities by cargo transport aircraft, but the displaced still desperately need food and other basic necessities of life.
The city's airport is only reopening for relief efforts, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Pal on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
World Vision staff in Donggala reached Par, where employees were sheltering in waterproof sheets installed in the office yard, safely, but they saw devastated scenery along the way, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Rescue groups have begun to show signs of rescue efforts, but some claim that overseas rescue workers with deep expertise are being blocked from reaching Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas will only be distributed if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster hotspot.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a state-level disaster", said Auria Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'I see, this is a national disaster. We can get international aid, but we're not there yet.'"
On the second night in Par after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family loved ones of those still missing were hoping that the tragic story of the natural disaster was a miracle.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under rubble, with her mother's body by her side for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained the two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in the Loa Lorea Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon, who circulated among the paragliding community in the hours after the news of the Loa Roa Hotel collapse, said he had been desperate to send a WhatsApp message to a competitor of Pall's who was attending the Beach Festival.
His message was marked with a gray checkmark instead of a blue check mark.
"I think that means the message didn't get through", he said.
A thief in Newport, Levy, robbed $26,750 while refilling an ATM.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, while Brink's employees were refilling at the Newport ATM in Levy, thieves stole $26,750.
The driver of the car was preparing to empty the ATM of the entertainment complex and deliver more coins, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a release.
While he was working, another man "ran behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not identify how many people were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please call Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yes.
When he announced the change on Saturday, he tweeted: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, is sometimes nicknamed Ye, and that nickname was also used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his Saturday night live appearance, which is expected to be preceded by the release of his new album, Yandhi.
He will be appearing in the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who was cancelled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
As well as the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the radio host Big Boy and the title of his album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, and it's about us".
It begins with the single meaning of kanye, the reflection of all our good and evil, our confusion, becomes yes.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's one of the many famous rappers who change their name.
Sean Combs, known to various people as Puff Daddy, P. Ditty or Diddy, announced his choice of name this year: Love & Brother Love.
Jay-Z, West's previous collaborator, also used a hyphen with a vowel or capital letter.
Mexican AMLO vows to use no military force against civilians.
Andres Manuel López Obrador, elected president of Mexico, vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country marks the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in the Plaza del Tretorlo that "we will never use military force to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, when the leftist student movement was taking root in Latin America, the military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide monthly grants to those who study, to make the state universities more free and to support the young people of Mexico.
He said that youths were running into criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double its funding for A.I.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, says that as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field.
The comments came after the US government's various departments were notified of AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year: aiming to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling AI research budgets would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking to make the next leap in AI, Lee said.
Doubling the funding will double the chances of the next big thing in U.S. AI, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Horton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures and an investor in Face++, China's most famous AI company.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an AI system that beat America's top Oscillos, and later he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee has agreed to past U.S. government technology conferences such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and visited to help find the next visionary.
"The US researchers work hard to get government funding", Lee said.
"China is not stealing academic leadership; it is cooperating", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired university mentors to study AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policy would also help strengthen the U.S. effort on AI.
"I think that PhDs in AI should automatically be given a green card", he said.
China's State Council issued a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies paying researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic research in China is poor, Lee said.
In the United States, earlier this year, the Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which intends to involve partners from the corporate and academic communities, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US policy of creating an AI National Security Commission has been in limbo for months.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the name of the country.
Macedonians on Sunday called for a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" or to settle a decade-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a state called Macedonia, voted to join NATO and the EU, saying that the people of its north claim its territory.
The two governments signed an agreement in June under the newly proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of Macedonia's main Slavic population.
President Georgi Ivanov did not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voting rate would meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum to be valid.
Read the question about the referendum: "Do you agree to accept the agreement with Greece and become a member of NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worthwhile for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join institutions like the EU and NATO.
"I came to vote today for the young people of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
The Commissioner said that the Council would not be bound by law, but that the results of the vote would be respected by a sufficient number of members of Parliament to decide.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The week's election commissioner said no reports of fraud had been made by 1 p.m.:
However, the voter turnout remained at just 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dasko participated in the Macedonian referendum on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, on the name change of the country that will open the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, pulled a chair in front of a tent set up by people boycotting the referendum by preparing a small stage.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate carefully, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can rely on other countries like China and Russia to become part of the European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, with unemployment rates above 20 percent:
"I believe that the majority will support the EU and NATO, as more than 80 percent of the population support them", Zaev said after the vote:
He said the "yes" result would be "proof of our future".
According to the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a poll released last Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - below the required turnout.
In another poll conducted by Macedonian TV's Telema, 57 percent of respondents said they planned to vote on Sunday:
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
The referendum needs 50% and one vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
I recommend: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City to go beyond the full defence of Brighton to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the defence of Brighton on Sunday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, to give Manchester City a 2-0 win.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute with ridiculous ease.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the series.
He competed against three Brighton defenders before he went out on the open field.
Aguero and four other green shirts were surrounded.
He pushed one defender and knocked a few more at the end of the Brighton box.
And he found Sterling and made a path to his left.
England FW returned the ball to Aguero with a first touch inside the box and used his right boot to carry Brighton's keeper, Matthew Ryan, and hit the right side of the net.
"Aguero was struggling with a leg problem", City manager Pep Guardiola told Rivoter.
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored in that moment".
But it was Stirling who gave Sky Blue the starting advantage in the Premier League brawl.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful passageway along the left side to LeRoy-Sane.
Sunne kicked Sterling several times before he was sent to the post.
He put the ball in the net just before Sky Blue's forward slipped into the boundary.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein Necker Arena in Ginsheim, Germany.
Sharzer wants to play the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's little reason to start over.
But the struggling Sharzer is looking to mount a Sunday win over the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still playoff impact for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies are looking to win their first district title, at least a wild card spot, after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night.
"Even if we play meaningless, we can at least throw and the crowd will be together and it will be probably the highest level of play at any point in the year, in the atmosphere of Denver and any other team facing it.
You wouldn't want to fight like that, would you?"
The Nationals have not yet announced their Sunday starter, but they report that they will be pitching Sharzer in such a situation.
Scharzer is scheduled to make his 34th start and will pitch at the Sunday regular break, with plans to pitch in the bullpen season on Thursday.
This season, the Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president, speaking about the importance of Republican candidates in the midterm elections, referred to the situation where the Supreme Court's surroundings are choosing Brett Kavanaugh instead.
"Everything we've done has been in November.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big big one - I don't run, but I'm actually running, so I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates".
Trump continued, "Look at this awful group of Democratic extremists, and you'll see what's going on right now.
And they will find themselves disgusted and disgraceful, determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to ignore to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And we're going to see that over the next four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, disgusting, disgusting, and dishonest".
He has attracted the attention of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including nominating Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, and has received a large amount of public support.
"Do you remember what she said?"
Did you leak any documents?
Oh, what?
No, oh, no, I'm waiting for the worst body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
I can't stand people who talk their minds out.
I was hardly surprised when the Momentum activists of my local party voted to evacuate me.
After all, I'm in the front row of the Labour MPs who are said to be unwelcome - all of which speaks to the spirit.
My colleague, Joanne Ryan, a member of parliament, was treated similarly for standing up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the accusation was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and ironically, in Europe, were issues that Jeremy disagreed with past leaders.
In a statement at Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, he said: "We want to make the meeting inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was just that.
Sadly, the promise of a "more friendly and gentle" policy, which was not the tone of many meetings today, or if it had actually started, had long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not accept different views and that all views are only judged on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues who previously thought I shared similar political views started to expect me to turn around and take positions I had never taken before, such as agreeing on national security and the EU single market.
Whenever I spoke publicly - and I'm not saying that much - there was a continuing stream of harassment on social media, demanding the cancellation of the election, criticizing the Centre's policies, saying I shouldn't join the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I think I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face every day the whirlwind of sexism or racial abuse but never shy away from it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the extent to which abuse has become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn argued that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance:
It is true that we are no longer a broad church, and any "unconfident" movement or change in party selection rules is becoming less frequent.
Over the past two years, I've tried to be humble so as not to be too loud, and I've given a lot of advice that "everything will work out".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally destroyed my comprehensive school classrooms, I have worked hard to support better public services for those who need them most, whether they be local councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was confused about my policy positions and where I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the movement on Friday, I can say that the country is struggling to cope with Brexit that is damaging to families, businesses and our public services, and I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But my message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise not to suppress your actions based on my belief that outside threats or political convenience are in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Air 38-17, Melrose, undefeated air to the top.
Two late tries may have changed the final result somewhat, but Air definitely deserves to win today's spectacularly entertaining tenant premiership match.
They're at the top of the table now, and they're only 10 undefeated.
Finally, it was a good defense and a better chance to get home, and coach Peter Marty had every right to be happy.
"We have been tested throughout the match so far and we are still undefeated and we should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Trust in the air; they've got a better chance than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try for Fraser Climo pushed the air forward, but the Warriors opened the game, Lori Hughes' yellow card gave Melrose the numbers, and Jason Baggott took the unconverted try.
Clymo extended the lead in the air with a penalty just before half-time, and decided a solo try to break the air 17-5 in the end.
But Melrose came in second, and Baggott's Patrick Anderson's try was down to five points.
Afterwards, the long wait for the severely injured and retired Lourido Knott was followed by a further advance by Stafford McDowall's try for the Air Climax.
Air acting captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose withdrew at the end of the intense pressure spell, paying an extra player at Bruce Colvin's attempt.
However, the home side returned and again Stulane Hutchinson tackled Clymo without the ball, received a yellow card and landed behind the air mall where McPherson was advancing from the penalty line.
After Kyle Lowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong, Clymo almost re-started instead, sending Frank's Gregor Henry to the fifth try at home.
The Steel Game star is starting a new career in the restaurant industry.
Steel gamer Ford Kieran is ready to move into the hospitality industry after it's revealed he's been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56, is starring in a popular BBC show he writes and stars in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the show's last, and Keenan is apparently planning for life after Craig Gran.
According to official records, he is a director of Adrift Moor Limited.
A Scottish Sun source suggested Keenan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "active restaurant trade", but the actor declined to comment on the story.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia wants the courts to reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters with the ropes of Rapas.
The blue flag of the sea is flown over the public buildings.
From Lake Chichican to the Amazon, the naval base is covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
It is our duty to get it back".
The memory of the coastline lost in Chile in the bloody 19th century resource conflict through inland Bolivia is still vivid: the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
On October 1, Bolivia, after five years of deliberations, awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice, and these hopes are perhaps the best in decades.
"Bolivia has a strong, united and calm spirit and, of course, looks forward to the results with a positive outlook", said Roberto Carzadilla, the Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians, looking at the ICJ ruling on the national big screen, are optimistic that the Hague court will agree with Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia after decades of proper consultation.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial re-election next year, will also participate in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has not been given the authority to grant Chile territory and has not decided on the possible outcome of the talks.
The ICJ's decision, which came just six months after the final debate, shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the factors in Bolivia are far from advancing, and in the last four years, they may have been pushing back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
Morales's militant rhetoric, she suggested, had broken the goodwill of the remaining Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss until some point, but it is extremely difficult to continue to discuss after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodríguez Verte, representing the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift:
On Monday, Bolivia will be "a special opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile" and "put an end to 139 years of disagreements over mutual interests", he said.
Carzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the ocean issue as a political prop:
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to learn that you need to get over the past".
North Korea says that unless they can trust the United States, there will be no nuclear disarmament.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho says that if Washington cannot be trusted, his country will never disarm first.
Lee was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow through on the promises made during the Singapore summit between the rival leaders.
His comments are being interpreted as US ones: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be trying to reopen stalemated nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore, where North Korea's Kim Jong-un attended.
Li says that the US objection to the declaration to continue sanctions and end the Korean War is a "dream" that will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of Pyongyang agreeing to the declaration without first embarking on a major disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a skeptical view that Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning what is considered the only way to guarantee security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show is unveiling a massive new line of headwear, taking it to the high street near you.
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, this is the way to go.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a lineup of quirky oversize headgear for the runway's SS19 collection, which captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
The very unrealistic hats have been flooding Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching pieces to Catwalk.
Valentino's most striking work was a beige hat with a wide blade like a feather over the model's head.
Other oversized accessories, such as jewel-made suits, wizard hats, and even pineapples, were not designed to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown has released another collection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn up to the lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One piece was like a complete scuba diving gear with a snorkel and goggles, while the other piece was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to stick with your fashion philosophy, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the giant bonnet could go to the high street near you.
The oversized hats, from Rihanna to Emily Latjakovsky, are warming up on the heels of the La Bomba, a wheat hat with a two-foot-wide nail that can be seen by anyone.
The cult brand behind the very unrealistic hat that's flying on social media is sending another big piece to Catwalk -- a beach bag of straw, almost as big as a model in a swimsuit.
The orange-brown raffia bag with a raffia fringe and a white leather handle was a highlight of Jacques's La Rivière SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to big hats and beach bags on the high street next summer. With designers having such a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland have maintained academic excellence, and this is another set of excellent test results that is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community achievements, and continues through 2018.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), which has over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their guardians.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers and to live in society as global citizens.
In this sector, where custom-made school curricula can be designed and implemented, it is clear that modern languages will continue to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak in a language that you can understand, it goes into your head".
When you speak in their native language, it goes to their heart.
This reminds us that we should not rely on English alone when building relationships and trust with people in other countries.
Recent test results this year show that languages are at the top of the league table and private schools have the highest pass rates.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages obtained a higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students learning Beijingese also achieved a higher grade A, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are encouraging foreign language learning as an important skill that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages are treated as optional subjects in private school curricula, like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 UK Employment Skills Commission survey found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies are due to lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a world where globalization is increasing the number of job opportunities that require languages.
Whatever career you choose, if you are learning a foreign language, you will have acquired these life skills, which will be really beneficial in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners means that multilingual talent can be a competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75% of them do not have sufficient foreign language skills to converse and the proportion of those who can speak a second-digit foreign language is only 15%, French.
That's why it's important for kids today to invest in language education.
For children, especially in developing countries, multilingualism will increase the chances of getting meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the language of instruction differs from school to school.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most important to the UK, such as Beijing and Japanese, in view of 2020.
In private schools, where teachers are specialists in this field, there are plenty of language options, regardless of what the child is interested in.
Private schools in Scotland are focused on providing a learning environment where children can develop the skills they need to prepare for and succeed in the future, whatever the future.
In the global business environment, languages continue to be crucial to the future of a country, and this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and even better education to young people in Scotland.
I'm not going to do it.
John Edward is a member of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron, the Lakers are making their debut in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James will soon be making his debut for the highly anticipated Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers manager Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But I don't know how many minutes he's going to play.
"It's going to be a minute and 48 minutes less", Walton says on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will only play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need a pre-season game to prepare for the season", he says.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including in Trump-friendly locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the Supreme Court nomination pending, Trump is seeking to consolidate his support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing their majority in the November election.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online on the following YouTube live stream:
With the FBI investigating the sexual assault of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and with the Senate nomination vote delayed by up to a week and the situation tense, Trump is likely to comment on Kavanaugh's public hearing this week.
But the main purpose of the ongoing rally is to give a boost to the Republican forces facing a difficult battlefield in the run-up to the November elections.
That's why the Trump campaign says the five rallies next week are aimed at "strengthening volunteers and supporters to maintain and expand Republican majority seats in the Senate and House".
"Securing a majority of seats in Congress is very important to his policies, so the president will be visiting as many states as possible for the busy election season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
According to Metro News in West Virginia, tonight's rally at West Bank Arena in Wheeling "may draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media".
Trump won West Virginia in 2016 by more than 40 percent, but Saturday's visit to West Virginia will be Trump's second in a month.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said that "the president's coming to back him up is not a good sign for Morrissey".
Ryder Cup 2018: The USA qualifiers are showing a willingness to fight with hope for Sunday's singles.
After three sessions of one-sided results, the Saturday afternoon Fourth of July was just the development that needed this Ryder Cup.
In sports, the concept of "force" like a pendulum is unfounded, but especially in these competitions, the athlete really believes in "force".
So which one is going to have the momentum?
"We had a six-point lead, but now we're four points ahead, so I think we're a little bit ahead", Jordan Spears says as he pulls up at the end of the day.
Of course, the European team has a four-point lead with 12 games left and is in the lead.
Speece says the U.S. team is feeling the wind, and there are many positive factors, including the fact that they've been playing together all day and that Speece and Justin Thomas are doing well, each with three points in four games.
Spears has been relentless from tee to green, leaving a record of exemplary results.
He and Thomas led by two points after two holes, but as the round progressed, the cries of blessing grew, and the decisive pot sank, equalling the fourth game.
The same cheers he raised at the 15th hole, when he put in a pot and won, conveyed his belief that the USA team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus on your game and do your best", says Spears.
Now, these players are only one game each.
The 18th hole is a win.
The only players to score more points than Spears and Thomas in the last two days are the two most talked about players in the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
These two, the quirky and beloved European selections, have won four of their four matches without making a mistake.
The pair, known as "Mollywood", were not only the only pair not to have bogeyed in the Saturday afternoon session, but also avoided bogeying on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the late 9th hole of Friday morning.
In addition to the match performance and the energy flowing between the two in the wild crowd, it is clear that they are the players who should be beaten on Sunday, and that no player is more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari, who will not move the European selection victory in the final of Le Golf National.
I want them to do it in another hall at the same time.
However, the European selection has not yet been decided.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson easily beat the heroes of the morning game, Sergio Garcia and Alex Nolen.
Garcia and Lennon were unable to turn around after digging the grave with a bogie and two double bogie on the ninth hole in the first half.
On Sundays, there are no friends to help.
Forball and Forsam are very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the two pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the momentary changes in strategy.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading the way towards the final day, but this Fourth Session has shown that the US team is willing to fight, especially to clear the uncertainty of the American side.
Ryder Cup final day, European selection is 10-6 up.
The European selection is 10-6 ahead of the USA selection after Saturday's game against Foursome, and is on a strong run towards the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The team of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who have been playing well, have won two of their last four games at Le Golf National, beating the struggling Tiger Woods by two points.
Thomas Bayon's European selection, which was looking to win back the trophy it lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the uncomfortable US selection at the morning's football, with a score of 3-1.
The USA team regained their form at Fortham and won two matches, but still failed to break the point gap.
The USA team, led by Jim Furyk, will need to score eight points in Sunday's singles 12 to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood not only became the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, but Fleetwood and Molinari, who became known as "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four games in their first four games.
The pair won the match, after defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the footy, with a remarkable combination of five and four, even more striking for the discouraged Woods and Rookie's Bryson Deschambeau team.
Woods, who has been unable to improve in two matches on Saturday, has also shown some good form, but has not only lost 19 of his 29 games with Fortham, but also seven in a row.
After a break in the morning's football, Justin Rose, along with Henrik Stenson, beat the world's first and third-ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppa 2-1 at Fortham.
The south-west course of Paris was a good day for a good wind, but the European selection did not dominate as it should.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spears and Justin Thomas, who scored two points on Saturday, set the benchmark for the U.S. team.
They showed their fighting spirit in Foorball, winning 2-1 against the Spaniards John Rum and Ian Poulter, and losing the first two holes at Fortham, winning 4-3 against Poulter and Rory McIlroy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, there have only been two times in the past when the four-point margin in singles has been reversed, but the United States under Furyk can hold the trophy by drawing.
But for the US electorate, which has been in a two-day slump, Sunday's counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions have increased mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances, it will not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Foreign Minister Lee Hyeong-ho said at the UN Annual General Meeting that North Korea has taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, including a pledge to stop nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantle nuclear laboratories, and not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But I don't see any significant response from the United States", he said.
"If we cannot trust the United States, then we will lose confidence in our national security, and we will not unilaterally disarm under such circumstances".
Li repeated the usual North Korean dissatisfaction that there is no reward from the US government for North Korea's "phased" denuclearization approach, but his statement is significant in that, unlike before, the North Korean government did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization.
During his first summit with the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Li referred to Kim Jong-un's joint statement that he would work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump's pledge to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US says North Korea must first give up nuclear weapons.
The US government also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is opposed to the 'end of the war declaration' by insisting on 'denuclearization first' and applying further pressure through sanctions to achieve the goal by force", Foreign Minister Lee said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us down is the illusion of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that our suspicions are being strengthened by the continuation of sanctions.
Li made no mention of the plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which President Trump stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the non-nuclear issue was not the United States, and not Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone so far".
Even so, Foreign Minister Lee's tone is dramatically different from when he called Trump "the evil president" and said at last year's UN General Assembly that North Korea's rocket would inevitably reach the US mainland after Trump called him "the rocket man" in a suicide bombing campaign.
Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Gold for his courage in his disarmament efforts at the UN this year, but said there were many challenges and that sanctions needed to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame, saying it "would take two or three years, five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should retaliate for the measures taken by North Korea.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must be strictly maintained until it is verified that complete and final denuclearization has taken place".
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 for blocking funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile development.
Pompeo said he had met with Foreign Minister Lee during the UN General Assembly and would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was fruitless.
He left Pyongyang in July and said there had been progress, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gang-like demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with President Wu this month to dismantle its missile and nuclear facilities if the US takes "responsive measures".
He told him that the money he was asking for was a "response" to the security promised by Trump in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with the US government.
I'm a Harvard student taking a course on getting enough rest.
This year's new course at Harvard University aims to get all undergraduates to get more sleep to combat the spread of the machismo culture of caffeine-drinking and "all-night" study.
Students at the world's top Harvard universities are often ignorant of very basic things like how to use their bodies.
Charles Twisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He said he got the idea to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl student came to me and said, 'Why am I only in fourth grade when I hear this story?'
"I was surprised that no one had ever taught her the importance of sleep", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is the first of its kind this year, will explain to students how good sleep habits can promote learning and physical activity and improve general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, says the university decided to introduce the course after it noticed a severe lack of sleep among students that week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can learn about the effects of caffeine and light on the coffee cup, curtains, sneakers, or books in the dorm room, the effects of sleep deprivation on physical activity, and the importance of a day's sleep schedule.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map, which features interactive icons, encourages participants to think about the curriculum.
"I know that student behavior doesn't change overnight.
But they should have a right to know, just as they have a right to know how their smoking choices affect their health", adds Professor Tsaiesler.
He also said that a culture of "all-night study" still exists, and that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
He says that getting enough sleep is the "secret weapon" of students fighting stress, fatigue and anxiety, and that lack of sleep keeps the brain in a hunger mode, always hungry, and prevents weight gain.
Raymond Sauer, 19, a California chemistry and physical biology student, helped design his course after taking a class with Professor Tuesler at Harvard last year as a freshman.
He was awakened by the course and wanted to expand the course to the entire campus.
The next step he wants is for all graduate students to have the same learning program before they start studying at the highly competitive Harvard.
Professor Tsaiesler recommends that students set alarms at bedtime as well as at bedtime, and that they beware of the harmful "blue light" effects of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, Menga's goal to take down the Rangers led by Gerald
Rangers suffered another defeat on the road: a goal from Livingston's Dory Menga, which was a 1-0 loss to the Rangers, who were missing out on a draw from Steven Gerrard.
Rangers, who are based in the Eyebrooks, were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but lost to Gary Holt's Livingston, Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, and Rangers are eight points clear of Scottish Premiership holders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time, but then it was not seen that the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, were able to score.
Rangers are currently in sixth place, but Livingston have risen to third place behind Hibernian on points.
Also, the fact that Judge Clam Spence was thrown from the side of the road and had to undergo treatment for a head injury could cause further trouble for the Rangers.
Gerard made eight changes to the team as they broke the air and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, maintained the same eleven as when he took the points from Hearts last week; he must have been pleased that the well-trained members had tormented his opponent in every situation.
Rangers won by ownership, but Livingston attacked more effectively with fewer positions.
Just two minutes into the game, midfielder Scott Pittman, from the first pass of the manga, kicked Alan McCreeger's defending goal, but missed the decisive opportunity by going off the sidelines.
Then, Keegan Jacobs' free kick in the penalty area was taken by captain Craig Hulket, and defending player Alan Risgo was able to shoot, but only to hit the back post.
Rangers dominated the ball, but in the final third they ended up playing on hopeful observations rather than a play of confidence.
Colombian Alfred Morelos claimed a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes, but Steven Thompson dismissed Morelos' appeal.
The Rangers fired two shots in the first half, but former Rangers GK Liam Kelly easily saved a monotonous shot by Lasagna Cribbari's heading and Obier Ejercia.
The 34th minute of the first half in Livingston was against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that it was also the result of hard work.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle Jacob's set piece in the penalty area.
Declan Gallagher passes to Scott Robinson, who calmly passes to Menga, who scores easily, but Scott Arfield can't handle it.
Gerard switched Ryan Kent for Cribbari at half-time, but this soon worked, and the winger's Cribbari sent a pass to Morelos, but Kelly came out ahead of the goal line and blocked the ball with a good save.
But Livingston, with his own good game-play, handled the long balls with precision, with Risgo and Hulket passing in succession.
Livingston, led by Holt, had a chance to extend the lead in the end, but Jacobs' shot was blocked by McCleger's favourite save, and Risgour's head shot from the corner was later sidelined.
Glen Middleton of Rangers, who was on the way, appealed the penalty when he got into trouble with Jacobs, but Thompson again threw it away.
He invented the Geiger counter.
Page one of the Sunday Morning Almanac: On this day, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a major force in science, as seen in the 1950 film The Bell of the Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the unlikely cowboy scientist.
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium".
"If you put on a headphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radiation in the mineral".
Evans: "That's right. It sounds good!"
"Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" the bad cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" and kill the bad cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize the bad cells as part of the treatment.
And this is what we do.
This allows the cells to "identify" the proteins common to many cancers and re-inject them.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in a wide range of cancer patients.
In the case of women who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer was eliminated for more than 18 months.
In this way, when the immune cells are extracted from the patient and modified in the laboratory, a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, can be "identified" and then re-injected into the cell.
"Our results show that the vaccine is effective", said Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer", explains Professor Berzowski.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells, has been effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was wearing a MAGA cap on SNL and was running for Trump.
That's what you get for being a bad name.
Kanye West has been booed by the media for his controversial endorsement of President Donald Trump during his Saturday Night Live appearance, saying he will run in 2020.
West, after singing the third song of the night, "Ghost Town", with a MAGA cap, lashed out at Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people and they've said, 'How can you like Trump if he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago".
The SNL began with a scene starring Hollywood star Matt Damon, who auditioned for Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blazy Ford.
The video of West's outrage was never aired, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock the West with his post.
West also complained to the audience that he had struggled behind the scenes for the hat.
"I was bullied by these guys backstage.
They say, "Don't go out with your hat on".
I'm really being bullied!
And the Washington Examiner says, "I'm in the bottom of the barrel".
West said, "What do you want to see?" And he went on, "I'm gonna wrap my Superman coat, because then nobody can tell me what to do.
Then we can try love".
His comments were followed by at least two bowing from the audience, and the SNL cast seemed puzzled, Variety reported, with one attendee reporting: "The whole studio was quiet again".
West was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West dressed in a peri-bottle costume and sang "I Love It", which stunned many.
Candice Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, tweeted in support of West: "To the bravest of spirits: Thank you for standing up to the mob".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "they, and it's very, very great".
"But I choose not to reward people who spread ideologies that are harmful to my community (by buying his music, clothes, or supporting his 'art').
He's free.
"We are too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Paf Daddy, Paffy, P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg is also known as Snoop Lion, and of course the music legend Prince, after changing his name to Symbol, and even "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince".
He's charged with attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant.
A man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday and a 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder.
Police say the incident happened in Bally Hackmore.
On Monday, the defendant is scheduled to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, is attacking the toxic masculinity of the world.
Kit Harrington is best known as John Snow, the swordsman in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Kit, 31, attacked this stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of the role on screen, boys feel they have to be strong to be respected by others.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something is wrong" and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she felt "very strong" about dealing with the issue.
"We feel very strongly, personally, right now, what we did wrong with masculinity", he said.
"What have you taught these young boys about the problems we're facing?"
Kit thinks that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to its very masculine characters.
He goes on to say: "What is innate and what is taught?
Do boys not feel they have to be men with certain qualities because of what they see on TV and on the street?
I think this is one of the big problems of our time, but how do we change it?
When you look at a young man, it's obvious that something is wrong".
In the interview, he also admitted that he "no longer has to deal with the battlefield and the horses", and that he will not talk about the prequel or sequel after the end of Game of Thrones next summer.
From November, I'll be starring in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who get involved in a robbery.
He says the best thing about Game of Thrones lately is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on the show, so in a way she gave me a future family and a life from now on", he says.
Rose played Igrit, Kit's lover, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
They married in June 2018 at their home in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% surge in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS:
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say:
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, and changes from the past have been observed.
In China, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero in this way, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But in China, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
In China, the LGBT community is facing a serious problem with HIV transmission through sexual intercourse.
In China, where homosexuality was legalized in 1997, discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Research estimates that 70 to 90 percent of gay men will eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Many infections occur in these relationships because of a lack of precautions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make more HIV drugs widely available as part of its efforts to address the problem.
He denied the leaked data of Republican Senator Maxine Waters and her staff, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied Saturday that one of her staffers posted personal information on three Republican senators on her Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claims that this claim is being made by "ultra-right" critics and websites:
"Lies, lies, vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter:
The leaked information reportedly included the home address and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Olin Hatch.
The information was posted online by an anonymous figure on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on Thursday on the sexual assault allegations of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The data leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pandit and RedState have claimed that the IP addresses they post are from Waters' office and have also disclosed information about Waters' employees, The Hill reports.
"This unfounded claim is a complete lie, absolutely a lie", Waters continued.
"My staff, despite the fact that their identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, have nothing to do with this leak.
This unfounded claim is a complete lie, absolutely false".
Waters's statement was immediately criticized online by people including former White House correspondent Ali Fleisher:
"This denial is only anger", wrote Fleisher.
"This showed that she was not fit to be a member of parliament.
If you are accused of something you did not do, do not be angry.
Do not be arrogant.
You must not question the motives of the accused.
You have to be calm and calm".
Fryscher seems to be comparing the criticism of Democrats who were too angry about Judge Kavanaugh's conduct at Thursday's public hearing to Waters' reaction.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking a seat for Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts:
"It's great to be true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters says her office "communicated these false claims to the authorities and the police".
"We will do everything we can to find the culprits", she says, "and hold them, my staff, legally accountable for their destructive and dangerous actions".
"Johnny English's Analogue Retaliation" is a film that is a powerless parody.
Recently, it has become a trend for new films about the UK's downturn to find Brexit's meaning, and it seems that the same is true of the follow-up action comedy by Johnny English, which has already been followed by Johnny English in 2003 and Johnny English: The Reward for Leisure in 2011.
Could this ironic satire on how incompetent we are be Britain's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unfit Johnny English, with his eyes popping out and his face rubbery, is repeating his delusions in this work. His name suggests, more than anything else, that he is a comedy made for non-English film lovers.
He's, of course, a stupid secret agent who misunderstands his sophisticated charm and takes a wild turn, but he has all the elements of Officer Cruzeau, Mr Bean, and the one who played the flaming runner theme song at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
Johnny English was originally based on a now-forgotten Barkley-card TV commercial starring Atkinson as a mysterious world traveler who causes trouble everywhere.
There's one or two good scenes in this latest one.
Johnny English approaches the helicopter in a medieval robe, and the rotor blade hits the helmet and makes a sound.
Atkinson's comedic talents are also evident, but the humor is rather weak and strangely redundant, especially considering that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible are increasingly incorporating comedy elements.
The humor felt like it was for adults, not children, and for me, Johnny English's quirky adventures were not as original or focused as Mr. Bean's silent film gag.
The film is based on the current persistent theme that Britain is in serious trouble.
When a cyber hacker infiltrates the British top-secret spy web network and exposes the identities of all the British agents in operation, the top agent (a small role for Kevin Elton, unfortunately) is left in a daze.
For the already troubled and disenfranchised Prime Minister, the news was beyond the pale. Emma Thompson, who plays the parody role of Theresa May, is not far behind in the script.
Her wise counsel said that since the identities of all active spies were now public, she had only to call in retired spies.
So there's Johnny English, who works as a school principal and teaches people how to be secret agents, hopefully in secret. There are some interesting gags in the English spy academies like the School of Rock.
English heads to the White House for a quick briefing and reunites with his long-suffering former colleague, Ben Miller.
Boff is now married to the submarine commander.
And then the Queen's Secret Service is back in the saddle, and she meets the beautiful Femme Fatale, Ofelia Britova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has been led to believe that charismatic billionaire Jason Volta (Jake Lacey) can solve the UK's computer problems.
English and Boff cause a number of problems, as they have before: they pose as waiters, set fire to a luxury French restaurant, make a fuss trying to break into Volta's luxury yacht, and cause a lot of confusion when English tries to use a virtual reality headset to find out what's inside Volta's house.
Although all the tricks are concentrated in the last mountain, this lovely comedy of the twisted and twisted seems to be a children's show in general.
It's pretty commonplace.
And as I felt in other Johnny English films, the British film industry couldn't help but wonder if Rowan Atkinson could be given a role that was worthy of his talent.
Labour denies that it is considering a plan to pay the public five days' wages for a four-day workweek.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is likely to consider a radical plan whereby citizens will be paid five days for four days of work a week.
The party wants corporate executives to share the money gained through the AI revolution with workers by increasing wages.
The plan is that employees will work three days a week with the same pay.
The source said the idea is in line with the party's economic policy and plans to make the country more worker-friendly.
The move to a four-day week is also being endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "The review of the policy is due to be announced by the end of the year.
"It is not something that can be done overnight, but the four-day work week is a goal that fits the party's approach to reorganizing the economy in favour of workers and the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, so this is not the first time Labour has endorsed the idea.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not currently in favour of that goal.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy and the party has not considered it".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell, at last week's Labour Conference, embodied his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "faceless executives" of the public utility company and "unfair beneficiaries".
The shadow minister's plan also means that the Labour government can "cut back" on the grounds that it has detected irregularities and that the water company's current shareholders may not be able to recover their entire stake.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the company's board, create a comprehensive ownership fund and deposit 10% of the private company's capital there, with employees receiving an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" discuss whether the FBI might change its mind about the Kavanaugh investigation.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency's findings could jeopardize the Republican Senate's gains.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Perry asked Republican Senators Lindsay Gramm and John Kennedy if they could find anything that would change the FBI's mind.
Kennedy was more open than Graham, his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I'd be in the hearing. I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And after that, because there was an accusation, I called him and said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined and clear.
But the Gram vote seems unchangeable.
"As for Bret Cavanaugh, I am determined that he will be severely criticised", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it vehemently". Graham added, referring to Christine Bligeyford.
"And no one who mentioned her name could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizens Festival? Has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting its annual music event, the Global Citizens Festival, where many of the most impressive stars perform, but equally impressive is its mission to end poverty in the world.
This year's seventh annual Global Citizens Festival brings tens of thousands of people to Central Park's Lawn Square to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, as well as to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international human rights organization that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless they wanted to buy VIP tickets), concert attendees had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" that involved volunteering, emailing, calling world leaders, or otherwise taking some meaningful step to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how much has the Global Citizen Festival achieved in 12 years?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert reward and convincing them to take action a sincere way, or is it another case of "clickism", like signing an online petition or tweeting just to feel like you've done something meaningful?
Since 2011, Global Citizens says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of supporters and is pushing for various goals:
Such actions have led world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the funds provided have directly affected some 649 million people worldwide so far.
Key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK-based investors and implementers that pledges to "help children grow to their full potential". The group has received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition from the country.
"With the support of the UK government, funders, governments and global citizens like yourself, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past".
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children have been carried out in the UK and the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will deliver nutrition support to 5 million women and children.
And I asked him if he could answer the question on the website, "Do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes it will fail".
But we have the power, and together we will succeed, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will be performing at the event, which will be held in New York this year, and will be hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to blockade Russian energy exports.
The U.S. government can rely on the Navy in the Middle East, including the region, "if necessary", to prevent Russian energy from hitting the market, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink has revealed, the Washington Examiner reported.
Zink argued that Russia's involvement in Syria is a pretext for opening up new energy markets, especially if it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he was reported to have said.
According to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the silos are open and block energy from entering the market if necessary", he said.
Zink was speaking at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that is building its status as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that the two companies are virtually the same:
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use more or less fuel instead", he said, referring to Russia as an economically fossil-fuel-dependent "ventriloquist pony".
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to promote liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as a much cheaper alternative to Russia for European consumers.
That's why the Trump administration, including President Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to drop the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.
The US stance provoked a German backlash, and Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The BDI, the main German industrial association, has called on the US to refrain from commenting on EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem that third countries are interfering with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempe, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully investigate" her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, says a Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "carefully investigate" the presidential candidate after the midterm elections on Saturday.
At the town hall in Horry York, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a run for office.
According to Hill, "It's time for women to come to Washington and rebuild a broken government, including women at the top", she said.
"After November 6th, I will be looking closely at the presidential candidates".
Warren joined the debate during the town hall about President Donald Trump, saying he "led this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", she said.
Warren has been a bitter critic of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents did not think she would run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Science Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "highly likely" Massachusetts voters said a senator should not run.
32% voted in favour of the candidate.
In a poll, the majority of voters supported former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of a candidate and 48 percent opposing.
Other Democratic politicians who have been discussed as potential candidates for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January:
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump.
Trac Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged Monday night in a domestic violence case.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes home, I feel for other families who are feeling the devastating effects of PTSD and the wounds that soldiers are suffering when they come home", she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Parlin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, stubborn, wondering if they have the same respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen, and all other members of the military have given to their country".
According to Wausau Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested Monday in Wausau, Alaska, for obstructing reports of domestic violence and the possession of firearms at the time, and charged with domestic violence against women.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a motion to dispute the new refugee policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and special districts filed court advisory reports in Washington on Friday supporting the petition against the policy on asylum seekers, according to NBC News.
The Grace Sessions case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, but the full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and "his violent gang members" had abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney who supports Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing widespread gang and domestic violence and that the United States is receiving a large number of asylum applications.
The new U.S. refugee policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum without documents.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Raskin said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all refugee claims be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a hurdle violates its principles", the court counsel's report said.
The Secretary further stated in the report that immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce", while the policy of denying them entry will hurt the US economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration officers no longer be given shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum is not intended to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious ones, that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue operations in Pal, where the death toll is doubling, in the battle for survivors.
For the survivors, the situation became more and more dire.
"She looks very nervous", said 35-year-old mother Lisa Kusma, who gave birth to a hot baby boy in a burnt-out palm shelter.
"An ambulance will be here in about a minute to pick up a person.
There's hardly any clean water".
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their flooded belongings and trying to rescue whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital was full of people damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered injuries to his back and shoulders, were resting outside Paul's Army Hospital, where they were being treated outside because of the strong aftershocks.
Tears flowed in his eyes when he remembered the moment when the fifth floor of the hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter was shaken by a violent earthquake.
"There was no time to run away.
"I think I was caught in a collapsed wall", Harris told AP News, "and the family said they were in town for the wedding".
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then I couldn't hear her.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope you're all right".
The US ambassador is accused of "bullying" by Chinese "advertising".
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the Chinese US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US newspaper for propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied China's attempts to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, and later referred to a paid advertisement in the state's largest newspaper, the Demeine Register.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election represent a new phase in Washington's campaign to increasingly pressure China, as US officials told Reuters.
While trade promotion ads are commonplace for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of an expanding trade war that imposes uniform tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts said that retaliatory tariffs imposed by China at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Trump-led Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador to the United States and longtime governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China's Branstad wrote in his Sunday opinion column in the Domino Register: "The invasion of propaganda ads against our country's press freedom is intensifying".
According to Branstad, "The Chinese government is exploiting the important traditions of free speech and freedom of the press in the United States for its own benefit by posting paid advertisements on the Demosyne Register to spread propaganda".
"In contrast, here in Beijing, the newsstands on the side of the road are only a limited dissent, and they don't really reflect the different opinions that Chinese people might have about China's chaotic economic trajectory. The media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
"One of the most prominent newspapers in China avoided publishing my article", he added, but avoided mentioning which newspaper specifically.
Analysts warn that the unrest over Mr. Kavanaugh could drive women Republican voters further away before the midterm elections.
In response to multiple sexual assault allegations, many Republican leaders are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Analysts warn that the Republicans will face a backlash from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The riots have caused very strong emotions: most Republicans are said to be hoping to go to the polls already.
In an article published in The Hill on Saturday, Professor Grant Liller, of the Political Science Department at Lacus University's Maxwell School, said: "You can't go back and verify the facts".
Professor Lear said it was doubtful whether Senator Jeff Flake's push for an FBI investigation at the tail end of the campaign was enough to quell voter anger.
According to a Washington, D.C., newspaper, on Friday, Carine Jean Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group Movement One, said: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget what will happen tomorrow. This will be remembered until November".
Friday morning, when the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee chose to push forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Brasley Ford, protesters in front of the Senate shouted, "November is coming!"
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be unfathomable", said non-party political analyst Steve Rosenberg to the news site.
"Some say it was originally high, but it is true.
But this may be even higher, especially for women voters in the urban, non-partisan electorate and young voters aged 18 to 29, who do not have a good opinion of the president, but who are generally characterized by low voting rates".
In the face of Ford's public testimony that he was sexually assaulted by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that there could be a backlash if the Republicans go ahead with the approval.
According to NBC News, Michael Souter, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said last week that "this riot is causing a lot of chaos at the GOP".
Guy Cecil, a Democrat campaign sponsor, told the news channel: "The issue is not just the committee vote or the final vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed. The issue is how the Republicans handle this uproar and how they handle her".
However, the American public seems divided as to which of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony should be believed, and which seems to be the majority opinion.
According to a survey by Yugava, 41% of respondents said they absolutely/probably believe Ford's testimony, while Kavanaugh was 35%.
In addition, 38 percent said Mr. Kavanaugh was probably/absolutely lying in his testimony, compared to 30 percent for Mr. Ford.
Under Mr. Flake's influence, the FBI is also investigating the testimony of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who testified to Mr. Ford, the Guardian reports.
Mr. Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he was assaulted by Mr. Kavanaugh while he was 17 years old, while he was drunk.
Mr. Ramirez also testified that a Supreme Court nominee had exposed his genitals at a Yale University party in the 1980s.
And I'm going to start a new Internet that will replace the inventors of the World Wide Web, Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project by tech legend Lee, and is based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid gives users options on where data is stored and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was "to rule the world".
And they say about start-ups, "This is something we need to do right now".
"This is a historic moment".
This app allows you to create your own "personal online data store" using Solid technology.
This includes contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It can be used simultaneously from one browser, such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, or Spotify.
The unique feature of personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
Inrupt calls it "empowerment of the individual through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the right skills so that everyone can use Solid.
Inrupt is currently made up of a community of developers and volunteer coders who have signed on to the security platform and project purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, and IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own distributed apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are talking about "implementing a complete change in the business models of Facebook and Google that will be overturned overnight".
"I'm not asking them for permission".
In a press release Saturday, Berners-Lee said of Inrupt, "Our mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that ensure the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994 and revolutionized the Internet.
Berners-Lee has been making influential statements in the debate over net neutrality over the past few months.
Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute, even as he continues to launch Inrupt.
"I'm very optimistic about the next generation of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A celebration will be held to honor the Victorian Order of the First World War
A celebration was held in his home town 100 years after he was the only Anglican clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a war hero during the First World War.
The Rev. Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his actions at Berengrie and Lourdes.
However, he did not know that he had been killed by a sniper four days later, with the highest honours in the British Army.
On Saturday, a parade was held in Rushden, Northamptonshire, and a memorial plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said the monument was "incredibly symbolic" and was unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's medal achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led a battalion through the Canal de Saint-Canton "under very thick fog and the fierce fire of the front and machine guns".
Then, with "great courage", he rushed to the front of the line of fire, with a small gun in one hand, pushed the front back and shot down three squadrons.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, exactly one month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says of his grandfather's behavior, "It's something I can't imitate, but it's also humiliating".
He and his brother Dr James Van held a grand celebration after the parade, led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Van said: "It was a great honour to participate in the parade", adding: "The courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support of many people".
All I saw was MMA fans and Pepper Pigs who spent the whole night watching Bellator 206.
Imagine how it felt to not see the main event, despite having spent the whole night looking forward to seeing Velotron 206.
The San Jose Bills consisted of 13 games, six of which were played on the main card, and were broadcast overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Geoghegan Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the match, the airwaves switched to Pepperpig, which surprised British viewers.
The spectators, who had stayed up until early in the morning, were particularly disappointed by this confrontation.
One fan tweeted about his involvement in a children's show, saying it was "a kind of bad joke".
Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Marketing and Communications at Bellator, said: "At 6am, it seems that the government's regulations that martial arts is not suitable for viewing forced us to switch to children's shows".
"It's a good thing you're a pepper-pig".
The president of Belator, Scott Cocker, said he would consider adjusting the schedule in the future to take account of the UK audience.
"I'm not sure what's going to happen until we get back on the air", Coker says.
"However, it was six o'clock on Sunday morning, so we could not adjust to our Sunday or Monday broadcast time in the UK.
I'm in the process of adjusting.
When the show switched, there were a lot of texts going on, all of them dissatisfied.
I tried to get it back to normal. I thought there was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen in the next show.
I'm going to try to reduce the number of games from six to five, but I'm not going to do it.
This was a sad situation".
I'm not sure what I'm talking about.
Olympic diver Tom Daly grew up feeling inferior in terms of sexuality, but that was the motivation for his success.
The 24-year-old Dalle, a player, didn't realize that he was different from the kids around him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren LaBerne, Dale - a player - spoke about gay rights as a way to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent has made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Karsty Young, had been out of action for several months due to illness.
In his first show, Laverne, who appeared as a cast member, said that the Dalí felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He says: "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and exclusion has always been real and has given me strength and strength for success".
He said he wanted to prove to himself that he was "worth something" and that he didn't want to disappoint anyone if his sexuality was revealed one day.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a powerful LGBT campaigner, appearing at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year and appealing to more countries to legalize homosexuality.
The dancer says she is lucky to be able to live her life without being disrupted by her sexuality, and that she speaks out to give others "hope".
Three-time world champion Dalle, who said she fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, said it was "a surprise" when she met him in 2013.
The actor married the Oscar winner, 20 years his junior, but said the age difference was not a problem at all.
"I've been through a lot since I was very young", says Dale, who first competed in the Olympics at age 14. Three years later, his father died of cancer.
The couple became parents in June. The son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, he says, "changed all our values" with the birth of his son.
"If you were asked about this last year, you would have said that winning the gold medal is everything", he says.
"But in reality, there is something more important than an Olympic gold medal.
"For me, the Olympic gold medal is the lobby".
His son, Robert, was diagnosed with a brain tumor and took the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
The Dalí says his father could not accept death. One of his last words was, "Have you got your tickets for the 2012 London Games?" He said he wanted to see the fight in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that I was no longer in this world when I was watching the battle on the front lines", he says.
"I held my father's hand until he stopped breathing, and when he stopped breathing, I realized for the first time that he was not invincible", she says.
The following year, she competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment, I thought this was all I wanted in life. I thought there was no better feeling than diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics".
The experience also inspired the first selection of the Dalé player. Heather Small's "Proud" has something to do with his growing up process on the way to the Olympics.
This is the first time I've ever heard of this.
On Saturday, at the Ryder Cup, Mickelson, who was unwell, came off the bench.
Phil Mickelson, the American, is set to set a new record in Sunday's 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to re-evaluate his form to avoid unfortunate results.
Mickelson, who is looking to set a record of 12 appearances in the biennial event, was ordered to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for the Foershall and Fortham on Saturday.
Mickelson, a five-time major champion, has been the focus of attention at many competitions in the United States. This time, he will leave his role and participate in the competition while turning to the support. The goal is to eliminate the cause of the ailment.
For him, this is the pinnacle of his career, but the driver is not perfectly linear. The 48-year-old Mickelson is not in the ideal condition to challenge the Le Golf National Course, where the long graph leads to misses.
The course itself is tough, but in Sunday's ninth match, he's up against the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the United States starts 12 singles matches with four points down, it will be a heated battle from the start, and Mickelson's game will be decisive.
Mr. Furyk said he trusted Mickelson but didn't say much else.
"He understood the role he had to play today, and he would pat me on the back and say that he was ready for tomorrow", says Furyk.
"I think you're confident enough".
He's a Hall of Fame player who has contributed so much to the team in the past, and that's not going to change this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but I made this adjustment.
He wants to play more, as everyone else thinks".
Mickelson will beat Nick Fardt on Sunday to set the record for most appearances in a Ryder Cup match.
This could end Mickelson's Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his personal best.
Mickelson's record stands at 18-20-7; however, Furyk says his presence provides a spiritual foundation for the team.
"He's funny, he's ironic, he likes to make people laugh, and he's grateful to be in the team room", she explained.
"I think the young players are enjoying working with him this week. It was fun to watch".
He brings more than play".
And I'm sure that the big lead is going to disappear soon.
European captain Thomas Bayon has seen firsthand that the situation can change, even if he leads the lead at the start of the Ryder Cup final day singles.
The Danish player made his debut for Valderrama in 1997. The team, led by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the United States, but somehow managed to win by a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
After watching the 2018 team win 5-3 at Le Golf National on Friday and lead 10-6 yesterday, Bion, pictured, said, "Remember, we were leading big in Valderrama. We were leading big in Brookline, but we lost. We were leading big in Valderrama, but we won by a narrow margin.
This history shows me and my team that we are still undecided.
So, I'm going to do my best tomorrow.
I just go out and do what I have to do.
The game is not over until the score is displayed.
We have a goal, and that is to win the trophy. We will put all our efforts towards this goal.
I've been saying this for a long time, I'm very passionate about my 12 players on my team, but I know what they are, they are the best players in the world".
While expressing his pleasure at his team's performance on the difficult golf course, Mr. Bayon adds: "We never try to be arrogant.
Tomorrow is tomorrow's enemy.
Tomorrow is a different element of personal performance.
It's great to be with friends when things are going well, but in a personal fight, all your golfing skills are put to the test.
We have to get this message out to all the players and we'll do our best tomorrow.
This time, you need to get away from your peers. Your peers need to do their best".
In contrast to Beyoncé, Jim Furyk wants his players to be more individual than team, with the exception of Jordan Spears and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has had both sides of the story about the fateful final day's outcome: his team in the past led the way on the Brookline, but the European team performed the "Miracle of Medina" and ultimately lost.
When asked about the 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw's call-up for the final day, he said: "I remember one word clearly".
"There are 12 important matches tomorrow, but we expect the same rapid developments we saw in Brookline and Medina to happen early on".
When the momentum comes, there's a lot of pressure in the middle.
We have chosen our strategies according to our circumstances, our intuitions, and tomorrow we will work miracles".
Thomas has been given a promotion and will face top-flight player Rory McIlroy. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face top-ranked European players.
"I put the players in this order because I think I can do better in the whole thing", said Beyonce, explaining the selection of singles.
The new German military, and the postponement of the
The German Navy had planned to upgrade the now-obsolete Cold War-era warship to the latest frigate in 2014, but due to systemic problems and rising costs, the prospect was not realised until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the daily Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman, the launch of the lead ship of the latest Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rhineland-Palatinate, has been extended until the first half of 2019.
The battleship was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014, but problems continued after delivery and the ambitious plans largely went mad.
The Barden-Würtenberg class frigates, which the Navy ordered four in 2007, are to be used in the military to replace the now-obsolete Bremen class frigates.
The Barden-Würtenberg class frigates are characterised by their powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technology such as low-level radar, infrared signals and sonic signals.
Other important features include the long maintenance cycle. It is possible to send a frigate to a location far from the home port for up to two years.
However, the newspaper Die Zeit notes that the latest warships, which are expected to play a key role in Germany's military demonstration abroad, will be obsolete by the time they actually enter service, as plans are being delayed.
The troubled F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to start and turned it over to Brom-Un-Foss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a warship to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Details of the reasons behind the return are unclear, but German media have cited multiple reports of serious "software and structural defects" that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
The software flaws are particularly serious, as the Barden-Würtenberg class frigates are operated by about 120 sailors, half the manpower required for the previous generation of the Bremen class.
The Barden-Würtenberg class frigates are also very heavy, which will reduce performance and limit the future upgrades the Navy can make.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is said to weigh twice as much as the German ships of the same class used in World War II.
In addition to structural flaws, the overall cost of the project, including crew training, is also a problem.
The total cost of the project is estimated to have swelled from 22 thousand euros to 31 thousand euros.
Recent warnings have been issued that the German Navy is weakening, and the issue of this new frigate is of great importance.
Since the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Berthelz, the German parliament's defense minister, has admitted that the navy is actually "lacking warships with enough capacity to deploy".
The Chairman said that the problem is worsening over time, as the use of old warships is being discontinued and there are no replacement warships.
The Chairman also expressed regret at the fact that the Barden-Würtenberg class frigates were not being introduced into the Navy at all.
The National Trust, the mystery of the bat.
A new study being conducted at sites in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use terrain to prey.
The study is expected to provide new information about the behaviour of this unique flying mammal and contribute to future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland, tracks common bat species such as Sopranopipistrel, Brown-eyed and Doverton in the Inverveggarden in Westeros.
Special recorders are installed at key points in the site and monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out mobile surveys using mobile detectors.
All the recorded sounds are analyzed by experts, along with the frequency of calls made by the bat, to reveal which species are doing what.
Based on the analysis, a habitat map and report will be produced, and the behavior of the bats will be described in detail according to the terrain.
Rob Duver, conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes the study will reveal where the most important habitats for bats are and how they are used by various groups.
This information can help to determine the merits of habitat management, such as how to establish habitat or forest protection for bats and related species.
In Scotland and throughout England, the bat population has declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
The bat is threatened with extinction by construction and habitat loss that affect the condition of the poplar trees.
In addition to the chemical treatment of paper and building materials for insect control, attacks from pet cats, and windmills and lighting pose a risk to bats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, bats are nocturnal and have a habit of relying on hearing rather than sight for their prey activities.
The bat uses its advanced reflex positioning capabilities to pick up insects at pin points and identify obstacles in flight routes.
The NTS, which manages 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and more than 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taking the bat very seriously.
The NTS has 10 experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect bat nests and sometimes protect bats.
The NTS has also established the first bat sanctuary in Scotland at the Sleeve Estate at Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the land is an ideal habitat for bats.
"This sleeve is the best place for bats", he says.
"There are old buildings here, and there are a lot of old trees, and they're all part of a suitable habitat for bats.
But there's so much more that bats don't know, that what we're doing here and elsewhere can help us understand what it takes to breed".
He said it is important to identify bats before undertaking conservation work on the land, as accidentally destroying even one tree where bats are breeding could kill up to 400 female and young bats and could lead to the extinction of bats on the land.
Bats are designated as protected animals and it is illegal to kill, abuse, interfere with or cut down any trees.
Elizabeth Ferrell, chair of the Scottish branch of the Bat Conservation Trust, is asking for support from the local community.
"There is still a lot to learn about the Scottish bat, and we really don't know how they behave", he said.
Ronald denies rape charges, and his lawyer is ready to sue.
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the allegations of rape against him as "false" and says that the accuser is using his name "just to promote themselves".
Mr. Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the suspicions.
The Portuguese forward for Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathleen Mayorca in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
De Spiegel reported Friday that Mr. Ronald is also suspected of handing the woman $375,000 and asking for a tip to make it look like this was not the case.
Hours after the news was reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the report "fake news" to his 142 million followers via a live video on Instagram.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what is that is the way to do this is the way to do this is the way to do this is to this is to this is to this.
"The content the magazine reported today is fake news", Ronaldo, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera:
"They want to promote themselves under my name".
It's not uncommon.
They want to use my name to promote their magazine. That's their job.
"I'm fine, no problem at all", he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Mr. Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Mr. De Spiegel over the allegations, criticizing the magazine for "unforgivably reporting speculation in the area of privacy".
According to lawyer Christian Schultz, Mr. Ronaldo is "probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years, demanding compensation commensurate with the severity of the violation".
The whirlwind incident is said to have occurred in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada, Mr. Ronaldo and Mayorca went to Mr. Ronaldo's room after meeting at a nightclub, where he allegedly raped Mayorca's cheek.
Mayorca says that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the incident and said he was "99%" a "good person" and was deceived by the "bad 1%".
According to the document, Mr. Ronaldo admits that there was a sexual relationship between the two, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and had her wounds photographed in the hospital, but later she sought an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and fear of being "publicly humiliated".
Mayorga, 34, is now demanding the settlement be withdrawn because of the ongoing trauma of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the midst of a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the incident, and this summer he is transferring to the Italian giant Juventus for a thousand euros.
Brexit will "regret forever" the loss of the car industry.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said Britain would "regret forever" losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer by Brexit.
The minister also said he was "concerned" that British Toyota had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt production at its Barnaston plant.
Clark, the business secretary, said "agreement is needed".
The Japanese automaker says that if Brexit goes through without an agreement, delays at the border will lead to losses in business.
Toyota's Barnaston plant produces the Auris and Aventis, and 90% of the 150,000 cars produced last year were exported to countries outside the UK and the European Union.
Marvin Cook, Toyota's Barnaston plant manager, said: "If the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, manufacturing at the plant will stop".
Honda, BMW, Jaguar Rover and other UK carmakers are also concerned about leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border deals.
For example, BMW is closing its "mini" factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of carmakers is the supply chain risks of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a 'just in time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made vehicles.
According to the car industry, if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could lead to delays at the border and delays or shortages of parts.
Toyota says it is impossible to keep stock for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so production will stop.
Clarke said that the "Checker Plan" presented by Prime Minister May for the future relationship with the EU was "sophisticated enough to avoid border checks that the industry is concerned about".
"We need a consensus, which means we want the best possible consensus not only to enjoy the current success but also to make this an opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"What Toyota and other manufacturers are showing is that we need to be able to keep the supply chain that has been so well functioning so far fully intact".
Toyota has not said how long it will be shut down, but it says the additional costs will reduce factory competitiveness and eventually affect employment in the long run.
Peter Tsoubalis, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is the union representative at the factory, said that there is growing concern among union members: "In my experience, if these jobs are gone, there will be no more jobs".
A government spokesman said: 'The government has presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.'
"Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be rescheduled". White House.
The White House announced Sunday that the scheduled high-level meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein could be delayed "for another week" because of the ongoing dispute over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump's close ties to Russia, and the president's obstruction of justice.
The question of whether President Trump's change of deputy attorney general will affect Mora's independence has been the focus of attention around Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had attended a meeting wearing a device to record conversations with President Trump, suggesting the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, where he reportedly announced his intention to resign.
In response, it was announced that a meeting with President Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, would take place on Thursday.
President Trump said he "wouldn't want" to replace Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting with him was postponed because of a meeting scheduled to coincide with a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee. During the hearing, both Dr. Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Bligey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of the abusive behavior, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, and the Senate vote will be delayed even further.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said in an interview with Fox News on Saturday:
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The schedule is not over yet. It could be this week. With everything else going on at the Supreme Court, it's not crazy if it's postponed by a week.
That's going to be clear in the future, and I always want to keep the latest information in my press release".
Some reporters will disagree with that statement: Mr. Sanders hasn't been to a White House press briefing since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings does not mean that she hates the "stand-up" of TV reporters, but she also said that "they are not denying that they are playing stand-up".
The report suggests that there will be more opportunities for direct contact between Mr. Trump and the press.
"President Trump has said that he spends more time answering questions than any other president", but he did not provide evidence: "We have confirmed the number".
The briefing will continue, but Sanders said, "If the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's definitely better than asking me".
"We are working hard to make this happen, and you know we have been working on a lot of things over the last few weeks, and if we can get a chance to talk to the president of the United States, it will be a replacement for press briefings".
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House for public receptions and press conferences.
However, one-on-one press conferences are rare.
The reason is evident in the president's nature, who has been speaking freely in New York this week and sometimes making unnatural appearances in front of gathered reporters.
A letter to the Health and Safety Minister and NHS workers in Scotland who are worried about Brexit
The Health and Safety Minister expressed his country's gratitude to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland and his intention to keep them in the same position after Brexit.
Six months before the UK leaves the EU, MSP Jean Freima has released a letter:
The Scottish Government has pledged to provide EU citizens already working in government-developed public services with something that matches the costs of applying for settlement.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU have been negotiating a postponement of the withdrawal this summer, but it is expected to reach a conclusion this autumn.
But the UK government is also considering the possibility of a Nordic scenario and is preparing for it.
I'm sure this is a very uncomfortable time for you.
So, I repeat, I think the contribution of all staff, regardless of nationality, is very valuable.
Our colleagues from across the EU and other countries are bringing valuable experience and technology to improve the functioning of health services and contribute to the patients and communities we serve.
I hope that Scotland will be your home and that you will remain here.
Christian Abbakronby, head injury and emergency surgery.
Tennessee Tiger linebacker Christian Abbaklombby suffered a head injury and underwent emergency surgery in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
According to Tennessee head coach Rod Reed, the injury is believed to have occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there", says Reed.
The coach and medical staff performed oxygen inhalation on the sideline before putting the avatars on the stretcher and transporting them to the stretcher for further examination.
A Tennessee state spokesperson told WSMV's Chris Harris that the avaklombist had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris added that "we don't know the details of the type/severity of the injuries yet". He said that Tennessee is beginning an investigation into when the injuries occurred.
For the Redshirt sophomore, this was his first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five tackles before being dropped from the game, making him 18th in the season.
The tax on stamp duty paid by foreign buyers of UK property.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying UK property. The proceeds will be used for homeless support under the newly devised Tory Plan.
Mr Corbyn has succeeded in attracting young voters, but this move is expected to counter this.
The stamp duty increase is aimed at people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Revenue Agency expects to generate revenues of up to £120 million a year, which will be matched by homeless support.
Prime Minister Theresa May today announced that foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying UK property, with proceeds going towards homelessness support.
Jeremy Corbyn has succeeded in getting young votes, but the move is seen as an attempt to counter his forces by promising to increase the supply of cheap housing and tax the upper income groups.
The stamp duty increase is imposed on individuals and corporations who do not pay taxes in the UK. The proceeds are used to strengthen the government's measures against street life.
The tax increase will be added to the current stamp duty, which will be increased by up to 3%. Two years ago, increases were introduced for second homes and rental housing.
The Revenue Agency estimates that this will generate £120 million in revenue per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-EU residents, which is driving up house prices and making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to buy homes.
The wealthy areas of the UK, particularly the capital, are becoming "ghost towns" due to the increase in foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy was announced a week after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of taking over land to keep housing prices high and urged Prime Minister May to remove the cap on the number of cheap homes to correct the UK's "housing problem".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of proposals that have attracted attention as housing reform, including curbing rents and ending the "no-go" persecution.
He also wants to give Parliament more power to build new housing.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year, I said that I would work through my role as Prime Minister to rebuild the British Dream, and that the lives of the new generations should be better.
It's also about fixing our country's broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not a good situation for non-resident individuals and foreign companies to be able to buy housing easily while UK residents are working hard.
For many people who dream of having a home, this is no longer a distant dream. The dignity of the street-dweller is being ignored and remains too real a problem.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate dream is to be the manager of the Scottish national team".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his "ultimate dream" is to one day manage the Scotland team.
The 42nd Scotland international is trying to revive the North East club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points behind the top-flight.
The same man who led St. Milan to the Scottish Premiership last season has moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I got the B cap, but that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"As a child, I grew up watching my father and the Scottish team in Hamden. It always brought me back.
"This is an opportunity that cannot be had without the success of the club management".
The Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poje and Paolo Di Carneño.
He is also the former manager of Aroa Athletic, and has said he is not afraid to join the big names at such a prestigious club, having been turned down in the past by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now depends on getting this club back into the Premier League.
"The club is a great team, because the organisation and the facilities of this club are, without a doubt, the Premier League itself", he said.
"It's never easy to get there, but unless we get the club back there, it probably won't be successful".
Mr Ross has only been manager for three years, but he has 15 months' experience as assistant manager at Dumbarton and as a coaching staff member at Hearts.
He then helped Alora back from relegation to the third tier and led the next season's relegation-bound St. Milan to the championship title.
Ross says he is more at ease now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Milan and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point in my life", says Alora, looking back on the time she received it.
"I really thought management was more interested in me than players.
I was doing well as a player, and this may seem strange, but I was making some money and I was doing some good.
But playing is hard.
There's a lot to do every week.
And it's the same in terms of stress and pressure, but it's like management is looking at you.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and I'm doing it now. I've never been this alone since I was an adult".
The preview of the interview will be broadcast on Radio Scotland's Sports Sound on 30 September at 12:00 and 13:00 UK time.
Research has shown that the best time to drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The UK pubs are struggling to operate, but sales are being delayed by the summer heat. For restaurant chains, this is yet another burden.
According to the survey, sales in July increased by 2.7% in pubs and fell by 4.8% in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA, who summarised the findings, said: 'The sunshine continued and Britain struggled at the World Cup longer than expected, so July was roughly the same as June. The pubs grew by 2.8%, but it was another blow for the restaurants.
The restaurant business declined by 1.8% in June, but it was even more severe in July.
In comparison with the same period last year, pubs and bars, which mainly serve drinks, are the best performing in Dantzet. This is larger than the reduction in the number of restaurants.
The pubs, which are the main foodstuffs, are not as much a restaurant business, but they are suffering from the intensity of the sun.
I'm sure people are going out for drinks.
"The number of drinks sold in the pubs and bars of the management is up 6.6% compared to the previous month, but the number of meals sold is down 3%".
Paul Newman, a leisure hospitality analyst at RSM, says: 'These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large social/sports events are major factors in the sales of the outdoor food industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant group is still struggling, but it is particularly painful that sales have fallen by 4.8% compared to the same period last year, with cost pressures persisting.
The long summer heat has come at a much worse time for food-heavy businesses. It will soon become clear whether the cooling of the temperatures since August will bring the much-awaited relief.
July sales, including new openings, rose by 2.7% across pubs and restaurants, reflecting a slowdown in the brand's expansion.
Kaffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collecting and analysing performance data from 47 management groups. The association has a total turnover of £9 billion and is a leading benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a social media account that they don't tell their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children kept a social media account hidden from their parents or teachers, including children as young as 11 years old.
The survey was conducted on 20,000 middle school students and found that "fake Instagram" pages are increasing.
This news has raised the risk of sexual content being posted.
20% of students are said to have "main" accounts to show their parents.
One in five children create social media accounts in secret from adults, including children as young as 11 years old.
The survey of 20,000 middle school students found a surge in fake Instagram pages, which is a portmanteau of Instagram and Instagram.
This news has raised the risk of sexual content being posted.
It is estimated that 20% of students have both a "main" account and a "secret" account to show parents that they have removed unwanted content.
One mother accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, who posted "rape" to others.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Conference (HMC), found that 40% of pupils aged 11-18 had two profiles, one of which was a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Butchman said: "We are shocked to see so many teenagers wanting to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find".
Eli Doyle, the Scottish Athletic Commission's "voice of the athlete".
Athlete Ellie Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the Scottish Athletic Commission's general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty said the decision was a good opportunity for those in the sporting world to draw on her extensive experience over the past decade at the international level.
"Aly is held in high regard by the Scottish, UK and global athletic community and we are confident that her election to the board will be a huge benefit to Scottish athletics", he said.
Doyle said: "I want to take the sport seriously and to be able to give a voice to the sport and to contribute to the sport and to the fight in Scotland".
An American man who has won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Athens Olympics and now appears regularly as a BBC expert, has suffered a stroke and is unable to walk.
He tweeted: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctor told me that it was only a matter of time before he would recover.
It was a very difficult journey, but I'm completely recovered and I can walk again.
Thank you for your encouraging message!"
And the ads for the milk machine that made her look like a cow.
The milk machine manufacturer has published an advertisement that portrays a milk cow suckling its mother, and online opinion is divided.
Elby, a consumer technology company, released an advertisement inspired by a comic music video for the launch of the world's first silent wearable suckler. The intent of the advertisement was to depict the liberation of a breastfeeding mother by the new suckler.
Four real mothers dancing in a cowshed with their cattle packed in, singing songs that include the following: "I'm breastfeeding myself. But there's no tail". "I may not have noticed, but it's not cow's milk, it's my milk".
The chorus continues: "I suckle, suckle, suckle it to the baby; suckle, suckle, suckle I the human woman".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversy online.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments. Viewers' reactions were mixed. Many of them said the ad exposed the dairy industry to "fear" in broad daylight.
"It is a gross misjudgment to use dairy cows in the advertising of this product.
Like us, dairy cows must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk. The difference is that cows are separated from their babies within a few days of giving birth.
The Elby's suckler fits in the breast milk bottle.
Other comments state: "Of course, this is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
Why would a human mother use a cow when she can't have her baby taken away from her?"
"It's an incredible advertisement", one adds.
Some people defend this ad. One woman says the song "made me laugh".
"I think it was a brilliant idea.
I think I'll use it myself if I'm still breastfeeding.
I'm really like a cow when I suck milk.
I'm convinced the ads are a little crazy.
Some people said, "This is a great product".
Others commented: "This is a fun ad for moms who are breastfeeding and think they look like cows (often in the workplace or toilet)".
It's not an ad that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the dancing women reveal that they had hidden the pump in the brazier.
The concept of the campaign is inspired by the fact that many women who breastfeed say they are like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and fits in a breast-feeding bracelet so that women can move freely, hold the baby, or even go outside while breast-feeding.
Mother's partner and ECD's Ana Baralin says: "The Elvie Pump is an innovative product, so I think it was a good idea to have a bold and stimulating sales pitch.
The aim of the comparison between the feminine representation and the milk cow was to draw attention to the problems of breastfeeding and to show in a funny way the surprisingly free feeling of the new breastfeeding.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two who used this product appeared on the runway with designer Marta Jacobowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children were smuggled into tent camps on the Texas border.
While the number of crossings in a month has remained relatively unchanged, the number of detained immigrant children has increased sharply, partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to entrust children to guardians.
Until now, most guarantors have been illegal immigrants themselves, who feared they would risk their own stay by filing for their children.
The risk was increased when federal authorities announced in June that guarantors and other adults in their families would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Alvens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had filed for unaccompanied minors.
The same agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the persons who are guarantors or members of the guarantor's family are in the country illegally, and the majority of them are foreigners with criminal records.
"We are continuing to track such individuals", Alvens said.
According to camp workers, in order to process the children's applications quickly, the authorities introduced new rules requiring them to appear within a month, rather than 60 days after detention, as was the norm.
Many will appear in court instead of in person, via video call, and make a legal status claim to the Immigration Judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for rescue shall be immediately deported.
According to reports from camp workers and inmates over the past few months, prolonged detention makes children more susceptible to anxiety and depression, and as a result, to violence and escape attempts.
Advocates said there was growing concern that large institutions such as Torneo, due to their size, were missing signs that children were facing difficulties.
He added that moving a child to a tent without being emotionally prepared or giving them enough time to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma they are already suffering.
Syria has ordered the US "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Muareem called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite the war in the country entering its eighth year.
Deputy Prime Minister Muammar al-Assad said foreign forces were illegally stationed on Syrian soil, citing the fight against terrorism, and said they would "respond accordingly".
"We must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he said at the meeting.
Muallem claimed that since 2011, the "war on terror is almost over", with 360,000 people dead and millions displaced.
Syria said it would continue its holy war until "terrorist groups and illegal aliens" were "cleansed from all over Syria".
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and instruction of the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are in conflict with President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mulem accuses "some Western countries" of "spreading an irrational fear" that refugees should stay abroad, although he has no problem with the conditions of return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage the return", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
The UN diplomat said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last important rebel base in Idlib created an opportunity to advance political dialogue.
Russia and Turkey agreed to avert a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to 3 million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and that the military action will target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters with links to al-Qaeda, "who aim to eradicate" them.
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members early, draft a post-war Syrian constitution and hold elections.
Muallem offered the Syrian government conditions for joining the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is re-elected.
According to that logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless he is disrupted early as president by impeachment and scandal, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
It will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential finale ever".
So far, there's no sign of the audience getting bored.
Since 2014, Golden Hour viewership has more than doubled at CNN by 1.05 million, and at MSNBC by 1.6 million, nearly tripling.
According to Nielsen, Fox News' Golden Hour averaged 1.7 million viewers a year ago to 2.4 million, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" had the highest 3.5 million viewers of any cable channel's nighttime mainstream news program.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, and it's not understandable", says Neil Baer, the host of the ABC drama "Survivor: The Fate of the President", which stars the cabinet minister who became president after the capital was destroyed in the attack.
Veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, Nell Scobel, has a different view.
She remembers getting in a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.

She asked why.
"The driver said 'because he makes you laugh.' " Scobel told me.
Confusion has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the story line from the American government will determine the future of the Law v. Wade trial, whether immigrant families will be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury given only to the most privileged viewers.
Yet, when we watch a panel of experts debate the impact of the use of "deep background" in Bob Woodward's book FEAR, Paul Manafort's $15,000 dacha bomber jacket, and Storm Daniels's anatomically rigid explanation of Trump, we are beyond the informed public.
Personally, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what makes him feel like a reality show is that he's giving you something to talk about every day", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Pawn Stars, about the cast and the day-to-day script of Trump's show (which takes place during the NFL fight and praises Kim Jong-un).
We can't miss the forgotten episode.
When I contacted Mr. Freese this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, and he was recording CNN in his house and watching MSNBC.
He couldn't leave, with Brett Kavanaugh testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court uncertain.
"When I used to do crazy shows, people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Freese told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but I found it was true".

The next midterm elections are expected to be financed by outside sources.
It's no surprise that the money is flowing into Pennsylvania's 17th District, where two incumbents are vying for the same seat, due to congressional redistricting.
The newly reorganized Pittsburgh suburban district is currently represented by Democrat Conor Lamm, who won a separate district seat in a special election last spring.
The candidate running against Mr. Lam is Republican Keith Rothfuss of the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps substantially with the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old district was unlawfully favouring the Republicans, and the district was reorganized.
The new 17th District election campaign is a fierce battle that has drawn funding from the Democratic-Farmer-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Conservative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative-Cervative
Mr. Lam won the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which drew attention, and made his name known in Pennsylvania.
That seat was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators say the Democrats are slightly in the lead.
The United States withdrew sanctions after considering El Salvador, a neighboring country of China.
The diplomat noted that, with little opposition from the United States, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized China.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Barrera in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until they both withdrew the Trump campaign management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decision to suspend recognition of Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered in El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug addiction, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, were painful for the Central American country, which is plagued by high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal discussions progressed, North and Central American officials postponed high-level talks focused on security and economic development, following a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of immigrants into the United States.
However, by mid-September, government officials had made it clear that they wanted to continue the meeting, and they had effectively concluded their consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the mid-October parliament on imports, which the government is seeking to discuss at the meeting, the diplomat said.
Without any new harsh messages or sanctions from the United States, three special envoys have returned secretly from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on details of what the three senior U.S. officials discussed, two of whom have agreed to speak on condition of anonymity about what they have considered internally.
These explanations were confirmed by an outside analyst, a government source who spoke on condition of anonymity:
The history of the investigation.
The next possible hand in the pursuit is the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the potential for obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump. This public record contains very significant evidence.
According to reports, Mueller is looking into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in targeting the US election.
If the Congress changes, Trump will be accountable to the majority party and even the congressional jury as he prepares for his re-election campaign.
That doesn't necessarily mean that Trump or a European leader will lose his job, although there are many assumptions.
The choice that will determine how long the difficulties last must be made on both sides of the Atlantic.
If the West resisted Hitler and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler in 1938.
They failed and missed the chance to avoid the massacre that followed for many years.
History can turn such turning points into frontiers, and the rigorous progress of democracy can be accelerated or hindered.
The American people are facing several turning points:
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Mr. Rosenstein, who suggested he had secretly recorded the president last year and speculated that the president was unfit for office, had been in trouble since the story was published.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times article is inaccurate.
"How would you react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Mr. Brett Cavanaugh was not complete or fair, or if the Supreme Court upheld him despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
More importantly, will we vote in a midterm congressional election that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But I think I'll learn a lesson from Prague and I won't fail.

Graham Drans of the Rangers, fast, confident in the victory.
Rangers will face Rapid Wien at home on Thursday. A spectacular draw at Bijello in Spain earlier this month, and a win over the Austrian team, will increase their chances of breaking into Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Drans was out of action this season due to a knee injury, which kept him out of the game until the second leg, but he believes Rangers can take the next step from that.
"Visual is a good team, so it's good that we scored points", said the 31-year-old.
"We believed we could score at least one point when we entered the game.
Perhaps the last sentence was well said, but overall the result would be fair.
I think we had a good first half, but we played well in the second half and we were in the lead.
Thursday night is the big game in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because the opposing team had a good result in the previous game. But I believe that with the support of the fans, we can work hard and get a good result.
Last year was definitely a tough year, with my injuries and changes at the club, but I feel at home now.
The team is great, the teammates are having a lot of fun, the training is great.
From now on, I'm going to forget about last season and try to make it work.
And that's what I'm talking about.
Despite the fact that the respondents have a clear idea of what kind of care they want, few people talk about their families and their concerns.
In a national survey, about half of the respondents said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them talk to their kids about it.
"People want their families to take care of them, but they don't really have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
I'll show you how to start the conversation.
Talk to your spouse and children. You cannot prepare for family care unless you have told them your wishes in advance.
Work with counsellors and family members to discuss where and how to get care. These choices are important factors in determining costs.
I use financial advisors. They can help you think about how to pay for such expenses.
Options for funding long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance to cover expenses or hybrid cash value life insurance to self-finance, where available.
The Commission shall draw up legal documents.
To oversee the healthcare and to appoint a healthcare agent to ensure that the specialist will follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We will also consider the financial mandate.
If you can't do that, choose someone you trust to make financial decisions and ensure payment of your invoices instead.

Police described the shooting, which occurred shortly before 2:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as "an indiscriminate shooting".
The victim did not witness the assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in India
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Par on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Communications are disrupted and rescue officials are unable to obtain information from Dongara prefecture in northern Par, close to the magnitude 7.5 quake site.
In Par, 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are the main facts about Pal and Dongara on the island of Sulawesi.
Pal is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. In 2017, the population was estimated at 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a province that stretches over 300 km along the coastline of the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The prefecture is a smaller administrative district than the state. In 2017, the population was estimated at 299,200.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but is mostly concentrated in the coastal moraine on the other side of the Slavic.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Par and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami, and hundreds of homes in Dongola were destroyed.
West Dongola was also hit by a tsunami in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a volcanic zone around the Pacific Ocean and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: A massive earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December, causing a tsunami that devastated 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A strong earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southernmost part of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the provincial capital of Padang in West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck an island off Sumatra in the Mentawai Islands, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh caused devastating damage, and people panicked after the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: A major earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake, and many tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son is under arrest for domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Trac Palin, has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Police on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance of the woman tried to report the suspected crime to the police, he picked up the woman's phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is being held at the Matsu Pre-trial Facility again, on $500 bail.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and claimed "of course innocent" in response to confirmation of his defence:
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the assault to the police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with domestic violence reporting, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
He claimed his girlfriend was hit in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for associating her son's violence with PSTD due to his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
A major earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, killing 384 people.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks will be cut off and the death toll is expected to rise.
The earthquake occurred in central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video capturing the moment of shock has been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were at the Pearl City Beach Festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal police are seeking the death penalty for a New York City terrorist suspect.
The New York State Police are seeking the death penalty for Cyfro Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a very rare execution for a federal crime that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipoff, 30, used a truck he rented from Home Depot to attack a bicycle path along the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, indiscriminately killing pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalk.
According to a notice of intent to kill filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saipoff "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious injury.
According to court documents, both charges carry the possibility of the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipoff on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, assault and damage to a motor vehicle for acts of intimidation commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases.
The prosecutor said the attack required "adequate planning and foresight" and called Saipov's actions "cruel, cruel and degrading".
"Cyfro Habiljević, Saipoff, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anrol Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Elridge, Arnan Ferrucci, Arnan Diego Mendoza, Alejandro Damian Pagnuko were harmed and the loss to their family and friends was a great loss", the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the death penalty was sought in the Southern District of New York was 10 years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Burns, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 when the couple Julius and Essel Rosenberg, convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviets during the Cold War, were executed.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, had not shown remorse for days and months after the attack.
He said he had no regrets about going to the police, police said.
In the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he had watched ISIS videos on his cell phone and had thought of the attack.
Police also announced that they had requested that ISIS flags be placed in the hospital room:
He also pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of fraud.
David Patton, a member of the federal election team defending Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We do not accept a conviction for life in prison without the possibility of parole, and we believe that the death penalty should only prolong the trauma of such events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipoff's defense had asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP has said that Nigel Farage is the right man to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU.
Nigel Farage declared today that he will "mobilize the People's Army" during protests against the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party needed to feel the "pressure" of euro sceptics when a member of Theresa May's party said he was qualified to negotiate with the EU.
Peter Bourne, a Conservative MP, said that if Mr Farage had been the EU's exit minister, Britain would have left by now.
However, the problem that May faced in reconciling with the divided MPs was that the Conservative remnants of the party participated in the city's protests against leaving the EU.
The Prime Minister has found it difficult to maintain his compromise checker plan amid criticism from the EU's Leave, Remain and EU.
May's supporters claimed that May was trying to reach an agreement with the EU amidst backlash and pressed her to either compromise or "confusion" with eurosceptics and the Labour Party.
Mr. Bohn said at the Solihull "Leave is Leave" rally that "the Checkers want to give up".
He said that Mr Farage should be considered a supporter and put in charge of negotiations with the EU:
"If he was in charge, we'd be leaving already", he said.
The Wellingborough MP said: "I'm in favour of leaving the EU, but the Chequers should stop".
The EU is not going to be subjugated by the war.
We want our own laws in this country.
Mr. Bourne dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people want to reconsider and stay is not true at all".
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative who is in favour of leaving the EU, also attended the rally, telling reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, and the activists who actually walk the streets and bring the election victory are not popular at all within the party.
I want the checkers to step down and ask for their opinion".
In a message to May, he said: "The Prime Minister can remain in office if he has kept his promise".
Farage said that if something betrays the 2016 referendum decision, politicians attending the rally would "feel pressure".
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people and the political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray the EU exit, and we are now saying 'we cannot accept it'".
He sent the following message to an enthusiastic audience: "I want you to feel the pressure of the political class that is trying to betray the EU withdrawal".
"We will not rest until we have mobilized the people's army of this country, which led to the victory of the EU withdrawal, and become a proud Britain that has achieved independence and autonomy".
Meanwhile, the remaining group marched on Birmingham and held a two-hour final rally in the city centre.
This week, after the group was launched, disorganized activists raised a Conservative banner against leaving the EU:
Labour's Baron Adnis mocked the Conservatives over security issues, which were the party's app at the start of the convention.
They were the ones who said we could introduce IT systems and all the technology in Canada to make the border seamless and borderless free trade in Ireland".
"This is a complete hoax.
There is no such thing as a favourable EU exit".
Mr. Warren is preparing for the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "carefully preparing for the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the future Saturday during a discussion rally in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Jeff Diehl, who served as Trump's Massachusetts campaign's vice chairman in 2016.
She's calling attention to her challenge to Trump in 2020.
The event in Holy York on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting of voters since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she would run for president.
Warren said it was time for "women to seek the White House and fix a failed government", and "that includes a woman president".
Arrested in the Sims shooting at Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana Police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that they have arrested 20-year-old Detion Simpson on the 11 a.m. news (ET):
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, seeking information leading to the identification of the man in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed on the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
According to 247sports, "Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wade broke in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to the interrogation that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Station.
Sims, a 198-inch third-year college student from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Team order, Lewis Hamilton wins the title over Sebastian Bettel, and it's almost here.
As Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team order could play a big role in the race.
Bottas, who had a good start from pole position, held on to the lead in the first two laps, almost eliminating Hamilton's chances of winning, and causing Bettel to stage a ranking battle with Hamilton.
Betel pitched first and Hamilton made sure to catch up to the lap-lagging group, but this usually decides the race.
Hamilton, driving a Mercedes, pitched in after one lap and got behind Bettel, but in the third corner, the Ferrari's Bettel, which had blocked two overtakes, managed to take the lead by attacking the empty inside.
Max Belstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh in the first lap.
Then, he cut time and kept the lead for most of the race without changing his tyres to overtake fourth-place Lyconen.
He finally hit the pits on lap 44, but he couldn't get up the pace for the remaining eight laps, and Ryokan came in fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Bartelli was so gentle to let me go first all weekend.
"The team did a great job with a finish or two", said Hamilton.
I'm not going to be able to do this.
President Donald Trump laughed at the claim that Senator Diane Feinstein had not leaked a letter from Christine Breeze Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault at a rally on Saturday.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate showed people were "vile, mean, and lying".
"One of the great things that could happen in the Senate, and has been happening in the last few days, is when you see anger, people who are angry, people who are mean, mean, lying", he said.
"I'm not doing it because of the releases and the leaks.
I'm not doing it".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
You remember her answer, you leaked the documents?
No, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it".
Wait a second.
"We leaked, no, we didn't", he added, with the impression of a senator.
Mr. Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July describing details of the suspicions against Mr. Cavanaugh, which were leaked in early September, but Mr. Feinstein denied that the leak was from his office.
"We have not been hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, nor have we leaked the story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
However, her denial seemed to be out of step with the president's comments at a Saturday night rally: "I think it was too much body language".
"She was probably the worst body language I've ever seen".
In further defending a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president said Democrats were using the suspicion for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take any means necessary.
"You'll see that they're mean, mean, they don't care who they hurt, they don't care who they kick to get power and rule", Mediaite reported the president's comments.

And the air traffic controllers watched the plane take off, and hundreds of people were on board.
Indonesian air traffic controllers are hailed as heroes who died after completing their mission before a plane carrying hundreds of people took off.
A major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
Strong aftershocks continue to occur in the area, with many trapped in the city of Par.
While his colleagues escaped, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan managed to escape from the shaking control tower at the Mutiara Siss Al Jufri airport.
He stayed until he could see Battic Air 6321 take off safely from the runway at the time of the earthquake.
Then I thought the control tower was falling down and jumped.
He died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Selarat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
Helicopters from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, transported him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived.
"We are heartbroken by this news", he added:
Authorities said the death toll could reach 1,000, and the National Disaster Management Agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Bhutan was restricted.
"Many people are still trapped under the wreckage and cannot be rescued, so the number of casualties is likely to increase", said the spokesman for the authorities, Stopo Nugroho.
A tsunami of up to 20 feet (6 meters) has devastated Par. A mass burial is scheduled for Par on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying relief supplies and essential items.
Lisa Kusma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are carrying bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
"Mini markets are being looted everywhere".
Jean Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors in a hurry, but what do you think of this place?"
This is already a tragic situation and it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Par on Sunday and told the army: "I want you to work day and night and complete all the evacuation tasks".
"Are you ready?" CNN reported:
Indonesia: More than 550 people have died in an earthquake in Longbok earlier this year.
A plane crashed on a reef in Micronesia, one person missing, according to Air New Guinea.
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific reef off Micronesia, said all 47 passengers and crew had initially safely evacuated the sinking plane, but one man was missing.
Air New Guinea announced that a male passenger had gone missing as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to confirm the man's whereabouts.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for passenger details such as age and nationality.
The other passengers and crew of the plane that crashed into the sea while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport were rescued by local boats.
Authorities said seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers remained in hospital, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events remain unknown.
Both the airline and the US Navy announced that the plane had crashed into a coral reef just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had entered the airport in low air.
"It was very good", Mr. Jaynes said.
Mr. Jaines said he and others walked through waist-high water to reach the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the cabin crew panicked and cried out, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy announced that the crew, who were also working on the head restore, had used inflatable boats to bring the people back to shore and joined the rescue before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG airline crashes over the past 20 years, but Air New Guinea was not involved.
An analyst describes the time series of the night the woman was burned alive.
In a retrial of a man accused of burning a living Mississippi woman in 2014, prosecutors delivered final arguments Saturday.
Paul Lawlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a reference in the field of intelligence analysis.
He used cell phone records to trace the movements of 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers and 29-year-old defendant Kinton Tallis on the day of her death.
Mr. Lorette said he had received location data from several cell phones indicating that Chambers was with Tris the night she died, which contradicted Tris' previous testimony, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The police went to Sanford to ask about the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, because the cell phone data showed he was with Chambers.
Sanford testified that he was not in town on Saturday.
When the prosecutor asked if it was true that Tallis said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford testified that "he is lying because his truck was in Nashville".
It was also contradictory to say that Tris had been meeting Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to her cell phone records, she only met him a week ago.
Mr. Lawlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' texts, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's wiped her out of his life", said Mr. Hale.
The accused is scheduled to begin his final defense on Sunday.
The judge said later that day that the trial would be moved to jury deliberation.
The High Breed: What is rational hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio is trying to challenge the genre's negative image by putting a positive message in their music.

You black again?
A couple sued a babysitter in New York for firing them after a "racist" text.
A New York babysitter sues the couple for being discriminationally fired after receiving a text message from her mother saying "A black man is here again" and complaining about herself.
The couple called the lawsuit "an act of coercion" and denied being racist.
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed confusion when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, or the name, or the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the
But the text was not from my husband, but from Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, "they were upset" when they realized the situation, and Plasco-Flaxman fired Morris, saying that the African-American babysitter who had left in the past had been expecting Filipinos instead because of the poor quality of the work.
Morris was paid for the day and returned home by Uber.
This time, Morris sued the couple for dismissal and claims $350 a day for six months if they worked in the original planned residence, even though they had no contract.
"I want to tell them, 'Don't do this,'" she told the Post on Friday, adding, 'I know this is discrimination.'"
The couple denied the accusations of being racist and argued that the dismissal was justified because they were afraid they could not trust Morris after she made them feel uncomfortable.
"My wife sent her a text message, but it didn't mean anything".
She's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But, even if it's a mistake, can you trust your child to someone who has behaved so disrespectfully?"
Your newborn baby?
I can't".
Describing the lawsuit as "forced", Plasco said his wife had just two weeks after giving birth to a baby and "it was a very difficult situation".
"Why would you do this to someone in such a difficult situation?
"That's not a good thing", the investment banker added.
While the legal proceedings are going on, court opinion is rapidly spreading, the couple are being denounced on social media and their actions and logic are being battered.
A new letter from Paddington Publishers reveals that there was concern that the talking bear would not be accepted by readers.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine what it would be like to read it for the first time before it is published.
Now, what we know about Paddington is a great success. It's very interesting".
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book, was inspired by the little bear toy and would have been optimistic if he hadn't accepted the job, and that the 60th anniversary of his death last year was "Bittersweet".
Describing Paddington as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man, not one to brag", she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was like his child had accomplished something, and he was proud of it even though he hadn't done anything in particular".
I think that's how my father felt about Paddington's success.
It was his creation and his imagination, but he always praised Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where she was treated by a doctor with little hope.
"She was in very dangerous condition and Nado had been calling several times to tell her that she was unlikely to be saved", said Ednan LaPeleuse.
"And then Nad called and said, 'She's gonna be dead in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye.'
And I told him.
"I love you so much, sweetie".
I'll be right with you.
I'll be right there.
The medication the doctor gave her to keep her heart from stopping was slowly removed and her movements stopped.
She's already dead and all this has stopped.
I just sat there and waited, knowing everything was happening.
I was surrounded by so many family members and people that I couldn't cry or scream or cry.
I had to endure it with all my heart".
In the midst of his deep grief over the loss of his daughter, Ednan Raphaelouz was eventually forced to take a plane with the other passengers and endure the situation.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was down in tears, with my head down,
It's hard to explain, but it was on this flight that I felt this unbearable sadness for Nad.
What he needed was my love and understanding.
He really loved her".
Sad women put cards on bridges to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent attempted suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries continue to hang cards on the Wales Bridge with heartfelt messages and phone numbers for support.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression at age 13 and took his own life at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, from Lydney, said her son was a smiling, promising chef with a great future.
"Everyone knew his smile.
"Everyone said his smile would brighten any room".
But he was "in a really dark place" and had quit his job before he died.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, discovered his brother's death.
"I'm often worried that something will happen in a chain", Davis said.
Mr. Davis made a card: "Even if you're a friend, you want people to know that you have someone to go and talk to.
Do not be silent - speak".
Humphries, who had been friends with Davis for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say anything about being depressed or having a breakdown", she said.
"We noticed a change in his attitude a few days before Christmas.
He was so depressed on Christmas Day - he didn't look at the kids when they were opening their presents, he didn't do anything".
She said his death was a great trauma for the children, but they had to get over it. "It tore the family apart".
I'm going to break it up.
But we all have to fight with it".

The FBI has launched an investigation into the unpredictable future of Brett Kavanaugh.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was actually asking for with a limited time and scope of investigation, we could get a little bit of unity", said Flake, who was concerned that the committee was "dissolved" during a deep paralysis of partisan sentiment on Saturday.
Why did Mr. Cavner and his Republican supporters not like the FBI investigation?
Their hesitation is all a matter of timing.
The midterm elections are coming up on November 6th, five weeks away, and if, as expected, the Republicans are in a state of disarray, they will be very weak in the selection of the man they want to be elected to the US Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the Senators one after the other and pressured them to support Bush's White House colleague, Mr. Cabano, and his wife, Ashley, who served as Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces that report?
The vote begins in the Senate, which is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Cavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would be enough to break the odds of Vice President Mike Pence confirming him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under Kim.
Since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased, South Korean lawmakers said.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification of Korea, Park Byung-seok said that last year there were 1,127 defectors, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Pak said the main reasons were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates from smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean exiles are gradually granted citizenship in Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the defiant war in 1953.
Many of them are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easily overcome compared to the border that is heavily guarded by the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that lies between South Korea.
China often considers refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and forcibly returns them.
In fact, relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they roughly agreed on a move towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Sunday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho condemned the US sanctions, which have not made any progress since:
"Without trust in the United States, without confidence in our national security, we will not unilaterally go for denuclearization under these circumstances", Li said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for service on the Supreme Court.
Perosi commented in an interview Sunday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas:
"If a woman had taken that attitude, we can't help but think that she would be described as 'hysterical.'" Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about his own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony.
Cabanro emotionally denied the allegations to Dr. Christine Blazy Ford that they had both sexually assaulted her as teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and during his family and high school debates he sometimes tried to scream or shut up.
He also strongly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the allegations against him "a peculiar and coordinated defamation" orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he was convinced that Kavanaugh's testimony had proven that he was unable to serve on the Supreme Court because of his bias against Democrats.
"I think he's unfit for these statements and manners towards Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi expressed his dismay when asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the House Democrats would win a majority.
"Let's just say - if he's not telling the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unqualified in the Supreme Court, but in the courts in which he's currently serving", Pelosi said.
Cabanero is now a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi is a Democrat, and she is concerned that he will be a conservative judge, and that Cabano will dominate the health care reform bill and Roe v. Wade.
At his approval hearing, Cabanero avoided questions about whether he intended to overturn a particular Supreme Court ruling.
"It's not the stage where you go to a courtroom and say, 'Wow, that's great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to practice it.
It is a reasonable, fierce reproach, and months and years of anger are wafted, and she cannot remove it without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry", Mr. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, but what about it?"
She continued: "I was helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also cried when she felt angry, but when she felt angry and started crying, she developed a technique and told the person she was talking to, 'I think I'm crying because I'm sad.'
I'm mad at you".
And she just keeps crying.
And I thought it was so great".
Tears are generally not understood, and are recognized as part of the expression of anger.
One of my most vivid memories of my old job, in a male-dominated office, is of a cold, older woman manager who had been a little afraid of me from day to day, and who was dragged up the stairs by the collar of her neck as I was weeping with an indescribable rage.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're upset".
They think you're sad, and they're happy to disappoint you".
Patricia Schrader, then-Democrat from Colorado, was campaigning for Gary Hart's presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart withdrew from the election after discovering an affair called the Monkey Business, Schrader was so sorry that she thought there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing we needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she was late to start her campaign, and she hadn't raised enough money, she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
I found out that some of her supporters offered her only $250 even though they offered $1,000 to the men.
"They think I've got a discount?" she lamented.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not formally launch a campaign, she was filled with emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, funding and anger at the system that makes it so difficult to target voters rather than representatives, and anger at the disdain for women.
"You must have thought I was a nervous wreck", Schroeder recalled how the press had approached her.
"I thought Clinex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what words would be written on my tombstone.
"What is a weeping worm?"
What is the benefit to Beijing from a Sino-US trade war?
While the trade war between the US and China has begun with a one-off attack and is far from over, experts say that a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump warned earlier this year that he would impose tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest tariffs that have emerged this week are new tariffs affecting the equivalent of 200 billion pounds ($150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the products imported into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way, most recently by imposing a 5 to 10 percent tax on $60 billion worth of American products.
China has vowed to stand up to the United States, and the world's second largest economy is not likely to retreat any time soon.
To yield to Washington means to surrender, but to publicly obey the United States is a great humiliation for China's supreme leader Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing handles its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that early political decisions by Washington or Beijing will create a situation where economic chaos begins in both countries is more dangerous than the bystanders previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the think tank's Center for a New American Security focusing on Asia.
The Syrian Foreign Minister says that we are ready for the return of refugees.
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding the country devastated by seven years of war.
According to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouram said the situation in the country was improving:
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to repair areas destroyed by terrorists towards a return to normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for refugees who have had to flee due to terrorism, economic measures biased towards their daily lives and livelihoods, or who return to their country at will.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their homes since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouram said the Syrian government would welcome support for the reconstruction of the collapsed country:
But he stressed that he could not accept conditional support or support from countries that sponsor civil unrest:
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
At Le Golf National, outside Paris, France, the European Union won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 over the United States.
The United States currently has six consecutive defeats in Europe, and Europe has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe, with Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, regained the crown by scoring 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has been stuck for most of the tournament, drops his tee shot on the 16th hole of the par 3 and concedes his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer, Molinari, has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to aim for the current 5-0-0 format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
Jordan Spears of the United States defeated the lowest ranked player on the European team, Torbjörn Olsen of Denmark, 5-4
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, dropped two and one to England's Ian Poulter, who would have played in the Ryder Cup final.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, is the European champion with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a very difficult year.
So I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and put his faith in me.
I'm so happy. I'm really happy to get the cup back.
"This is a team, and I'm very happy to be able to contribute", he said emotionally after the European victory.
He handed the baton to his fellow American, John Ram, who beat American golfing legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles.
"It's an incredible pride to win against Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all of his matches in France by four and posted a career record of 13-21-3, a Ryder Cup record.
The odd statistic of one of the greatest players ever to win 14 major titles is Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high quality during the tournament, the United States team struggled to find a fairway during the weekend.
The American captain, Jim Froome, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the team. They fought.
We discussed Europe this morning.
We had a fight.
I'd like to pay my respects to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to team up again and work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committees in the United States and move forward.
I love these 12 men very much and am proud to serve as captain.
You'll have to drop your hat.
We were defeated".
Red tide updates: Concentrations are down in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that red tide concentrations are declining on average in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patcher colour conditions have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Coriander populations, indicating decreased concentrations.
The red tide is estimated to extend from northern Pinellas County to approximately 130 miles of the coastline in southern Lee County.
Patches can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but are seen in fewer places than last week.
Red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County or offshore in the past week; low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County offshore; high to high concentrations in Manatee County from confirmed element; high to high concentrations in Sarasota County or offshore from confirmed element; middle to high concentrations in Charlotte County; high to low concentrations in Colia County or offshore from confirmed element.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Coria counties, respiratory infections are being reported.
No respiratory infections have been reported in northwest Florida this week.
