Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid they'll look like fools
Some Members of the National Assembly have been intimidated by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties fear that this could be ridiculous.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that the words twp and pwp were being rhyme-tasted.
For readers outside Wales: twp means "slow" and pwp means "cocktail".
A Welsh Party Member said the party as a whole was dissatisfied and was proposing alternatives.
A Conservative MP said his party was moving to change the name liberally, but noted that the MWP for short is not far from the word muppet (doll).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u.
The Assembly Commission is currently working on a draft law to change the names, which stated: 'The final decision on the possible designation of Assembly members will of course be the responsibility of the Members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public debate on the proposals, which showed that the name change to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
As regards the designation of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name MPs of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but the most support was gained in the public debate by the MWP option.
The Assembly's deputies are obviously trying to propose alternatives, but it can be difficult to reach an agreement, especially for President Elin Jones, who is due to table the amendment bill within weeks.
The reform laws will also include further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules for the exclusion of Members and the draft system of committees.
The assembly's delegates will have the final say on their designation when they discuss the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A popular vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour expresses its claim to Greek territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Dagor Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price a country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church have died due to church problems in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner", Adams says.
There's no one today.
In his opinion, the loss of bars is understandable.
People are socializing differently today, he says.
The bar is no longer a living room where people from the neighborhood meet regularly.
As for the churches, there is a fear that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.
He added that churches could be filled with rented houses, with residential neighborhoods filled with people who would not support the remaining temples in the area.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he says. "The day is coming when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that most people who come to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black-populated metropolis.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building rights were exercised by a black congregation that performed worship nearby.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was the central figure in a boycott of retailers on 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), who refused to hire and support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners had the bell rung as part of the church's restoration plans.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called this bell "the bells of the poor".
The specialist who played the game in July called it "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This is Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who started playing a major bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
Over the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has been the setting for a complex story of architects and suppliers, some brought in by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The diocesan administration, which is made up of world leaders and runs the diocese's administration, wrote in July that it was concerned that the diocese would be delaying the payment of the costs of the diocesan administration, despite the fact that the diocese did not allocate the architects and suppliers hired by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the diocese's conduct.
13-year-old boy hunting lobsters in California, injured by a shark
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while hunting lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hammel said he thought the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but then found out the boy was screaming, "Something bit me!"
Something bit me!
He had a completely torn skull, Hammel said, which he first noticed when he reached the boy.
I told everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to San Diego's Council Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
For investigative and security reasons, authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create cosmetic boulevards in the style of commercial homes to compete with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chain.
This is a significant £2.8bn investment in the UK cosmetics market, which is growing steadily as sales in fashion and household goods are falling. Larger cosmetics streets will be tested in 11 stores across the country as part of the investment.
Cosmetic investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelf space that once belonged to TVs, microwave tubes, and household necessities.
Sainsbury's representatives said they would double their cosmetics range to up to 3,000 products, with the first being Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees product lines will be given more space, with brand-specific seats available, such as those at Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique line of make-up to make most of its products available to vegans, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
The fragrance shop will also test concession sales at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open by the end of the year in Selly Oaks, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops with a variety of goods mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble department stores, and its supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and other than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated hundreds of Argos stores and also integrated several Habitat stores. Both of the stores were acquired by the company two years ago.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to innovate the cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested the joint venture with Boots after 2000, but the merger ended the dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 stores to Celesio three years ago, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain and had a turnover of £125m.
The company stated that the Lloyds chain will play an important role as a wider range of premium brands of skincare products, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, will be added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and style of cosmetic streets to make our customers shop in a more comfortable environment.
We've also invested in special training for colleagues who will be mentored and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements. The impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a major destination in the cosmetics sector, which is an innovation in traditional shopping.
Peter Jones was furious that Holly Willoughby had cancelled her contract for £11 million.
Dragons' star Peter Jones has been furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has terminated an £11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly interior accessories and accessories brand.
The couple's business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Day star Peter Jones by pulling out of a lucrative lifestyle brand deal at the last minute to focus on her own new mega-deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the golden girl of television during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant he would no longer have enough time to devote to their Truly interior accessories and accessories brand.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain and headed to one of her vacation residences.
One source said: "Project Truly was clearly Holly's number one priority.
It was to be her long-term future, to secure it for decades to come.
Her decision to leave all involved was absolutely shocking.
On Tuesday, no one understood what was happening.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlowe headquarters.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, thanks to huge investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home accessories, and the possibility of further delay in launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby proposed the Truly with Capp project in 2016 and Jones (52) became the director in March.
These two couples are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, who is the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on business matters".
A hard conversation and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that awaits him from the media for his remarks, which some will consider an unfit president and will blame him for saying so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous "moderator" voice.
I didn't make any promises.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the initial joint meeting in June in Singapore, and Trump celebrated the first meeting as a major step toward eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean chief diplomat Ri Jong-ho, the world leader, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "proper response" from the US to North Korea's first steps on disarmament.
It noted that the US instead continued to impose sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech before the assembly.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results  end of missile tests, release of hostages and return of the remaining American troops home.
He also advocated the unusual way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to talk as a president, but then there wouldn't be 10,000 people outside trying their best to get in, but instead there would be 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated one of the islands and killed hundreds
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to leave their homes, a nationwide disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it is a bit complicated", said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children has a team to travel to Palma, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in relief work.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country's preparedness for the wrath of nature is pathetic.
Although there are shelters from tsunamis in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The fact that the tsunami warning siren was not being actively used in Pal is likely to have contributed to the high number of casualties.
Even under favorable conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was on Lombok to provide care for earthquake victims is headed to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has built his campaign to improve Indonesia's decaying infrastructure, spending hundreds on roads and railways.
However, the administration of Widod is suffering from a lack of funds and is due to run again next year.
Moreover, Widodo is under pressure from the ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority followers have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
During the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands more were forced to flee their homes, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other crude weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of FC Liverpool has tied away against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a short cut by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate.
You threw the ball to the left and sent the shot to the farthest corner.
His attempt sailed high above the penalty area and headed for the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the impending Cape Arrizabalag into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, get on the ball. Players like Shaq always try to play as much as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw it coming towards Kante, I made one touch, didn't think much about it, and I shot it.
Chelsea led by 1 to 0. In the 25th minute, they were overtaken by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward returned the score to Mate Kovacic before this goal, turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic has made a quick impact in the middle of the field.
Then he sent out a beautiful penetration note that went with Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard outstripped the defenders and ended up at the farthest pole as he shot left to beat Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Baker.
Liverpool are set to face Napoli in the Champions League group stage, with the match starting at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will play Videoton in UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 3pm in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet [6.0 m] high, Sutopo agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palá, with a population of more than 380,000, has filled with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who was stabbed to death
This morning, a murder investigation began after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard something to come forward to testify.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I call on anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who have recorded anything with the on-board camera, to contact us because they can have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and found herself inside the property.
Friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene this afternoon to find out where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police said they are currently informing the victim's family members.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't say anything.
The owners of the apartments are now learning that they will be back inside in a few hours.
They heard one of the officers tell another man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, another van was standing outside.
There were several police officers in the cordon watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by calling Protocol 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of a dispute over the historical writing
Its removal would be a satisfaction for its fanatical Puritan followers like the Taliban having destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell's company, however, called Crick's proposal a failure and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current discussion on the removal of the statues, it was obvious that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell neither ordered nor performed the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The grand realisation of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft is a testament to his 19th-century vision and is part of the history of a personality that many believe still deserves respect.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many to have been perhaps more of a protector of Parliament from outside forces in the late 19th century than he is today, in his case of course, a protector of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate account of the facts is still debated by historians.
But the truth is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique personality who embodies one side of the conflict.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and respect.
A deadly pig stabbed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer attacked and killed a pig in a market in southeastern China.
A man, known only by his nickname Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and blood spilled near a flea market in Liu-Pchan-Shui prefecture, Kuech-Chou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares a vaccine at a hatchery in Si-ning Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Jün-nan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the sidewalk door open.
He said there was a big male pig with a bloody papule in the barn.
According to the report, a court investigation confirmed that this 250-pound duck had stabbed the farmer to death.
"My brother had bloody and broken legs", said a cousin nicknamed Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan came to the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager for the Evening News said the pig was isolated to prevent another person from being attacked while police were gathering evidence on the scene.
Jüan's family and market officials are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although pork attacks on humans are rare, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to be critically injured.
Ten years later, a 200-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor until his wife could scare the animal off.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood appetite can act as a trigger.
They're just playful.
Shantia, they're curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
All we need to do is show them proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to many parts of the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa reached Category 1 hurricane winds of 137 km/h (137 mph) at 5:00 p.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of the Mexican outlet of Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a coral reef has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 25 inches of rainfall on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Tropical moisture then combined with the nearby crust will produce extensive and heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
In some places, 2 to 10 inches of rainfall will fall, causing severe dangerous flooding, flooding of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 millimeters per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, between two and three inches [5.0 to 10.0 cm] of precipitation are expected.
There may be severe flooding, as conditions quickly deteriorate, due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Given the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, with storms bringing strong winds with dust in the air.
A near-shore coral reef in parts of Southern California will cause heavy local rainfall.
More than 13 millimetres of rainfall may fall, which could cause debris flooding and car crumbs to slip on a smaller scale.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during its rainy season.
On Sunday evening and early Monday morning, the scattered rainfall will begin to approach Arizona, and rain will continue to rain on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners States and will last until Wednesday.
A significant fluctuation in temperature throughout the United States is expected in October, as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A prime example of a sharp change in temperature is the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will try again to push and spread the lasting summer heat.
In many parts of the central and eastern United States, warm early October is expected, with temperatures in several areas from the southern highlands to parts of the northeast exceeding 26 degrees Fahrenheit.
It could be 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high likelihood of extreme temperatures in the eastern United States throughout the first half of October.
The audition for Bret Kavanaugh has been watched by more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people on six television networks on Thursday watched the impressive testimony of Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed against Christine Blasey-Ford in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continued, and until Friday, radio and television stations were interrupted for a last-minute spin: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal that allows the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was out there in a drunken state trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the broadcast was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers, as reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company has calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring tracking in offices.
For comparison, a similar number of spectators watch the US football play-off or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose prominent moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long interview, according to Nielsen, the most of any network.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was high even after the hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, shouting at him by protesters as he tried to get in an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes closed and listened to the remorseful remarks that CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one of the women.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
And they said to him, Thou hast great power, but many women are weak.
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator was closed, he said he'd say more at the committee hearing.
All the cable and other networks were still on the air hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on whether to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee within the next week, which the minority Democrats are urging.
Flakea was partly persuaded by interviews with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had a lot of power because it was clear that Republicans wouldn't get enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of playing political games in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused those who criticized her intention to leave the European Union of playing a political game with Britain's future and violating national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which is next to her front page interview, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her plan for a Brexit, which is likened to a ladies' game.
Shot on Wayde Sims: Police arrested suspect Dyton Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect who allegedly shot Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's fight, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, which was reported to the WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson was questioned, police reported that he confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the lawyer's information, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local criminal justice authorities for their violence and justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played basketball for LSU and his father Wayne.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Sims' death.
"You're always afraid of this", Wade said.
The volcano is hurling ash to Mexico City
The ash that rolls from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid the volcano after the crater's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has recorded several noise and tremors.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the glass windows of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police came into contact with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with law enforcement, and thousands more attended parallel demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the Catalan vote to split up society.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by law enforcement, throwing eggs and powdered paint, and the streets that were sometimes crowded with tourists were filled with dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, there were clashes, and the police used the cannon to get the fighters under control.
For several hours, a group of independents who sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the region's independence-seeking region continue a year after Madrid declared the referendum illegal on October 1, but Catalan separatists have celebrated it.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, but the turnout was low as opponents of the vote-shortening boycotted the vote on a large scale.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the continuation of voting in polling stations across the region in violent gatherings.
Independence groups camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would achieve independence.
Last year was one of our best.
My parents were crying because they were lucky to vote, but now we're stuck, she says.
Although Catalonia's independence-seeking political parties won a close (but important) victory in regional elections in December, they are no longer able to continue successfully this year. Many of their most prominent leaders have gone into exile or are awaiting trial for their part in holding a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who films a protest in support of the police by phone, says that politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
"The situation is becoming more tense", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression that the Spanish government is showing us", he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Besides, there could have been a car fire from the bush.
Meng's goal was a 1-0 win for Livingston over Rangers.
Dolly Menga with the first goal for Livingston secured the win
Rookie Livingston shocked the Rangers, leading Steven Gerrard to just his second loss in 18 games since taking over as coach of Ibrox.
Dolly Mengu's attack proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team made it to the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still unbeaten in the Premier League this season, with Hearts leading the side by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his unbeaten streak in the league to six games, and head coach Holt, who fired Kenny Miller last month, has yet to experience the pain of losing.
Livingston burned his chances against the screaming guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, and his directness made the Rangers have no problem.
Scott Robinson made his way through, but his attempt passed through the gate, and Alan Lithgow's finish was then only heading sideways as he slid a slide into Craig Hallett's head at the gate.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that guests could cause problems from standard situations.
And that's exactly how the decisive goal came down.
The Rangers were coming off a straight free kick and Livingston made it through, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to find Mengu, and the one in the middle of the penalty area was scoring.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the ball, but they failed to beat home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's attempt stopped Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow ended another standard position for Livingston next door.
Livingston's sixteen were constantly being driven by the centre and the defence constantly repelled them.
The phenomenal Livingston analysis is
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
This is a phenomenal performance and a Livingstone result.
All the players as one man were exceptional, and on their way up they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of play and the players on the team have hardly changed since returning to the top competition, but Holt deserves great credit for how the team has lifted since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredible, leading a perfectly organized defense while Meng couldn't keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall out of the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Under Gerrard, they played very well on several occasions, but they fared poorly.
They missed the playoffs only once, they've made it past home-field defense, and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it's a raised warning finger.
Erdogan was not only warmly welcomed in Cologne , on the Rhine .
On Saturday (September 29) the leaders of Turkey and Germany shared breakfast in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose over issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, on the Rhine, to open a huge new mosque there.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside Turkey.
Police said that for security reasons they prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters appeared nearby who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents (many of them Kurds) also came forward, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to invite him into the country.
The protests against the guest show a difference of opinion, with some Germans calling him a hero, while others condemning him as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: death of cyclist after collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the cyclist succumbed to his injuries on the spot.
The accident occurred just months after another cyclist was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Childers Street, about a mile (1.5 km) from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police said police were trying to identify the man and inform relatives.
The road is closed, bus traffic is off limits and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riots
Six prison guards were injured in riots at a high-security male prison, the prison report said.
Unrest erupted on Sunday at about 9:30 am British summer time at the Long Lartin British Prison in Worcestershire and continues.
Special Task Force Tornado was called to the scene to control the riots, with eight prisoners responsible, who were able to be split into one wing.
The security team on the scene treated minor facial injuries.
A prison press spokesman said: "We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to deal with the ongoing incident at the British prison Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for their injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in prisons and we want it to be clear that we turn those responsible over to the police and they can get behind bars for longer.
Long Lartin Prison is serving the sentence of more than 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, a report emerged that the prison director had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, an additional anti-bullying unit was called to the prison to put an end to the serious riots, when prisoners attacked guards with billiards bullets.
For Hurricane Rosa, severe flooding threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (those affected by drought can benefit)
Tropical pressure lows in Arizona are an exceptional phenomenon, but they're likely to hit early next week, with the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa heading southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to march directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecasts set for late Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix had had tropical storm or lower pressure status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rain, with up to 15 inches in some places in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, the drop is likely to be 25 to 50 millimeters, exceptionally up to 100 millimeters.
In areas where flooding is not a threat, rain from Rosa can be useful because the area is suffering from drought.
While flooding is a major concern, it is likely to be beneficial as well, as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently experiencing minimal extreme drought, the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa on the mainland will first target the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 155 miles [137 km/h] per hour, is located about 60 miles [620 km] south of the Mexican outlet of Punta Eugenia and is heading north at a speed of 20 miles [19 km/h].
The storm has hit the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and it's losing intensity.
Therefore, when it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday afternoon or evening, it is expected to have the force of a tropical storm.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be large, which means a high risk of flooding.
Between Baja California and northwestern Sonora, total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 millimeters, with some areas as high as 250 millimeters, reported weather.com.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm through Mexico northward until it reaches the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, then moves upward across Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to Rosa or its remnants is the very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring dangerous tidal flooding and flooding to the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys aged between 17 and 18 and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found stabbed in Somerset.
A wounded boy was found Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 am British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are asking anyone who recorded the incident on their cell phone to come forward to testify.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said before a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered from the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting the accusation that Christine Blasey-Ford sexually assaulted her as a teenager decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing in connection with the allegation.
The President said Saturday that the American people had the opportunity to see the uniqueness, character and courage of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most respected legal experts of our time and a lawyer with a perfect record of public service", he told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
There are five weeks left until the elections, which are among the most important in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running, he said.
That's why I'm doing my best to support exceptional candidates.
Trump has said the Democrats' goal is to "confront and prevent".
The first key procedural vote on the floor of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be on the program by Friday, a senior Republican leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, with casualties rising
At least 384 people died and many were swept away by waves as massive waves from a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paulo on Friday evening when waves up to six meters high hit the coast, destroying everything in their path, and many people came alive.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still engaged in their beach activities, and they did not immediately escape and became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB), at a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, trams, houses, it hit everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people who tried to escape the tsunami climbed a tree and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the quakes continued in this coastal town.
Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong Friday earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The Agency reported that the tsunami intensity could have increased the location of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial homes and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, which is 300 km off the coast north of Palau, because the area is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication was completely crippled and no information from Donggala was available, Nugroho said.
More than 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement.
"It's a tragedy now, but it could be much worse", he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palau, but officials said the waves had arrived just in time for the warning.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings to people down the street that a tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall that carried buildings and cars ran aground on the coast.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communication with the city of Palo and surrounding areas, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes to the scene from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees continued to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened to aid-only flights and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala have made it safely to Pal, where employees hide in sailing shelters built in the office yard, they have been walking through the destroyed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups took on the difficult task of rebuilding after the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to visit Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and workers from other countries can only start arriving if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It is still a provincial disaster,' said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Only when the government says it's a national disaster can we open the door to international aid.
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palau, the families and friends of the missing were hoping that their closest loved ones would be the miracle in the grim story of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewer Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who was trapped in the wreckage with her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, coached two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I've been involved in paragliding for a long time, so I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Subandono described how hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse swept across the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to competitors in Palos attending the beach festival.
However, his reports only showed one grey mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a cash machine in the Newport on the Levee area.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling out an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at this amusement complex and was about to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported.
While he was busy, another man ran behind the back of a Brink's worker and stole a bag of money to put in.
Witnesses reportedly spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many perpetrators were involved.
If you have any information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled the show for emotional reasons.
Besides being a shortened form of his current stage name, West has stated in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means ty (in English, cog.), West said this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "one", is the only word that comes from Ye. It reflects the good, the bad, the confused, everything about us.
The album more reflects who we are.
He's another of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced he's preferring the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also appears with a linker and no linker and in upper and lower case.
The Mexican president has solemnly pledged not to use the military against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has solemnly pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student vengeance.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza promised never, under any circumstances, to use the military to defeat the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at peaceful protesters in this square, killing up to 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are causing young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and promoter Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after various U.S. government entities have expressed their views on artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have a general formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
On the contrary, China unveiled its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation.
"As all other countries are far behind the US and we are working on another breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI), a double budget for AI would be a good start", Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances of another big success coming to the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's leading UI-focused companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an UI system that beat the top-rated American player named Othello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and general manager of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee responded to previous US state technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place to help uncover future visionaries.
As Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"We're not being approved by China for academic leaders, but by big corporations", Lee added.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies in recent years have hired the best brains from universities to work for them on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help support the US in the UI area.
"I think that holders of a PhD in AI should be automatically offered a green card", he said.
The Chinese State Committee published its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage partners from the industrial and academic community.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
On the contrary, the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments drafted an agreement in June that included a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the minimum turnout of 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO by recognising the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price that stands for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, being admitted to communities such as the EU and NATO.
'I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijeva, 79, of Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and decide on the outcome.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has declared that no irregularities have occurred during the referendum until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
'I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,' said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian MP, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko, presented their ballots in the Macedonian referendum on the name change of the country that would allow it to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by opposition parties who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads up, not our backs", Kavadarkov said.
We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
'I am confident that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after submitting his ballot.
He added that the resulting yes would be a confirmation of our future.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said that 30 to 43 percent of voters were preparing to vote  which is below the threshold of participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those polled, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City is outscoring all of Brighton's defenses and scoring.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguer's elegant 65th-minute goal looked ridiculously easy at first glance.
The Argentine striker took a midfield cut at the start of the action.
He's been crawling between three Brighton defenders and running into an open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender and then passed several others on the edge of Brighton's block.
He sent a snippet to the left where Sterling found the ball.
The English striker first touched the ball and sent it back to Aguer, who bypassed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot to the right side of the net.
"Aguera has some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We were talking about him playing for about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave Cityzen the initial lead in the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got to the ball deep in the Brighton area in this game.
He sent a beautiful clip along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
San touched the balls a couple times and led Sterling towards a distant meadow.
Cityzens' attacker hit the ball into the net just before she crashed into the car.
City are set to play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to blow the Rockies ' chances .
When the Nationals missed the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force themselves into the next start.
But extremely competitive Scherzer hopes to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if that still has consequences for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have at least kept their wild card chance, but they still have to confirm their first division title.
Even if we're not losing anything, at least we can still get on the field with the idea that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with the crowd and the opponents, that's probably the highest level we're going to get this year.
Of course I want to experience it.
The Nationals haven't announced their first pitcher for Sunday yet, but they're probably gonna let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make it his 34th start, would have started the bullpen Thursday and would have played Sunday, when he usually has a day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly pointed to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we've accomplished will be at stake.
We've got five weeks until the most important elections of our lives.
It's a huge, huge opportunity, and even though I'm not running myself, I'm actually running, so I'm going up and down the country and fighting for our great candidates, he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats.
They are determined to reclaim power by any means, malice and malice.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to dominate to gain power and control.
The Democrats, he said, went on a mission to oppose and hinder.
"You can see it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, mean and lying.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, named after Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, was met with a loud outcry from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
You let the document slip?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, her body language was really bad, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer liberal.
They don't tolerate people expressing their opinions
When Momentum activists voted in favor of my rebuke, I was barely surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a number of Labour MPs who've been told he's no longer welcome, all for expressing an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure drive criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar issues that Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders on.
The invitation to the Labour meeting outside Nottingham on Friday said that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
After most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday evening GC meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not held in this tone, and the promise of a more gentle, gentler policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated by the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took over, because colleagues I previously thought had a similar political stance on, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and accept views I would never have otherwise agreed with  whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly, and it's basically the same thing I say, there's a barrage of social media criticism calling for impeachment, giving up politics on Wednesday, and hearing that I shouldn't be on the Labour side.
And this isn't just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a mass of sexist or racist attacks every day and never hide from it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how much the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the famous liberals, and with every attempt to express disbelief or change the selection rules, the party is getting tighter and tighter.
For the past two years, a lot of people have been advising me not to get too out of the crowd, to keep quiet and keep my pace, and then I'll be okay.
But that's not what I was getting into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the Thatcher government's indifference to allow my high school classroom to literally collapse, I have been pushing for better public services for those who needed it most, whether in the local council or in the ministry.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative on Friday, I would like to say only that as the country slips towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy to address my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not from Momentum in Nottingham, but it's for the people of my district, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to have been able to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of impeachment or political calculation will deter me from trying to promote what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr reaching the top
Two later attempts may have been a bit of a surprise to the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly entertaining match of the Tennent's Premiership day.
He's now at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the victory brought home a great defense, as well as a better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be happy.
"We've been tested a lot during games and we're undefeated, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Hats off to Ayr, they took a chance better than us".
Thanks to Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to change Frazier's climate, Ayr took the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count and Jason Baggot scored an unchanged try.
Climo took Ayr's lead with a penalty and then, just in halftime, scored a solo try, allowing Ayr to go on a 17-5 break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
A long delay followed due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was suspended, and as soon as the game began Ayr moved on to lead Stafford McDowall's attempt to change the Clima.
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose used it as an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the meeting under heavy pressure.
However, the home side came back to life and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for his action at the Climate without a ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from a penalty shoot-out with an approaching Ayr hordes behind him.
The climate changed, much like it did at the beginning of the action, after Kyle Rowe caught a box kick from David Armstrong and sent off Gregor Henry's wing on the fifth try at home.
The Still Game star is launching a new career in the food industry.
The star of the British sitcom Still Game, Ford Kieran, is apparently starting a career in the service industry, and according to our information, he's been named CEO of a company licensed to operate a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life outside of the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source for the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
Bolivia, cut off from the sea, is hoping to restore access to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors are surrounding the naval headquarters in La Paz dressed in sails.
There are pale blue flags on public buildings.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are bounded by the motto: "The sea is our right".
It's our duty to get him back.
Across Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict is still alive  as is the desire to re-trigger the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Now, perhaps the highest hope in decades, Bolivia awaits an October 1 decision by the International Court of Justice after five years of trial.
'Bolivia is on the rise, it has a spirit of unity and balance and, of course, believes in a positive outcome,' said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the international court on large screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that after decades of disrupted negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate granting sovereign access to the Bolivian sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia who will be contesting the controversial re-election race next year, also has a say in Monday's ruling.
"Our return to the Pacific is within reach", he declared in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia  and that if it did, much would not change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there's no question about Bolivia's arguments, it's possible that it's made a step backward in recent years.
'The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government,' said Zarate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric undermined all remaining tolerance of Chile, she hinted.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The countries have not had each other's embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement and achieve mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would still use the maritime issue as a political tool.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.
North Korea refuses to disarm until the United States can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be the first to get rid of nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on its promises made at the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is an illusion to think that the continued US sanctions and protests against a declaration ending the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps toward disarmament first.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest trends in impressive headgear that you will soon find in your store
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself perfectly from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
In their spring/summer 19 collection, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of unusual oversized headgear that infuriated audiences at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the showcase.
Valentino's unique piece was a large beige hat decorated with a paper roof that covered the models' heads.
Other oversized supplements included a melon carved with precious stones, a witch hat, and even pineapple, but these are not meant to warm you up.
Thom Browne also predicted the selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature looked like a diving device, including a snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion expressions, you're in luck.
Style experts predict that giant hats will also make their way to the regular stores around you.
The oversized hats are inspired by La Bomba, a straw hat with a 60 centimetre wide roof that everyone wore, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
A cult brand behind a highly impractical hat that has been lurking around every corner of social media has sent another big creation to the mall, a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wears it.
The burnt orange raffle bag, framed with raffle straps and fitted with a white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 19 collection from Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the stores next summer, and given the designer's huge influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Without language skills, a global citizen cannot survive
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic performance and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of exceptional test results, further strengthening individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, for careers in their dreams, and for a place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement tailored curricula, we still see modern languages as a popular and sought-after subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a person in a language they understand, you speak to their head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you are speaking to his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
And from the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest average scores among independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as selective subjects in both independent and other schools as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.
The UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employer cited as problems with job placement were language skills deficiencies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities arise that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a real benefit in the future with this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent did not speak any foreign language enough to be able to converse fluently, with French being the only language in which the number of people reached double-digit percentages (15 percent).
Therefore, it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially languages of developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ depending on the language being taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always have the choice of a variety of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, there is no denying that languages remain fundamentally important for the future of the country in the global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be called 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellent quality to young people in Scotland.
It's called bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting a while.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be joining the starting lineup for the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes he will play has not yet been determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James has expressed his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
'At this stage of my career, I no longer need to start the pre-match games,' he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today began a series of election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's planned meetings next week, including stops at affiliated sites like Tennessee and Mississippi.
After a backlog of votes for his Supreme Court nominee, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face a loss of control in the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia today, and where can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is being held at 7:00 PM Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below, via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the current hearing of Supreme Court Justice candidate Bret Kavanaugh, who has been strained over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected Senate confirmation vote delayed by a week while the FBI investigations continue.
But the primary purpose of this series of meetings is primarily to help the Republicans, who are facing the difficult November election, regain their power.
According to Reuters, these five meetings next week are meant to "awaken volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that as the busy election season enters, the president will travel to as many states as possible", a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Today's rally, held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to back West Virginia's Republican Senate nominee, Patrick Morrissey, whose preferences are lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and raise his polling preferences", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show courage in battle and hope for success as they enter Sunday's individual matches
After three one-way series, the four-game Saturday afternoon might be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
While the swinging power swing is a fictional sport concept, players do believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, which side do they think the driving force is on now?
"They led by six points, now it's only four, so we could say we have a moderate momentum now", Jordan Spieth said as he prepared for his race day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, a four-point lead and another 12 in the game.
But, as Spieth says, the Americans feel a gentle wind in their sails and have plenty of reasons to hope, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, each scoring three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from the start to the last hole and he led the others by example.
As his lap progressed, the proud celebration screams were getting louder, with the key putt sinking and the fourth match being undecided as he and Thomas were two by two down.
His putt, who won the match to 15, celebrated a similar outcry that proves his belief that the U.S. team is not yet lost in the competition.
"You just have to roll your sleeves and get into it, just thinking about your own game", Spieth said.
None of the players have anything left.
18 holes, you have to reach the maximum.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed favourites of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming European couple has four out of four and can't make a mistake.
Mollywood was the only couple to hit the bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way the energy flows between the stormy crowd and the players confirms that these players will have to be beaten on Sunday, and there is hardly a more popular player to secure a potential European victory over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best of both worlds, at the same time, in different holes.
But the question of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was playing in a duet with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes drilled a pit the Spaniards and the Swedes could no longer dig.
There's no one here on Sunday to help you dig out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are fascinating at first glance because of the interactions between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a substantial lead on the final day, but these foursome laps have also shown that the US team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially on the American continent, have doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the Ryder Cup final day with a significant lead after finishing Saturday's four-ball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The excited duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over the troubled Tiger Woods to put four points into their Le Golf National account so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltin, dominated the losing American side in the morning fourball games and won the series 3-1.
In the four-game series, the Americans offered more resistance, won two games, but failed to match their deficit.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while alongside Molinar, nicknamed 'Molliwood' they are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball matches, they perfectly consolidated their performance, beating down-scored Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled with two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning fourball games, returned to accompany Henry Stenson in the foursome and together they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk a 1 and a 3 in the world rankings.
But Europe was not at ease on that pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record for two points on Saturday.
They earned a 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball matches and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in four-game games after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have the team managed to break out of a four-point deficit in the individual games, although Furyk's side as defending champions only needs a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days in second place, however, it seems likely that Sunday's counterattack will be beyond their strength.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Bank's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant preparatory steps" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and a commitment not to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see no corresponding response from the US, however", he added.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is excluded that we should be the first unilaterally to disarm.
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints against Washington's opposition to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for doing gradual steps, his position was crucial in not immediately dismantling unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to release strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is insisting on nuclear disarmament first and increasing the level of tension through sanctions to achieve its goal by enforcing and even opposing the declaration of an end to war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions are knocking us to our knees is the illusion of people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the Minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the US, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have gotten into such a dead end.
Yet Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missile attacks on US territory were inevitable after President Trump called Kim "a suicide bomber" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea "totally", praised Kim on UN soil for his courage in undertaking disarmament steps, but said he had a lot of work to do and sanctions would remain until North Korea was stripped of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, but it didn't matter if it took two, three years or five months.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue rigorously and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the view that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making gangster demands.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
According to him, Kim told him that the corresponding measures he expected were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The goal of this year's new course at Harvard University is to get all students to get more sleep in an effort to suppress the growing trend of studying all night with caffeine.
Scientists have found that students at the world's leading universities are often helpless when it comes to the complete basics of health care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Clinic, developed a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course by a lecture he gave about sleep deprivation and its effects on learning.
"Finally, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why am I only learning this now, in my senior year?'
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", the Telegraph reported.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to open the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the workweek.
The hourly course shall include a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of a boarding school where students can click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects sports performance and the importance of regular sleep regimen.
In the next section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deficits can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about it, just as everyone has the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes, Professor Czeisler added.
There's still a culture where students are proud to have been able to study all night, he says, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be the secret weapon for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even against weight gain, because sleep deficits put the brain into a hunger mode, so they constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to push the course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step, it will be possible to ask all graduate students to take a similar study programme before embarking on a challenging study.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock to the time they go to bed and the time they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can interfere with your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Meng 's goal has sunk Gerrard 's men .
The Rangers suffered another round of grief in the outfield when Dolly Mengu's shot sentenced Steven Gerrard's disbanded team to a 1-0 loss at Livingstone.
The Ibrox visitors were attempting to record their first outdoor win since their 4:1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his side 8 points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, didn't even come close to a tie.
While the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third, falling behind Hibernian by just one goal.
And the Rangers may have more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence suffered a head injury from an object that was apparently thrown from the guest stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and then Rangers beat Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt left the same Livi 11 who took the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled with how his well-rounded squad strangled their opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were to score only in the second minute of the game when the first call-up of Mengu from the field sent Scott Pittman to the gate of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed his big shot.
A long straight kick from Keagan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to miss the rear pole from a distance.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, they seemed to have more hope than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the penalty after a quarter of an hour of play when he collided with Steven Lawles, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers gave up just two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely got off the ground with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejario's short shot.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts.
The Rangers failed to match Jacobs' corner again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher moved the ball with a stick to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cool and chose Mengu for a simple finish.
Gerrard was on hiatus, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing attacker found Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed out of his line and blocked him.
But Livingston kept forcing the guests to play exactly the kind of game they love when Lithgow and Halkett were shooting one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have held their lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then resisted Lithgow's wide-headed corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton later claimed a penalty for his involvement with Jacobs, but Thomson again overlooked it.
Chronicle: The inventor of the Geiger computer
And now here's a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the construction of a device known as the Geiger computer.
In addition to being an integral part of science, Geiger's computer also became a staple of pop culture when it was featured in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado" by cowboys who were drawn to science, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is this?
Rogers: This is Geiger's computer, detecting radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on headphones, you actually hear the sounds of atoms that radioactivity creates in minerals.
I can hear them really banging!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see the malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and processing them in the laboratory.
They then see the protein common to many types of cancer and inject it back into the body.
The vaccine tested shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient' s immune cells are extracted, modified in the laboratory to detect a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and the cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 supports the growth of several types of cancer including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West with his MAGA hat on his head became a target of criticism for supporting Trump after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spit out in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance that featured US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song, Ghost Town, which featured a hat with the tagline "Make America Great", he launched an attack on Democrats and voiced his support for Trump.
I've spoken to a white man so many times and he's said, "How can you recognize Trump, when he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live (SNL) began with a scene with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's remarks were not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted them on social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by sharing.
West also complained to the audience that he had a difficult time behind the scenes for his hat.
I was bullied in the background.
They told me to go in there with that hat on.
I've been bullied normally!
And then they told me I was down, "he told the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see me down? I'm gonna put on my superhuman coat, because that means no one's gonna tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments earned him at least two public kisses and the rest of the SNL cast were embarrassed, Variety magazine reported, with one person telling the media: "The whole studio was in a grave silence".
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when the song I Love It premiered dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
Westa was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "A message to one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU for standing up to DAVU".
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was just himself, and that's absolutely amazing.
But I am determined NOT to hurt anyone (by buying their music, their clothing brand, or supporting their art) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are too, she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would from now on be known formally as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's continuing in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was also named Snoop Lion, and there's also, of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for the possession of a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police confirmed the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, has condemned toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO action-adventure fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of a boy hero, saying that for such characters on screen, young boys often feel that they have to be tough to respect them.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he says he thinks something is missing and he's thinking about how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones coworker, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt that solving this problem was very important.
"I personally feel it's very important to address where we're missing something in masculinity", he said.
What do we teach men during adolescence when a problem arises that we see now?
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity for his overly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What does television and what is happening on the streets teach that young boys feel they must have this particular aspect of masculinity?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something is missing in young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that when the series ends next summer, there will be no more prologues or sequel to Game of Thrones because he's done with the battlegrounds and horses.
As of November, Kit will star in the new adaptation of Sam Shepard's play True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he thinks has ever come out of Game of Thrones.
"It's this show that I met my wife, so in a way, she gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose Ygritte played the love of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Lesley family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in the intervening years, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Due to conservative country studies, the study estimates that 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee would let GOP senators' data leak, criticizes dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had sent personal data of three U.S. Republican senators to the legislator's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations come from far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked at some point after three Kavanaugh senators interviewed him.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the leaks are linked to Waters' office and provided information about a Waters staff member, Hill said.
"This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false accusations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Her denial is full of anger", Fleischer wrote.
It means she's not in the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh by Democrats who accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the by-election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's big", he wrote.
In its statement, Waters said that her office had notified the relevant authorities and prosecuting authorities of false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and they will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English re-interpretes a sub-dimensional spy parody with Rowan Atkins
Nowadays, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new British film, including this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English, which was first introduced in 2003 by Johnny English and brought back to life in 2011 by Johnny English returns.
Will there be an ironic self-satire about how we're obviously unable to make a new national export?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his distinctive look, has been given the opportunity to ruin everything again  with his name better than anything else signaling that he is a generous comic creation intended primarily for non-English audiences.
He's, of course, the unhinged secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to subtle charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the guy who contributed a single tone to the opening tune of the Chariots of Fire at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012.
His character originally also originated as an international traveler and mysterious man, who Atkinson once played in now-forgotten TV commercials on Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this latest adventure of Johnny English, there are a couple of happy moments.
I liked Johnny English coming to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller hitting his helmet slightly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident here, but humor is a bit sub-dimensional and superficial, especially when big-name film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are already offering comedy as one of their components.
Humor seems to be more geared toward children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's strange adventures are not as inventive and accurate as Atkinson's wordless gags in the introduction of Mr. Bean.
The current background of the film's story is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British top-secret spy web and, to the shock of a working agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately missed a small role, revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and warlike figure who is already on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does what she can with a quasi-Teresha May character, but she has little to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that if every single active spy has been betrayed, she'll have to call someone out for retirement.
So, on the stage comes Johnny English himself, now employed as a director at a luxury institution, who gives private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here are some nice gags as English gives lessons on espionage in the style of School of Rock.
English is then summoned back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets his former long-time bouncing coach, Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to the affected submarine commander, a role that's a bit of a shame for Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who are the masterminds of disasters in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in the field and pointing to the beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, in the performance of Olga Kurylenka.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd fights: in a waitress's change, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volt's house.
All the tricks are coming out of the closing minutes, but no matter how impressive and stormy, it's all kind of like a children's TV show.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And like in other Johnnie English movies, I still have to wonder why the British film industry isn't finally giving Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour reject a four-day work week plan paid as five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to be considering a radical plan that Britain should have a four-day work week but get paid in five days.
The party allegedly wants the management of companies to redistribute the savings gained by the AI revolution so as to provide workers with an extra day off.
That would mean employees would have a three-day weekend, but home would carry the same pay.
The sources claim that the idea would correspond to the party's economic plan to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "We expect the assessment of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
It will not be an overnight shift, but a four-day workweek is an effort that is consistent with the Party's approach to the workers' economy and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has included a four-day workweek in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole has not yet made progress.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The seven-day workweek is not Party policy and is not governed by the Party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell expressed his commitment to regain power from the anonymous CEOs and the wealthy in the service sector.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in water companies would not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government could apply the deductions for the found offence.
It also confirmed plans to recruit staff to company representatives and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to give employees 10% of the private sector companies' equity, which could earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes discussed whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
But of course, Kennedy said.
As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges were filed, I asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, and unambiguous.
But Graham's voice seems to be firmly established.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and there must be some unarmed indictment", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied everything, and Graham added a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one who's appointed can confirm that.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don't see how anything could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event that will feature an impressive array of stars with an even more impressive mission: ending world hunger.
In its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Grand Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If viewers want to get a free event ticket (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful way to raise awareness of the goal of the event, which is ending poverty.
So, with 12 years left, how far is Global Citizen really going to go to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism where people feel they are really making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million shares from its supporters since 2011, which leads to a variety of goals.
The organization claims that these actions have helped to prompt world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group also claimed that the Commission had not yet received any information on the financial situation of the group.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and developers who are committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging to provide Rwandan with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past", Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutition, which will provide nutrition contributions to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult road, we're going to fail and fail sometimes.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York City, along with presenters Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a blockade to limit Russian energy exports, says the undercover inside.
If necessary, Washington can call its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinka is said to have said that Russia's involvement in Syria  where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government  is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I am convinced that the main reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy there exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he said.
He believes there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United States can use the navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that their energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinké spoke to attendees at an event held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that is positioning itself as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He further compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more to use and replace fuel less", he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to support liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, making Berlin a prisoner of Moscow, Trump said.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am convinced that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position brought resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third country interfering with our energy supplies", said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says a senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the snap election.
During a meeting at Holyoke Town Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in top position", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I'll be seriously considering running for president.
Warren said on behalf of President Donald Trump during a city council meeting that she was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm scared to the bone of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
She tweeted on Friday, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Research, fifty percent of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other well-known names among Democrats being talked about in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin is speaking at a meeting of Donald Trump on PTSD.
Track Palin, 26, was drafted into the Army on September 11, 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"As my own son has been going through since he came back, I can identify with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told a crowd at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and told her son and other war veterans that they were coming home a little different, harsher, asking if people had respect for what their fellow fighters and airmen and all the other members of the military had given this country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and holding a weapon in a state of intoxication, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla's police department.
18 States and D.C. support the opposition to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers' objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner and his sons, gang members, abused her, but the U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Representatives of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a high number of U.S. asylum seekers come from, as nations facing a serious problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle, the filing of the amicus curiae brief states.
The representatives further argued in the filing that a policy that denies immigrants entry is detrimental to the American economy because it is likely that they would become entrepreneurs and add the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,Sessions said in his policy statement of 11 June.
Asylum should never have been designed to solve all the problems  even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Pal is doubling and desperate efforts are underway to rescue those who survived
For the rescued, the situation continued to worsen.
"It's very stressful", says Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother, while trying to shake her restless son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palo.
An ambulance is connecting the bodies every minute.
Clean water is a precious resource.
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, digging in their flooded belongings, and rescuing everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake broke through the sewers.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palau, where patients were being treated outside for severe concussions.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the devastating earthquake that shook his fifth-floor hotel room where he lived with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to rescue.
I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying through propaganda
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register's China Daily, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6.
According to US officials, Trump's accusations of Beijing trying to meddle in the US election are a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war, in which both sides are adjusting tariffs on mutual imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade conflict were expected to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his Sunday Des Moines Register post, "China has now doubled its bullying by publishing its promotional ads in our free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, China is taking advantage of America's venerated tradition of free speech and the free press by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a newspaper stand on the streets here in Beijing, you will find only limited disagreements and you will not see any real picture of the varied views that Chinese citizens may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers rejected his offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn that for a debacle with Kavanaugh, Republicans have a chance at women's suffrage.
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn they will be avenged in the upcoming midterm elections, especially by women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely strong and a majority of Republicans have already expressed their desire to vote.
'These things can't be turned back,' Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said in an article for The Hill published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the FBI's request for a last-minute investigation by Senator Jeff Flack (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, nor will they forget November", Karine Jean-Pierr, a consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, told the Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted in the halls of the Senate "November is Coming!" when Republicans in the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
'Democratic enthusiasm and motivation transcend all borders,' Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news portal.
People say that motivation is high already; and that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president, but often don't.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she gave details of her allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a sharp backlash could arise if Republicans confirmed their support for him.
"It's become a big mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about voting on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, it's about how the Republicans have been and how they've been doing", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, which helps vote Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided over who to trust at the dawn of the Ford and Kavanaugh witnesses, with favor favoring Ford rather than Ford.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed out of Flack, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee revealed her genitals to her when they attended a Yale University party in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new Internet to surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will want to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, called Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid enables users to decide whether their data is stored and who has permission to access individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was to "rule the world".
"We have to get to it now", he said of the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data repository or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and work tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, and they're all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal online data repository is that only the user decides who will have access to individual types of information.
The company calls this "enhancing personal rights through data".
Inrupt's intention, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring the resources, process and skills that are appropriate to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could start building their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not arguing with Facebook and Google about whether or not they will implement a complete change that will completely overturn all their business models overnight.
We're not asking them for permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to the next era of the Web very optimistically", added Berners-Lee.
Father Bernard Vann: the celebrations of the World War I Victorian Cross bearer
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrating his 100th birthday in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned of Britain's highest military honor.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was incredibly symbolic that the tablet was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic battle.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his flag across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through very thick fog and behind the fire of field guns and self-immolation.
Later, he rushed across the line of fire and with the greatest bravery led the troops forward, himself destroying three of the field weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I would never approach in my life, but they brought me a deep sense of humility.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, they laid the wreath at the end of the concert, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be able to attend the parade and added that the courage of a true hero demonstrates the support that many people will give him.
MMA fans waited late into the night for the Bellator 206 finale and instead got the series Pig Peppa
Imagine staying up all night watching the thrilling Bellator 206 finale and ultimately missing the main event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches including six majors and was broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were set to face each other, the UK audience was shocked when Pig Peppa appeared on screen instead of broadcast.
Some were really disappointed because they waited until morning especially for this match.
One Twitter fan described switching to a children's story as some sort of sick joke.
"It's a government order that from 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked to broadcast it.
Yeah, it was Peppa Pig.
Bellator President Scott Coker said they would work to make their broadcasts available to viewers in the UK in the future.
"When I think about repetitions, I think we can sort it out", Coker said.
But it's Sunday at 6:00 a.m. local time and we can't solve this before Sunday of our time, which is Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it got out, we exchanged a lot of messages and it wasn't exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you, it won't happen again.
We're cutting it down to five games instead of six, like we usually do, and we're trying to give the fans a little bit more, and we're pulling it.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt undervalued for his sexuality
Olympic water skier Tom Daley says that as a teenager, he felt inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that it wasn't until high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview on the first show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a parent, he started to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
Regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
In his first program stint with Laverne Daley, he said that as a teenager, he felt less than everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls.
In his own words: "To this day, I have felt truly inferior and different, and that has given me the strength and motivation to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said not to let anyone down after they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading LGBT rights activist, using his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky enough to live openly without consequences and wanted to give this hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man of American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, he was surprised.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older last year, but he says the age difference was never a problem for them.
When you spend so much at a young age, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer, it's hard to find a peer who would have had similar successes and misfortunes.
The couple became parents in June, their son Robert Ray Black-Daley was born, and Daley said his overall view of the world had changed.
"If you had asked me a year ago, I would have just said how I need to win the gold medal", he said.
And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't like the idea of death and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you're not gonna be here anymore so you can sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he really stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't immortal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is exactly what I've dreamed of my whole life" "jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
The story also inspired his choice of the song "Proud" by Heather Small, which impressed him in preparation for the Olympics and still causes him cold sores.

Mickelson in poor form, set for Saturday's Ryder Cup game.
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record-breaking 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to show up in better shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has been many times before in the United States, the five-time winner spent the day encouraging and improving his game in the hope of improving his reputation.
The 48-year-old hasn't fired the most direct shots in his career, which is not ideal for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the long course usually takes revenge on the wrong shots.
And as if the pitch alone wasn't enough of a challenge, Mickelson is facing the eventual British Open champion Francesc Molinar in his ninth match on Sunday, who, paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has managed to win every game this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12th individual game, get off to a good start, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely key.
Furious expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
"He understood his role today, slapped me on the back, grabbed me by the lungs and said he'd be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
She has high self-confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and has made a significant contribution to our team in the past and this week.
I guess I couldn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized, and we felt like this is exactly how we had to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Fald's record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
It could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws in a row, although Furyk says his presence has brought some uncounted value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make jokes about people and is a great companion", he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him, and it was great to watch.
His contribution is not just in his game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that strong leadership may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his own experience that a significant lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut in a game in 1997 at Valderram, where the team, led by captain Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but nevertheless crossed the finish line with the closest possible victory of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself how strong we were at Valderram; we had a strong lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won at Valderram, but just like that", Bjorn said in a photo after the 2018 team won 5:3 on Friday and led Le Golf National with a score of 10:6 yesterday.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that the game is not over.
We're going to the gas station tomorrow.
We're gonna get on the lawn and do everything right.
As long as the points are not on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, that's what we have to focus on.
As I've said from the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but I'm also well aware that we're up against the other side against the best players in the world.
Enthusiastic about the way his players performed on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have predicted events.
We're in another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow's going to be a one-on-one performance, and that's something else entirely.
It's great to be on the court with your partner when you're doing well, but when you're on your own, it's a test of all your golfing skills.
That's a message players need to remember to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Björn, colleague Jim Furyk will want his players to play better as individuals than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the big tournaments on the last day of his time on the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up defeated when Europe reached the "Medicine in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to the last day in 1999.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to get started as quickly as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
When this momentum is in one direction, those mid-matches are of utmost importance.
We built our set up and placed the boys in a way that we felt like we were going to try and do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and takes on Rory McIlroy in the top-flight, with the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the top half of the standings.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I thought we'd go all the way", Bjorn said of choosing his individuals.
The new German warship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's latest frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 as a replacement for the aging Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and cost overruns.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the entirely new Baden-Württemberg class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from concerns after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to include high-performance bolts, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some concealment technologies such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important functions include longer maintenance period − it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
But the continuing delays mean that the most advanced warships that have allowed Germany to demonstrate power overseas will become obsolete by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were little known, but German media reported several major software and hardware errors that made the warship unusable for combat missions.
The software shortcomings were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors − only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also showed that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7 000 tonne vessel Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as the similar classes of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) − up from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important given recent warnings that the German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, confirmed that the Navy was not actually deploying ships.
The Government official said that this question had been raised over time as the old vessels were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust uncovers the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how bats use the land to hunt for food.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland study will follow the whistling and sand-blasting bats, as well as the shelters of the light and water bats in the Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
They will place special recorders in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The organisation's staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will identify the frequency of call of bats and the activity of each species.
They then create a map of their natural environment and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of environmental management work, such as the creation of locks and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect grass growth and environmental loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical modifications to building materials, and domestic cat attacks can also be hazardous.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits make their ears look like eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, assembly inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Threave Manor, Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of 10 bat species in Scotland.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a wonderful bat room here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all the good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It stresses the importance of checking bats before performing maintenance on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one maternal population could kill up to 400 females and young, which would likely destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb, or destroy their gatherings.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved in the relief effort.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our networks, and we just don't know how many of our species live".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers sued a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the allegations of rape as fake news and says people want to make themselves look bad using his name.
His lawyers file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese man and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million Instagram followers in a live interview, calling the allegations fake news.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is fake news, the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
They want to be seen by my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for moral damages of the equivalent severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident was supposed to have taken place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada, after a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a good guy who failed by 99%.
Documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared" about retaliation and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to reconsider the deal because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus for a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of carmakers
The UK would forever regret losing its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark.
He added that it was concerning that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker stated that the impact of border crossings could reduce jobs if a no-deal Brexit were to take place.
Burnaston, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern concern what carmakers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a just in time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border disruption, which could lead to delays and a shortage of components in the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily value of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would thus be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was precisely calibrated to prevent these border checks.
'We need to have a deal. We want the best deal that allows us to not only talk about our current success but to seize this opportunity,' he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is the fact that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Works Union, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed to another week as Brett Kavanaugh's battle for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump advisers and Russia and potential presidential omission.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has been a topic of debate for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and to impeach the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has rejected this report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House with new information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which also included Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, "The deadline for this is not set, it could be this week, I understand the move to another week given all the other things happening with the Supreme Court.
We'll see, and I'm always happy to inform the press.
Some reporters denied this claim: Sanders has not held a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of brief press conferences was not due to opposition to TV reporters who want to be silenced, though she said: "I disagree with the fact that they want to be silenced".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
The President holds more questions-and-answer meetings than any other President before him, she added without providing any evidence:Let's look at those numbers.
Soon press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the question directly to the president of the United States, it's incomparably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often, and in the last few weeks you've seen us really often, there will be a short press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, when he showed up loose and, on several occasions, bizarrely in front of a gathering of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express her country's gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working within its public services transferred.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on a withdrawal continued, leading to the expected decisions for the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Reed told reporters he was injured just before halftime.
"He came to the side of the line and kind of collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on the carrier and taking him for further testing.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is in Vanderbilt after surgery.
Harris added that there are no details yet on the type/scale of injury and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore at the university, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before he left the game, he had five total touchdowns, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher flat fees when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged higher flat fees when they buy property in the UK, thus generating additional cash to help the homeless, according to the new Conservatives' plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn 's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the tax on bricks will be levied on non-payers in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announced that foreign buyers will be charged higher flat fees when they buy property in the UK.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and high-income target groups.
The hill tax increase will be collected from individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional funding to support the government in fighting street sleep.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current levy, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental properties after purchase, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who are not UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access the housing system.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns for the large number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower penalty to help young people more own their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by fighting for land but not using it, and urged May to waive quotas for affordable housing to fix the British housing shortage.
Corbyn announced an intriguing series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and ending evictions without blame.
At the same time, he wants to give the committees more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my work to reviving the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
It means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, we cannot allow that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy houses as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the dishonesty of sleeping on the street remains too real.
Jack Ross: My main ambition is to run Scotland
Sunderland football team boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is currently third in League One, three points clear of first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after progressing to the Scottish Premiership with St Mirren last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and it was, Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But as a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in running the club.
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says he has no concerns about such a big club following such well-known names, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly in the Premier League, he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could get the club there".
Ross is only three years into his managerial position, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa's side recover from relegation to League Three and transformed the St Mirren team from relegation to championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled as he joined Alloa's team.
I really believed management was more appropriate for me than acting.
It sounds bizarre because I've been doing well, I've gotten a decent standard of living, and I've enjoyed some reasonable maximum.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I feel good about management.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I do, which makes me more confident than ever in my entire adult life that I'm in the right place.

Analysis reveals the perfect time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat boosted sales at British pubs struggling to survive, but it increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the pubs and bars sector saw a sales increase of 2,7%, but restaurant sales decreased by 4,8% in July.
Peter Martin, CGA's business adviser who compiled the data, said: 'Continuing sunny weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend to the previous month, June, when bargain sales rose by 2.8%, except for restaurants that were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
The hotel with its drinks and bar fared much better than the restaurants, which had declined by considering the same factors.
Restaurants offering food also saw a decline, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% this month, while food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality at RSM, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of domestic sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a year-on-year decline in sales of 4,8 percent will be particularly painful given continued cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come for operators with a worse time supply and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relief.
The overall sales growth in bars and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2,7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of the brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is an established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The survey revealed that one in five children, some under 11, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram accounts
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a Master Account that they will show their parents
One in five children, some under 11, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of fake accounts on Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a cheaper checking account that they show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
One mother, who came across a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage girl urging others to rape her.
A survey by the UK's Digital Awareness Organisation and the Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to draw on her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
'Eilidh is highly respected by the Scottish, British and international athletics communities and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will benefit from being on the right board,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter dash at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has four Olympic gold medals in total and is a regular commentator for the BBC, has overcome a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It's a tiring job, but I've made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging news!
Advertisements for breast milk suction machines that compare mothers to cows are spreading opinions online
A breastmilk company has spread opinions in the online world with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to infants.
To mark the launch of the world's quietest wearable breast milk breastfeeder, consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a sub-Jewish music video to showcase the freedom the new breastfeeder gives mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a dream filled with cows to a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I suck milk, but you can't see any tail, and if you haven't noticed that they're not painted, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues: "I pump, pump, feed, so do babies, pump, pump, pump, suck my beauty".
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions among viewers, with many saying it undermines the horrors of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just as we need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that we will steal our babies within days of giving birth, wrote one woman.
Elvie breast milk powder is hidden in the Elvie/Mother bra
Another user commented: It is understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk suction for mothers who keep their babies?
Another added: "Advertising cut off from reality".
Others advocated advertising, with one woman admitting that the song seemed gifted to her.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a vacuum cleaner if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I sucked milk.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product, written by a woman.
Another user commented: Fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suckle milk (often at their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cow.
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discrete breast milk suction pads embedded in their bras.
The campaign's concept is based on understanding the fact that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's breast milk dryer is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their babies, and even suck and spend time outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development programme, commented: Elvie breast milk powder is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women's and infants' expressions, we wanted to place breastfeeding and all its challenges at the center of attention, while demonstrating in a fun and eloquent way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breastfeeding machine will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up at a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowska, using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved peacefully to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and practices have made it difficult to place children thanks to sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the supporters were illegal immigrants themselves, and they feared they would jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by claiming the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, immigration and customs chief Matthew Albence testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested unaccompanied minors' support.
The Office later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of supporters' households are here illegally, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we're continuing to track these individuals, Mr. Albence said.
Officials seeking to handle child-related matters more quickly have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention and not 60 days after the previous standard, according to the shelter's staff.
Many will present themselves via video conference call rather than in person to present their case to the immigration judge regarding their legal status.
Those who are classified as not eligible for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to an outbreak of violence or an escape attempt, said the shelter's staff and reports that have appeared in the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are increasing in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child suffering are more ignored because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause the trauma that many struggle with.
Syria will ask the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual, who addressed the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the guise of fighting terrorism and will be treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011, and millions displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this sacred battle until it clears all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions were favourable for their return and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fear, which has led refugees to stay away from home.
'We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,' he said.
Politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has thwarted a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which he said would remove.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to the revision of the current constitution and warning of interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
With this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, even though a number of liberal audiences are likely hoping that his presidency will end the impeachment and scandal prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential campaign finale ever!
There's no sign of audience fatigue yet.
Since 2014, the average prime time viewership on CNN has more than doubled to 1,05 million and MSNBC has nearly doubled to 1,6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and Ms. Maddow and Ms. Rachel are ranked as high as 3.5 million viewers in prime time on MSNBC's news evenings.
"This is a lure that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, creator of the drama program "The President" on ABC's series about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer on Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it's funny", Scovell told me.
There's a funny value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only privileged audiences can afford.
But it's beyond an informed citizen to discover that you're spending six hours watching a panel discussion about the deeper background to the source of Bob Woodward's book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth leather bombing bunch of cockroaches and the aftermath of the stormy descriptions, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy according to Stormy Daniels.
I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
"Part of what he does is like a reality show that feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "Pawn Stars", about Trump's daily show with a recurring segment and daily historical battles (a betrayal of the NFL, a nod to Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'd be left behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside on the north shore of Kauai, but he was staying inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just some kind of joke, but they were right.

Money flows in from outside to the midterm elections for the seat
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistricting of congressional districts that has resulted in two candidates battling for a single seat.
This recently renovated Pittsburgh suburb is in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th District.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The battle in the new 17th District affected campaign funding between the major party financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a closely watched March special election to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The city has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators gave the Democrats a slight head start.
The US considered sanctioning El Salvador instead of supporting China, then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight departure from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners moved Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to call off the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions that Taiwan no longer recognizes, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to build on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
However, in mid-September, the senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively end any assessment of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now working on a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance of the meeting the administration assigns to him, diplomats said.
Three U.S. ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new serious reports or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the talks to Mr Bolton, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on terms of anonymity.
Study the History
Another unexpected event could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on a possible obstruction of justice for President Trump, which now has very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation to whether Trump's campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress changed the party, Mr. Trump would face the same responsibilities in this body as he prepares to go back to the electorate and perhaps the jury of his House members.
That's a lot of conditions, if I don't want to imply that Trump's downfall is inevitable -- or its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice about how it can affect the extension of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, but the West had to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the year of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflexible points and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans now face some of these inflexibility points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this report announced that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inability to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is inaccurate.
How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Bret Kavanaugh is not complete or fair − or if it is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, are we going to vote in the middle of a term in Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be put to a pretty long winter's sleep.
I believe we are not failing because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that hooked-cross table.
With a history like this, I just have to be optimistic.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is feeling optimistic about the Rapid Vienna meeting.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented defender Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, only after a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a bridge to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game, and we thought we could win something, and we went with a point.
We may have finally made it a success, but overall, the draw was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed more in the second half and they were a better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us, I'm sure we can push them and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough given my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now it's a factor in why we feel good.
The team's good and the boys really enjoy it, we have great training.
Let's hope we can put last season behind us and be successful.
Women are not sleeping because of the fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members.
About half of individuals in the nationwide study said they talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not give them your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own property - if you have that money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in a crisis.
Get a health care professional to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals meet your needs if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a financial attorney.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in the written plan to be prepared.
"Is it not just about money, but who will be doctors?" asked Martin.
What kind of medication will they take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan in place.
Multiple gunshot wounded in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by an air rifle when he left the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 P.M. local time, as a random act.
Victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and officials said the death toll is expected to rise.
As a result of the crippled communication, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the Regent's Office in Donggala, an area north of Palau, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pal after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic mainstays of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people recall the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with the enforcement of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Highway Patrol.
According to a police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, of course, the television station reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, sentenced to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the VA Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and deaths are expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palos when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare death penalty that hasn't been awarded as a federal crime in the state since 1953.
On October 31, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a cycleway along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and cyclists on the track.
According to the notice of initiation of the death penalty proceedings filed in the Southern District of New York, if prosecutors are to achieve the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious injury.
Both of these charges are punishable by death, according to court documents.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of extortion-related murder, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and one count of violent and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking", prosecutors said, and the way Saipov carried it out was described as "abominable, cruel and perverse".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadetta, Darrell Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucca, the intention report states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last carried out the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the prosecution, Saipov said that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also requested the display of an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge with 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed in the prosecutor's decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of confessing guilt and life in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A conservative member of parliament says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a conservative conference today, made a solemn promise to mobilize the People's Army.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "report a discomfort" from eurosceptics when a member of Parliament, Theresa May, proposed to put her in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the UK would be gone by now if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for Mrs May to ease her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by conservatives with a stance of persistence who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, abolitionists and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition − and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr Bone has expressed his desire to remove the Prime Minister at the Leave Means Leave meeting.
He proposed to Mr Farage to be involved and to be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to remove the Prime Minister".
He expressed his disagreement with the EU, saying: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone rejected the view that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The prime minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for her, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually taking to the streets and getting us first place.
Please leave the Prime Minister alone and start listening.
In a briefing for May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises".
Farage told the meeting that politicians must feel anger if they betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - people - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them.
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger".
We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and we will never be relieved until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, residents marched through Birmingham for the stay and then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A number of activists were waving a banner of the Conservatives against Brexit, a group that was formed this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for security issues with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us they can have in place information systems and all the technologies for borderless borderless and free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to think about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was speculation that she might beat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th City Hall meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that required a woman in top position.
Arrested for shooting Sims from LSU
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who's caught on video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near a Southern University boarding school early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result", Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde went to help his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present, to carrying a gun and to admitting to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-foot-two junior who grew up in Baton Rouge played in 32 games with 10 starts last season averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world title after his team's command brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become apparent that the Mercedes team's commands will play a significant role in the race.
From the top position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost got Hamilton into a bad situation defending his position in the first two corners and challenging Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the boxes and let Hamilton enter the group's tail traffic, which was to be decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop about a lap later and followed Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close race in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend a third time after a double pull.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row and finished seventh in the first round.
He then led much of the race while holding onto the track and focusing on a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
He finally got into the boxes in the 44th round, but was unable to boost his pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Walter worked fantastically all weekend and he was a real gentleman and let me walk around.
The team has done an exceptional job, it has an exceptional combination of two strong personalities", Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn't publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly address the testimony that Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were greedy, disgusting and dishonest.
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
And when you look at the releases and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you published this?
Remember her answer... you published the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't publish it.
Okay, wait a minute.
We've published... no, we haven't, he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and the letter was published in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't publish her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.
But it seems that the president's denial did not sit well with him, who said during Saturday's meeting, "I'll tell you what, it was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but she had the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of indecent sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the claims for their own ends.
They are determined to take power by all means necessary.
You see the cruelty, the indecency, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control, the media reported on the president's statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee Hockey team.
The Dundee Stars offset their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning their replay on Saturday at Dundee with a score of 5:3.
The Giants have a two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, the home team settled, but Dwyer later resumed the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for the Dundee team, but then gave Lukas Lundvald Nielsen two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men, who turned the score around and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two rivals, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul assisting, and four minutes later with David Rutherford assisting, Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the busy opening half, Sullivan returned home runs at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt tied Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the way into the first half when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied the game again with a goal in a goalless game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure a second-half lead for the first time in the match and he took over the half-final win.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play their home games at Milton Keynes on Friday.
The airline operator died to secure the flight of hundreds of passengers before the earthquake.
An Indonesian airline operator is celebrated as a hero after he died ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died, many of them missing, after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to afflict the area, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the wildly moving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palau.
He remained in place to ensure that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait in Indonesia said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter landed in Palo.
"We were very sad to learn", he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the country's disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number will likely continue to grow because many bodies were still under the rubble and many people were not reachable", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters [6.5 feet] in length devastated Palau, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulances are connecting bodies every minute.
Clean water is precious.
Small markets are locked up everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help the rest, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pala on Sunday and told the army in the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, earthquakes struck Indonesia in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Airline Air Niugini reports that one man has been missing in a lagoon after a plane crash
An airline operating a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing after previously claiming to have safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that one man was found missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway began.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It was a huge fortune", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to cross the deep water belt to the emergency exit in a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve the moor also helped with the rescue by using a paddle boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank to about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network databases indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst determines the time axis of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday completed the indictment in a reopened trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He designed for the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis to 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Chambers, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Cell phone records show they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Jessica Chambers' death, Tellis erased her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defence plans to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive news.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has moved away from its political message and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are enjoying a resurgence in fame in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues a couple for termination after a racist text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a mis-mailed text message from a mother who complained she was another black woman.
The couple denies they're racist, compares the lawsuit to a "trial".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed shock when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after the embarrassed Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman realized her shortcomings, she fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their outgoing caregiver, an African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Mrs. Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and demanding $350 a day for six months for accommodation work with the employer she was originally hired to do, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that these things don't happen", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
A couple opposes claims of racism, defends and argues that it was a reasonable move to terminate Mrs. Maurice's employment because they feared that they could no longer trust her after being insulted.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, "Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
But go.
Comparing the action to the trial, Plasco stated that his wife had a child of only two months and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing, the investment banker added.
While the legal battle was still ongoing, the public quickly condemned the couple on social media, commenting on their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not have a relationship with the talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's huge success.
She said her father was an optimist about the rejection of his work, and before he got the idea to write a children's book about a little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC, and she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit of a shock to him because he died last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington's eventual success, which she describes as a very important member of our family.
"He was a very calm man and not a flatterer", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who achieved something: you're proud of him, even if it's not really your fault.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his invention and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me it was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said she was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning slowly leaked and left her system.
She died a short time ago, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not whine, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - despite the suffering she had suffered.
"No one knew about it", she said.
I was head bowed and crying the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
I realized that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Reports of mourning women preventing suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting links to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile would brighten every room.
But he gave up his job before he died because it was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his cousin after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that it will have a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis created links to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly - you have to talk.
Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling sick or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed his mood change.
On Christmas Day, it was full day -- when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything else.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get through it: "It's gonna create a hole in the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh is uncertain because the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something he was asking for - a time-limited or scope-limited investigation - we could agree on something", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned the commission would "break down" amidst obstacles.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 -- if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI draws up the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the indecisive result and affirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korean deserters are falling under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that there were 1 127 deserters last year − compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by the importers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the north will eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Soul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters more illegal migrants than refugees, and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the suspended denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on a nuclear-weapon-free peninsula in a broader sense.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that the lack of progress was due to US sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we would first unilaterally disarm ourselves", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh hysterical, says he's unable to serve on the Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not fit for service on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did it, they would say she was hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated type of assassination" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Mrs. Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve on the Supreme Court because he's shown a vested interest in the Democrats.
"I think she's disqualified by these statements and the way she's persecuting the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was avoiding when asked if she would try to blame Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
I'll say one thing. If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but also to be on the court he's on right now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she considered herself a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions during his hearings.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, obsessed person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Well, isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can't be contained, and she can't talk about it without crying.
"When we get angry, we cry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do I?
She continued: "A woman who was a senior worker helped me a lot, and she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she started using the procedure that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you.
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great.
Tears are sometimes allowed as a way out of anger because they are extremely unintelligible.
One of my clearest memories of my early work in a mostly male office, where I once cried out of indescribable rage, is when an older woman, a cold manager, whom I always dreaded a little, grabbed me by the back and pulled me down a flight of stairs.
"Never let anyone see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're gonna make a mess.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've gotten under your skin.
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart in his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not deal with the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were seven more candidates in the game, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was already underway, she was behind on the fundraising, and so she promised not to enter the game unless she won $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her fans, who gave the man $1,000, would give her just $250.
"Do they think I'm left-handed?" She wondered.
During her speech about not launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she choked.
"You might think I was nervously broken", Mrs. Schroeder said of the pressure response.
You might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my grave.
The one who cried?
How can a trade war between the US and China be good for Beijing
The initial outbursts of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is not far from over, the dispute between the countries could be a long-term benefit for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week occurred with new tariffs affecting items worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively making up half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has paid back in the same way every time, recently collecting tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to cope with American tactics, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to fall that far.
Getting Washington to back down would mean submitting to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, the public tribute to the US would be even more embarrassing.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the US trade war could in the long run positively support China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic turmoil in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than we've observed before", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank focusing on Asia.
Syria is ready for refugee return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, said conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation is more stable and safer here, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that focused on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he did not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the USA team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight games on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot into the water on the 16th hole with a pair of 3s and gave up his game in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to play 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth has eliminated the lowest-ranked player in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 to 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia, from Spain, became a record European tournament winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad we're getting our glass back.
I'm happy to have been able to help", Garcia said, under the influence of the European victory.
He handed over the baton to his fellow countryman John Rame, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods by two holes in the remaining hole in the singles game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of the defeat of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A peculiar statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought all weekend to find the right course except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States has performed unsatisfactoryly in front of his team, and I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning came the time when they displeased Europe.
We fought.
Put your hat down in front of Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna re-create a team, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to have been captain.
Put your hat down.
You beat us.
Current status of red fox: Concentrations are declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red fox concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier are reported to be in a state of uneven coating conditions, indicating decreasing concentrations.
Red chalk reaches about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
The stains can be found about 10 miles off the coast in the Hillsborough area, but in fewer towns than last week.
Red feces have also been spotted in the Pasco area.
Medium concentrations on or off the coast in the Pinellas area were reported last week, low to high concentrations at sea in the Hillsborough area, high concentrations in the Manatee area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Sarasota area, medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Lee area and low concentrations in the Collier area.
Respiratory tract injury continues to be reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory distress has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
