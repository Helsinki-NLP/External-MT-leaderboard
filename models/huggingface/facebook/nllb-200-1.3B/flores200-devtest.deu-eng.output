This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the top and light or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  hooks and barbules , the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature control or for breeding. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of a full-grown one and not the downs of a cuckoo.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult, not a cuckoo.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and wounding more than 20 others.

To determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma current, the luminosity and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, so does the Milky Way exert gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy, and it's made up of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as the large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law is quite strict about the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are available at the start of the election and that no envelopes are thrown in except those of duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process, and in the evening the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was consequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts may be distorted as her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos and other material of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is leading the way in prosecuting, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return of the borders to the state before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects purportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan River.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years from the signing of the agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The protectors of the accompanying pest control trial should be closely supervised by rangers as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
A partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. has recruited qualified volunteers under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick OFlynn, the executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the non-conduct of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating from faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious.'"
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Disaster Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two Black Box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna, too.
"Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman. """
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those polled said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three-division events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question because of his many complaints.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain, as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous individuals confirmed the discovery through various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists are hoping to gain insight into how planets, especially the earth, form.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be provided and no overhead trains will stop at Wembley, with no parking or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
Concerns about lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it had previously been thought that this process took much longer because of mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books, called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice varies according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird, and forms a kind of protective layer.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, nearly every house had a lavatory connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which men and women used in mixed society.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service the bike has done for us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the railroad, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat far smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and equally lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-mouthed roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of growling words roared.
Ozelots eat small animals, and when they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists think that ozeloids track and track prey with their sense of smell, sniffing out where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually matching their surroundings and then leaping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when they move across a mountain range or a river or when they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it used to be.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Specificity is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans expel (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, we make clothes out of plants, we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurians.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on its palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex couldn't stand it.
While we may be familiar with most of their food, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snail, and a rodent called the seabreamer.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have a communal banquet, where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to conform to the will of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room that was open only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurats were erected as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not of great importance.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were just street stalls, and houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Templar's Legacy", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was painted with a treasure map.
Although there is a note on the back of the note, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence", dated July 4, 1776.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly larger group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and that also defines the size of a society.
The European Union is a world leader in the development of the information society, and it is a key player in the development of the European Union.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, the 13 states formed a weak central government, consisting of Congress, on the basis of the Federal Treaty.
Congress had no power to collect taxes, and since there was no national executive or national judiciary, it relied on the federal government, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no authority to overturn interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world, along with the German national team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands that became Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as an ""archipel"".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the native grain-growing methods and employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format in the world is 35 mm, which is the predominant film size at the end of analog film frames.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family, for example) have the exact same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-discredited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple directive that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite their different languages and customs.
His almighty power ruled over everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the basic tenets of Christian belief is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is why the funds of the churches are there.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies to the country, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire stretches of sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras, and each period in China and each family that was in power was a dynasty of its own.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a ruler alone.
After the Revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and the best could succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class, the army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on the Mount of Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, and once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, there is very little to see or hear of this world.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The symbol 'scroll' looks like a V and the symbol 'scroll' looks like a bracket or a square without the bottom line.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Stamping usually produces a softer sound, while stamping is more forceful and expressive.
You can add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789, in Versailles.
They were traveling back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people, making threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the enraged crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest on bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which coincidentally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and second, that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially determined.
It can be argued, for example, that the development of roads is inevitable with the advent of the passenger car.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures developed in relation to that geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, largely due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the supply of Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own, and one of the most important developments of the time was that people began using buttons to fix clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Demand economy is agriculture aimed at producing just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
The subsistence economy is a simple, often organic, crop-sparing type where the ecoregion uses native seeds and combines them with alternative farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differentiate themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, customs and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their childhood because of neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
"Some of the children who were savaged were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child".
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid to assist individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Racks can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of rack, but also the little desk clamp man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are built into the software and are designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to.
We see the foster care system as a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The care home should cover all the needs they did not have in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet connects elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important insights into the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still correctly judge the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
And it has serious consequences if it is not taken: growth depression, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep delay is the process of purposefully waking during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you're forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, which is known to have a diuretic effect) before bedtime, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central concept of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, whereby the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, opens the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collapse of systems, processes and cultures led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and in reality it would be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defenses had already completely collapsed and the only hope was for a retreat and a re-positioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were almost overnight obsolete, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated as early as about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock to get easy access to their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, and were tended by goat herders, often children or adolescents, much like the more well-known shepherds.
In England, conveyor rails were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced early on to secure the position of the rails, but gradually it was realized that rails with a band of iron were more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "right-footed man".
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not stand up regularly.
Double-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little bit.
In many cases, this is just symptomatic treatment, but if you don't want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap-wide pages that still exist are the oldest copies of the document still in existence.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and the symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of swallowing poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "whale" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are highly adaptable insects that parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and predators are nidicol, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental responsibility.
The main goal of science is to find out, by means of the scientific method, how the world works. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often largely based on the presence of body cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic behaviours, which are not just reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that, even in the absence of external signals, perform free-swinging cycles for a period of time.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material concerned and whether the cells concerned are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is the visit, photography, and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems fail so badly, why do they fail every day, are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, since one cannot predict driver behaviour with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a somewhat consistent manner, so traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the track.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and moths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: That the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolves around the earth.
That makes sense, since it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and most water-rich river on earth, flowing more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some up to six miles wide.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans through the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon's main stream is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long, drawing water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole is made up of matter, all matter made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been pushed into the background, so that it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a tipster.
You can be curious about what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the tide and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want the things they do and what influences in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of demand and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can occur when managers start to manage their former colleagues.
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performing performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and committing employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did, and take everything for granted.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? One objective for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the joint work of an organisation to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative method of meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, thus narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumor, affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, strategy and timing, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been incorporated into numerous home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution, where students can look at museum objects from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a compilation album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, although students often have poor grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, but this usually changes as an audience is created.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to learn more about the world around them". The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet material, pupils can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and further north extends the unspoiled beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what outsiders consider to be typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the caprotu from Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (only one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it's not uncommon to be stalked, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences here and there; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
Founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C., present-day Casablanca was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, who named it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tin, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made Timbuktu a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction because of its reputation and has an airport, it is a poor city today.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a wild card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling balcony diagram, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urbanisation is concentrated on newly acquired land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove belt, stretching for over 50 miles [80 km] from the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps  they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges basin.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife refuge since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer now live there.
Buses depart from the cross-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.x
Collective taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oyapock River and connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two carriageways with a width of 3.50 metres.
The bridge has a clearance height of 15 metres and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great West Indies, was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and sales offices for polo tickets can be found at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance as to which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, with temperatures above +30 °C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: The temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority has instructed visitors to stay at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, moose, bears, and virtually all other large animals may appear, they may still turn aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them enough space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that has a strong smell, and keep your storage facilities clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous naval engagement in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australia are perhaps better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without worry, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
"To Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is foreign. A small black is espresso, cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Quicksand occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campground near the music.
Remember that parts of the festival will still play music late into the night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as ice breaking causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city.
Casinos usually make a great effort to keep guests in the house as long as possible and to spend a lot of money, as there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood and to ensure that they stay.
Some gambling establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
If you want to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the load is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or rolling snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a trip overland to observe the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can better observe them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, hiking, or footing) consists of a hike that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events being held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation guidelines vary, but as of late March, most cancellation guidelines due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing about ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them, and many hotels lend iron and ironing board even when you are not in the room.
If iron is not available or you do not want to wear braided socks, you can try using a comb, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this may cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which have proven more effective in countering certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you're concerned, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown to them in their home regions.
Insects can destroy food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, even cause allergic reactions, poisoning, or disease transmission.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods that are exempt from duties and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country is highly taxed can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the most challenging to drive, as it often passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the track, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples being cooked into cakes all year round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, pancakes, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or moist depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attributes, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the preference of the Javanese for peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
The rider's feet are supported by a support, which hangs down on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets his foot caught on the tread, he can be dragged along as the horse passes.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a sole and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety anchors which allow a saddle belt to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley  Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless opportunities.
Descent sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you attach a ski or snowboard to your feet and ride down a slope over a snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as Skipenner, planning their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpack skiing: This activity is also called ski touring or skiing.
It is similar to alpine skiing, but does not necessarily include mountaineering, as the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a comparable hiking trail.
Under good conditions you are able to cover slightly longer distances than you would on a hike  very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country running on well-maintained tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport checks if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are considered antiques.Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit in areas such as North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture of trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, too, not all Sámi raised cattle on a large scale, but lived by fishing, hunting, and the like.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
"An Internet search for "Hostile Environments Course" will likely show the address of a local company".
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a gender reassignment operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
The inspections of security checks have also become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact while passing the scanner.
Rip currents are the returning current from beach-breaking waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in an attempt to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you come out of the current, it's no more difficult to swim back than it normally is.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, maybe wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture may find it particularly difficult to adjust to their culture of origin.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country would have to adjust.
Patience and understanding may not be expected of returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's quiet before the show starts.

The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020 there were sixteen active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula cross over here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Mountain range, which is split in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (14,932 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, and by expeditions requiring data and voice telecommunications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a cross-country year programme can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
The student must pay a fee for the application to these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to see the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or one in eight owning a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is 1 in 40).
Most purely Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, returning in the evening and staying on the ship.
If you only land on the excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships list Berlin in Germany as their destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how planes work and how they operate during a flight can help some to overcome fear of the unknown or of feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly, and time is often a very important factor when it comes to company documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies difficulties arose.
If they were shipping goods by air, it could take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method of flying first or business class is to add a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to get your own company to cover the cost).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for business and eleven-class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of airmen who are willing to pay a lot of money and demand a corresponding price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.

There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats, and brown chickens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have wrap skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
