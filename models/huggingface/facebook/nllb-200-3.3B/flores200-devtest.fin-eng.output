This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside, according to the researchers.
The discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed tail called a tail, but they do have other features of feathers - such as a tail and a whirl - the researchers concluded that the tail was likely a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The structure of the loops suggests that they were not used for flying but for thermoregulation or sounding devices, and even though the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers identified the specimen as being from the plumage of an adult rather than from the plumage of a juvenile.
Even though it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers presented the sample as coming from the plumage of an adult rather than the plumage of a juvenile.

The work was theoretical at first, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to observe tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity affects the earth, causing tides, so the gravity of the Milky Way affects the dwarf galaxy of the Sagittarius.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is surrounded by a glowing halo of a great number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a form of tuberculosis that is highly resistant to drugs (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate.
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them were hospital health-care workers.
A person infected can infect 10 to 15 close contacts during the year.
However, the percentage of all TB cases with XDR-TB still appears low, with  6 000 out of 33 000 cases annually in South Africa.

Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of the large caverns on Earth, which often have fairly uniform temperatures, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS astrogeology team and a faculty member at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has not traditionally been high-tech: the voters lock themselves in the booth and place the envelopes on a piece of paper, pre-printed with the candidate they have marked.
After the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the authorities, the voter shall drop the envelope on the ballot box and sign the voting register.
French electoral law has determined the course of events with comparative precision.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the event, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under close supervision and following the prescribed procedures.

Deputy Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped a Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed as the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been tried in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of his son.
He's been arrested pending charges and a trial, but eyewitness evidence may have been tampered with, as his image has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and courts have considered that the publication of images could be detrimental to the fairness of the trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University observes that "journalists do seem to be balancing dangerously if they publish suspicious photographs and so on".
The Crown Office, the public prosecutor in Scotland, has given the press a heads-up that there will be no further comment, at least until the case is brought to trial.
According to LeDoe, the document refers to a border line where Palestinians want the borders to be the way they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem as holy to both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continued military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority accepts such a presence for only five years.
The rangers were to keep a close eye on the shooters participating in the complementary control experiment with the animals of the forest, for the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Eligible volunteers were recruited as part of a joint project by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Federation of Australian Sport Shooters, and as part of the Munmun Federation's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first round of shots received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional election council in four years.
The President's delegation last month recommended the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at bringing the country to new elections.
The council was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
The protests, which at times turned violent, were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which were due to be held as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of iPods with malfunction have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four persons.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the device.
Last week, the department announced that Apple had notified it of 34 other cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The State Department responded by calling Apple's delay in the investigation "really regrettable".
The quake hit the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has been holding Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was killed in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a gynecologist and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm birth during the spring.
His studies showed that giving the hormone accelerated the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official search team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she died two months later, a very unique case, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe more... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme extremes, 29 percent of the survey respondents feel that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent feel that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic winner was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200 freestyle and three medley events at the Commonwealth Games, but her condition has been uncertain due to pain.
He has not been able to take the necessary pain-relieving medication because it is forbidden to use it in competitions.
On January 25th, mathematician Curtis Cooper, a computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to man.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery on various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to the earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the earth, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political speculation and ridiculous".
He's expected to run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration claims that NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground-based radar, enabling air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no additional transportation, no overland trains stop at Wembley, and no parking or access parking services are available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species had already developed within two generations, although the sequence of events was thought to have lasted much longer, due to the interbreeding of the native Darwin's bee (Geospiza fortes) and the newcomer cactus (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny objects.
You can pull it into thin wires, you can twist it, you can weave it, you can hammer it, you can roll it into boards.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures in books called "book pictures".
This is called the pH value of a chemical, and you can make the meter yourself using the juice of the cochineal.
The color of the lime juice varies according to the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (pHnH) in the test chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then crush them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture in your hand reacts with the top layer, which feels strange, forming a kind of shell.
In the towns of Harappan and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to an elaborate sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Greece, Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had baths, and in Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed together in the same spaces.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you're using satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet long.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it's done for us is make it much easier and faster to travel.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them come the more medium-sized caterpillars, which eat medium-sized game from rabbits to antelopes and parrots.
Then there are many small felines (including the free-ranging pet cat) that eat small predators, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which number much larger.
The secret to their success is an ecological locker, a concept that says that each cat has a specific job to do, so it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all the felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave much like wolf or dog cubs, which are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other large felines), and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only felines that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not so much a reminder of the lion's roar as a phrase made up of a few words shouted from the mouth.
Oselot prey on small animals, prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them, and almost all the animals Oselot prey on are much smaller than Oselot.
Researchers believe that the oselot tracks and finds food by the smell of prey from the land where it has been.
The ossuary can see very well in the dark because of the dim light, and they move very inconspicuously, and they hunt by blending in with their environment and then rushing out to attack their prey.
When a group of small organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is native (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or river, or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from what it was before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the main population over time.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations look so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species, and speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and use carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun by connecting with it.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was a great beast of its own time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and its jaw had extra teeth, so that no one who got in its way could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have done it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, squirrels, and a rodent called the nut-mouse.
In another contrast, the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, but the rich preferred communal feasts, where they lounged on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Rome's meals could not serve the kind of food that only centuries later came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurate were built around temples.
The top of the tower was the god's special sanctuary.
In the warm air of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, and shops were just open-air stalls in the streets, and stone was used as a building material.
In Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited, and in the Norse sagas, it was said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that as he travelled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has an inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The inscription is in the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was originally rolled up for preservation.
So it's likely that the inscription was just added as a name tag.
D-Day, or the landing and subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was occupied by the so-called Vichy France, that is, by the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders, not fighting them.
The Allied invasion of southern France on August 15, 1944, codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the South of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means citizen, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city, and it also kind of defines the size of society.
The city-states are the predecessors of the nation-states. Civilization culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, a long-lasting cultural footprint and a high degree of diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are not generally considered to be true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - the only part of which was the Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the power to change tax laws and interstate duties.
Amendments to the articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states were so overwhelmed with the central government that often their representatives were not present.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national team in the world, after Germany, having won the World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller derby, and Formula One motor sports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and in the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the grouping of the islands of Japan, Japan is often spoken of as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan was known as early as the 15th century, when European seafarers sailing past mentioned the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan in 1624, initiating a change in the indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers for their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 proclaimed Taiwan as a province of the Qing Dynasty.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common size used in still images is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced, but above all the image sensor formats of the digital camera have inherited its image ratio.
A bit confusingly, the size of the 35 millimeters is actually 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
Hence, the ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family) either correspond to or are very close to this image ratio.
The oft-abused and much-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamic in the picture while still maintaining some order.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the point where the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds cross (see example).
At this period of European history the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being closely scrutinized.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, kings as well as commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are for such purposes.
The centrality of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the validity of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire oceans and endangered even neutral ships.
Since tactics only elicited limited responses, Germany expected a similar response from its unlimited submarine fleet.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods: Each stage of China, or each ruling family, was its own dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of unstable provincial division between each dynasty, the most well-known of these periods being the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to gain access to the highest seat in the mighty palace of Xi'an.
The social and political consequences were many, including the introduction of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the job was opened up to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same was true of the army, because military ranks were now based on ability rather than class rank.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life, and he often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira, located on the mountain of light, called Nur.
The cave itself, left untouched by the ravages of time, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountain to the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if you know it's there, and once you're inside the cave, the isolation is perfect.
You can only see the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, and inside the cave you see or hear very little of the underworld.
The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Giza Sphinx.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward arrow is a V-shaped mark, and the downward arrow is a square or a rectangle with no lower line.
The upward bow means that you should start from the tip and push the bow; the downward bow means that you should start from the fross (the part where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The ascending bow is usually softer, the descending bow is stronger and more dense.
You are free to add your own notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed suspension marks are in the notes for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of workers forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They returned by carriage to Paris, surrounded by a mob, and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariots wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd was waving the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles in front of a shocked queen.
The Filipino people had to pay the war costs of the American imperialism for the occupation of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government, which covered a large part of the cost, and to pay the interest on the bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of U.S. imperialism, of course, was the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the background against which the organization was born.
The period of events is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas from the impetus of technology, i.e. the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is governed by a logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology in turn has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on society.
For example, one might argue that the invention of the automobile inevitably led to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars leads to more road accidents, which leads to the invention of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major element of Romanticism, and it was borrowed from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals, and over time, the habits and culture of that geographic location were formed, and because these were in harmony with society, they functioned better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, much as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100.
Its position weakened in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued above the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was then that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication routes, Western European styles may have been lagging behind by 2530 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the era was the introduction of buttons to attach clothing to the clothes of the Crusaders.
A subsistence farming system is one that produces enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system, using seeds native to the ecoregion combined with rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel rejected by society's norms, and so they are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as its own and distinct entity may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality related, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often communicate their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, etiquette and slang.
One of the most common ways of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use the example of the rare unfortunate children who grew up without the socialization of adults, either as a result of neglect, bad luck, or deliberate exploitation.
Such children are called "outsiders". Some children have been ostracized by people (often their own parents), and in some cases, the ostracising has been due to the parents abandoning the child because of a serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to be domesticated animals, some said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a feral puppy has been raised entirely by an animal other than a human, he will behave (within his physical limits) in much the same way as his pet caregiver, for example, showing similar fear or indifference toward humans.
The aim of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting.
Ladders are not a learning method but a tool to support individuals in a new learning experience, for example in using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The sticks can be both virtual and real, so the teacher is a kind of a stick, but so is the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladders are built into the software and are intended to ask questions, give instructions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to do without any help.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educating, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our shelter system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable health care.
The purpose of placement is to provide all the basic conditions for children that they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet imply additional dimensions in the case of the end-use theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are presented as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" as new influential perspectives when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video equipment has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-worlds, or facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sources of genetic modification: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, selection removes it from the store of previously manifested variation.
Differentiation and recombination, with each generation, carry the variation back and forth between these two stocks.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has a hard time getting enough amino acids from plants available in the savanna.
Moreover, their lack has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and legumes, but those are difficult for our primates to digest without ripening.
By contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digested and also provides a rich supply of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Thus, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening during a normal sleep cycle and then returning to sleep a little later (after 1060 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not awaken the person completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or a tea known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which makes it necessary to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force, and it is possible for everyone to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that prevents us from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but with the addition of the concept of maha-janas, or the great path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga, where the visualization of the deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and develops the awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and that's why the Soviet Union and the United States worked together, and after the war, the collision of systems, practices, and cultures led to a rift between the two.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was real, for the proxy armies fought on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers broke ground and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine by attacking Poland's east, in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that the nation maintains its ability to move its own people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the United States tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was mostly using submarines to try to block this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and wool.
The goats were usually raised in herds, roaming the hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds, often children or young ones, such as the better-known sheep herders.
Carts were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted of only parallel wooden rails, they enabled the horses to pull the wagons faster and with greater loads than on the slightly less level roads of the day.
Railroad poles were used early on to hold tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were topped with an iron rail.
The practice became common, but iron consumed the carriage's wooden wheels more than iron.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767 the first cork-iron rails were put into service.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it did not walk upright for a very long time.
Bipedal specialization is found in the 4.2-3.9 million-year-old fossil Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that's going to be.
This is often just like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want to be a mere temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's wasteful way of life.
After the convention approved it on July 4, the handwritten copy, signed by the convention's president, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap Open Sheets, were printed.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and one copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap scrolls known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document, although no original handwritten copy has survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like nightingales.
They have feet with fins and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers  or bits in the computer world.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
A sure sign of internal intoxication is a visible, opened medicine jar or container of a toxic household chemical.
See the first aid instructions for the specific venom on the label.
This is the group of insects that entomologists call "bony".
The term comes from the fact that in ancient times, lice were very common, and lice are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the beetles and the wasps are nest-dwellers, adapted to living in their host's nest or enclosure.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own best interests or in the interests of their child.
These couples may, if they wish, draw up an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights to parenthood, allowing the other couple to act as the child's parents.
The primary purpose of science is to use the scientific method to understand how the world works, and the scientific method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not just about doing experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek became less well-known in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in body structure and behavior often depend very much on the existence of innate cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely responses to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to cycle freely for a certain amount of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's study was one of the most important indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments, either by labelling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or by radioactive fracking of the phage protein.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the landscape  including wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and exploring information about the ecosystem.
One example is the visit, learning, and photography of the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, residents of small rural towns drive to work, and they are met by others who have jobs where they left.
In this dynamic chocolate-bulb movement, everyone is somehow connected to the private car-based transport system and at the same time supports it.
Science now suggests that the vast carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard as often.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation designers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, since it is not possible to predict with 100% certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform way, so traffic flows tend to have a fairly good consistency and can be represented in a rough mathematical way.
To better describe the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in road planning, design and maintenance.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The wolf-tailed jackrabbit and the sunbird are now the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, and it has more than eight times the amount of water that the second largest river has.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at its widest point, 6 miles.
A full 20 percent of the water on our planet that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction of the pyramids at Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the world's smallest independent state and the smallest country in the world by population.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and in its official communications.
Most of the people working in the State also speak Italian in their vernacular, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known to man since ancient times because they all occur naturally in nature and because they are also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter - solid, liquid, gas and plasma - in the same order, but he also theorized that they change into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as coal.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that they could fit into the closing sentence of this sentence by the trillionth.
So the lead pen was a good friend to many when it came to the market.
Sadly, as new writing methods have developed, the value and purpose of the pen have been abandoned.
Nowadays, messages are typed on a computer screen, and the sharpener never needs a hammer.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus, which is made up of many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they are prone to break apart from little or no nudging.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called its crust.
The thickness of the moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the Earth's visible side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
The dark areas may be more prominent on the visible side because the shell is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus primarily on what is behind or what attracts people to behave.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start to lead their peers, two different behavioural patterns can generally be formed: at one end of the scale, the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "the guys").
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people to account.
At the other end of the scale, man is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
The expectation is that virtual teams will be of the same quality as traditional teams, but with some very nice differences.
The virtual team members act as liaisons for their immediate physical team.
They often have more decision-making power than ordinary team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, to which all members report, and the invisible team determines the level of demand for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, a process in which an organisation works together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The proliferation of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is about trying to make machines perform automatically tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and hand, voice and face recognition.
These have become distinct fields of study that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, just as it is embedded in many software applications for home computers and video games.
Class trips are an important part of teaching, and oftentimes a teacher would like to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is technology, virtual class trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at a desk.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennett School design a website for their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, and in the early stages of the student blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often sloppy, but the presence of the audience usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work on improving her writing and avoiding criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". e need to stimulate the interest of the reader inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical, and by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position against the background of other people's writings and bring their own perspective to the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums to showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the pristine, scenic Muskoka, among other places.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders view as a parody of Canada.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely inhabited, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than in Canada as a whole.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of these, and its nature is like that of its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and they are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them, and it gained a lot of support in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women  All female travellers are encouraged, regardless of their actual marital status, to say that they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it does not look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may experience as harassment, it is not unusual for someone to follow, grab an arm and so on.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to take sides (cultural differences do not justify sexual intimacy!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber settlers, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco as Dar-ul-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
The old medina is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagine, clayware, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of embroidery, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a resort town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano's lava devastated Goma, burying most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but any excursions outside the city require preliminary investigations to determine the current state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano climb, and it is where some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa are found.
To get around in Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle tax); the normal (local) tax is about 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
When this is combined with its somewhat awkward location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a run-down city, though its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the threat posed to the desert by the sand.
It was one of the main stops in the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab feel than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and Crocodile Lake to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature reserves, each of which supports a variety of fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily protection and admission fee, as all national parks in South Africa.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a major destination for many tourists.
The pattern of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to the shimmering pattern of the bays that is best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best parts of Hong Kong are seen from the island and across the harbor area of Kowloon.
The majority of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on the northern shore of the built-up land.
This is the place where the British colonial masters took over, and if you're looking for signs of the area's colonial history, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and India's backwaters.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangroves; they are some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plateau.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about one third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and about 30,000 Akshashirvas.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those to the east and to Jakarta and Bumthang, depart between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since the buses in the area are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the counties are served by small Japanese Coaster coaches, which are nice and supportive.
Kimppataksis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paroon (150 ngultrumi) and Punakhan (200 ngultrumi).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 273 feet, it is 1,100 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] slabs.
The bridge has a 15-metre span, construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazil's border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important of the indigenous groups in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-pastoral hunters but also practicing self-sufficiency agriculture.
The Chaco area was inhabited by other indigenous tribes, such as the guaycurut and the payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "giant nation of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples of the land in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best pool teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Ground.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
The Argentine Polo Union will provide news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are the main currency used throughout the islands, and Stanley is often used for credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the Outer Islands, although UK and US currency may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands themselves, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere, while winter is winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and during the summer months, temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [90°C] are common.
Winter can be a treacherous ordeal: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make the air appear colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no special rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife.
Bions, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack, even though they may look very tame.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, bear in mind that the odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships - German, American, and British - refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two ports, and the most popular are located in three different areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor borough) are along the Pacific coastline and extend from north of Long Bay south to Devonport.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the harbour of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes busy family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It's not a multidimensional beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing.
There are several French wines worth tasting, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the road.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find for the cautious.
The idea of a flat white type of milk coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of cream foam instead of foamed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The cocoa is Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
The reef is the site of many year-round excursions, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
So ignore the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cuckoo is found north of 1770 near the beaches and river banks from October to April, and occasionally at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and are likely to swim away.
The coastal plains are not primarily marine, but their primary habitat is the river plains from Rockhampton to the north.
By booking in advance, travelers gain the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have special offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation in force if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, all changes and requests should be directed first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp in the area, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive on time to get music close to the campsite.
Remember that even after the main stage music shows have ended, there may be venues at festivals where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cab, as the worst parts of the ice break are particularly noisy.
The St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city, and cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (specific conditions).
Casinos typically try to maximize the time and money spent by their customers, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood  and on the casino premises.
Some places will serve alcohol on the house, but drunkenness weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at high latitudes or in mountainous terrain should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive the way you would on asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow can fall so much in a very short time that a car gets stuck.
Snow or snow in the wind, moisture or ice on vehicle windows may also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest draw and a highlight for many visitors.
Nationally, the word safari refers to a journey by land to observe Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is well suited for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, camping safari, and hiking) is a form of hiking that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
The cancellation procedures vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation procedures did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with the average ticket price being ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry, and many hotels offer to lend you irons and ironing boards, even if you don't have them in your room.
If you do not have a ironing board or if you are not particularly fond of ironing socks, you may try a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have doubts, consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter predators that they are not accustomed to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poisons and spread diseases.
Virtually any contagious disease or any dangerous animal that can violently injure or kill humans is not usually considered a pest.
Tax-free purchases mean the possibility to buy products in certain places which are exempt from excise duties and sales taxes.
Travelers to heavily taxed lands may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging on the Buffalo/Pittsburgh freeway, as it is repeatedly traversed in remote forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on guard: there are many steep ascents and descents, narrow lanes, and steep curves.
The speed limits imposed are considerably lower than those of the earlier and later sections  usually 35 40 mph (56 64 km/h)  and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria quite spicy and varied, reminiscent of the pastries of Austria, its southern neighbour.
Fruit pancakes are common, and apple pancakes are made all year round, with cherries and plums being popular fillings in summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and the popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but firm pancake, try one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a food based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a superlative that covers a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But when used without further specification, it generally refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
