The UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet this month with foreign ministers from the five permanent council members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had made this situation unresolvable.
The five permanent members were called upon to show the solidarity and unity they showed when they succeeded in concluding an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
Eight numbers from the polls that show Donald Trump has a real shot
Some tried to label him a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to push Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by a double-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul's chances of being elected.
Of course, it's still too soon.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's lead gave way to Herman Cain in the polls, but neither of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why he would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start backing him with money.
Here are some recent polling figures that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing fad:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two in 10 said they would be "upset" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be enthusiastic vs. 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "angry" if front-runner Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans still believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
Yet 44% feel he lacks the personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament is not welcome in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the intellectual stance, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who had the most chances of winning the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters didn't read the future very well.
In the same time period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, versus only 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these numbers show that a majority of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even though the Republicans are retreating to another candidate, Trump is still leading everyone.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will split to more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always have majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and finally 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that more than half of Trump-supporting voters say they won't change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he's twice as likely as voters to say they decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his opening campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a central issue in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
According to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A two-week poll in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54% saying they are "dissatisfied" and 21% "extremely nervous".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Ever since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at the PMQs has been long-awaited
New Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut later on Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of his six questions shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely watched by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he asked for "less theater and more facts".
It also stated that it could give up some shares and that it was transferring them to its colleagues.
The showdown will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech at the TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep the silence at the reading of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept his silence respectfully" and acknowledged the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing through differences of opinion over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are "cumulating" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position on the European Union and the benefit cap.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely remove the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister for Work and Pensions, said the party was "very clear" in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the level of the "cap" from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the gallery in the last decade since he took over as leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says he has ideas "from outside sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MEP Islington North said PMQs involved too much confrontation and that he would refrain from backlash and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn has stated that Angela Eagle, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will hold his seat at the PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr Cameron stated that he wanted to abandon the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his approach.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his standing among fellow parliamentarians, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs a deep reform.
Joburg picture: Homeless youths take photography lessons
It's hard being a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of the areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports head says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says that an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.
However, it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise and not criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the storm created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more praise than criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as Special Ks,, was dragged uncomfortably into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous slip against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fierce qualifier played shortly after in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated: Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down.
Although he was last seen doing a dust jacket after having muscle cramps and missing a potential US Open, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the singles, behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little bit into the conflict", Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he was accused of cramping in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But let's be honest, he handled himself extremely well in some pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and he's integrated into the team, he hasn't had any conflicts with the other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in excellent shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his strengths and weaknesses.
Healy also supported the decision to discount Kyrgios for the important draw game starting on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the best fit for everyone, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra native to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has climbed up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's maturing under the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs some time away from the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
With at least five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentage points.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
Support among men has dropped significantly and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, now tied with Sanders.
Still, Clinton is still ahead of the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a two-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run for the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reservedly and another 15% would support it simply because they represent the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be thrilled with her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the top-ranked Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the appropriate experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the office (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential bid, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he should not run.
When asked about the second choice for the party's representative, Democratic voters are overwhelmingly naming Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, the numbers are down from 78% last month.
Biden is a distant second but the percentage of those who say he's the most eligible has risen.
However, when asked what is most important about an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
As in the past month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in a few key characteristics compared to their party's primary voters.
Most voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trustworthiness and as having solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is trustworthy and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, share the same ideologies as they do.
On all these issues, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions persist regarding Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say it did not affect their overall opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March on the matter, shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that the email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say they've changed their opinion of Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be trustworthy and trustworthy, this issue continues to raise concerns among voters in general: only 32% consider her trustworthy and trustworthy, down 8% from last month and 15% from May.
62% of voters don't consider her trustworthy and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide don't consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Yet both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of people who think Sanders is a good guy is higher than the number of people who don't, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity members indicted for the murder of first-year Baruch College student
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his hospital admission, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put behind a 40-pound backpack full of sand and was repeatedly bludgeoned as he tried to make his way toward a target on icy ground.
Mr. Deng reported headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi members failed to call the emergency number after he passed out and claim they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the fraternity before the good of Michael Deng", Wagner said.
He couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternity rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals", said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this action by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury has recommended that the first five members be charged with murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with outrage and accessory to murder.
"We want to hold not only the people involved but if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable", Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what's gonna happen when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rate.
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna happen and how long it's gonna last.
In economics, history offers few clues as to time frames.
After the first interest rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should focus not on when interest rates start rising but on the trajectory of the time it takes for the normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at play.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all the excitement about the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But there will be some effects.
Here is how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate hike may volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
There appears to be a trend for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, perhaps again reflecting the disorder in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed increases.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14 per cent - moving towards an interest rate rise, which is fairly constant for the 250 days afterwards (average rise of 2.6%) and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate cycle and the benefits begin to decrease.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
The Fed is facing conditions that have never existed before and could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic low for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5%.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question 'is it different this time?', Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a Fed rally all year, with all eyes on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which closes on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase at this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study since 1950, all interest rate hikes to date have been in a super-cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery began", the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continuing.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, bond yields immediately decline, Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategists believe that these interest rate increases will bring the yields of short-term and long-term bonds closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds perform better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing yields", Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation forecast, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is straighter, the average credit rate spread has widened and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightening policy.
In general, companies that are mainly active in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt will be more expensive.
History shows that quality stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase, Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed firms with weak balance sheets after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases by an average of 5 percentage points.
The companies with high capital receipts and low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies of lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a major issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the rise of the dollar.
Savers may also have something to gain, though experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the radio station for being "stupid".
He claims to be increasingly similar to the trade adversary
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the British Awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a senior MP has said, putting pressure on the station to prove it does something commercial stations don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chiefs that the public broadcaster is "stupid" and increasingly resembles the commercial adversary.
"I feel Radio 3 is 'stupid' - although I don't like to use the word - but I feel it is becoming Classic FM", he said.
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be the Brits under another name.
So if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that are just copying what's already on the market", said Mr Bingham.
The BBC's director general denied the allegations, stating that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna get anywhere with the classical music I hear on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivaled.
"In addition, I think it's also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new tracks", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said that they needed to do more to attract an audience than they had in the past because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC brand criticised at the Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and does not stand out in anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the judging panel - be made "in a BBC-specific manner".
He added that he wants the corporation to "find the chicken with the golden eggs in its own backyard" the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to prohibit future pick-ups of new seasons of The Voice or spend the money that goes into licensing other entertainment formats.
Internet sales saw the slowest growth in August and Black Friday could be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month saw the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales really took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones for shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could lead to spending restraint.
Over the past decade, online shopping has exploded and turned shopping streets in the UK into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are slowing, with the latest figures showing an increase of just 7 percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the slowest increase since 2000, with only a 5% increase in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are slowing, with the latest figures showing an increase of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
'If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time', Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using mobile phones to shop.
This has increased the number of people who can shop online and can do so in various circumstances, such as from the couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little bit, you might see a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that shoppers would refrain from making purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crammed into their computers to get their hands on deals, which led to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers have been fighting for their money, could cause customers to be reluctant to buy.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than shopping in fashion stores in shopping areas.
After sanctioning the bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed in crane collapse in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured in the crane collapse.
In the street parade, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy place where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In a street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide that detail, but said that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered ahead of the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.

Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers to convert loans into Swiss francs into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the elimination of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
The downside may come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting the loans granted by Volksbank into francs and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers a three-year fixed interest rate of RON 1,5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of Transilvania was accepted by 83% of the customers with francs due to two successive reductions: the balance with the amount of risk and administration fees paid by the customer was reduced, then an additional 22,5% reduction was applied to the LEI balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to what they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42,5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the CHF loan conversion is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future franc increases and the loan will be repaid in the currency in which he receives his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of the property, no additional guarantees and no further proof of income are required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a monthly discount rate on what customers were paying before the conversion, equivalent to lei.
The risk
The problem is that the interest rate in the first few years is mostly interest, and the customer pays very little back in principal.
The very low interest rate offer of Bancpost for the first three years seems to be advantageous for customers.
It is not known how this interest rate will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3,25%, so overall, the cost savings are lower.
A potential risk for all floating rate lending in lei is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009 over 15% and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs not mentioned in the initial offer may also arise.
It 's time for the Federal Reserve to make interest rate decisions .
The world's eyes are on the meeting scheduled for two days from now, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of whom last week thought the decision would be made now think it will be around for a while and that interest rates will stay in the current range of 0 to 0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and start a process of normalising interest rates, said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for a rally but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Celebrities Who Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), have been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia and in 2009, he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.

All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been sidelined for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the Champions League match against Manchester United, which ended in a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the tear-jerking event that will keep him on the bench for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident was caused by a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke PSV's defence.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital.
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he struggles, then he plays fantastically and now this is happening.
He's got an oxygen mask in his locker.
She was crying.
I'm no doctor, but the double fracture rest is six months and you won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's a foul and a red card.
It was a very ugly two-legged surgery.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I am on the road to recovery, I will come back stronger".
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in defeat to PSV
The England midfielder has one more reason to recover to play in the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury".
Everybody's very sad when a player suffers an injury like that.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexico national team against Van Gaal's Netherlands national team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because he didn't mean to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I didn't see the scene.
I could only see the ball, which was going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but he's still holding up.
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task but after seeing the England team selected for the tournament, I don't consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.
I wouldn't rule out a win on the road.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than they did three years ago but they have good spin players on the batting line and the morale is strong; they won't be marked by the events of 2012 but they will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali is evolving as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though he is unknown at the testing level, is an option for attack.
Similar Topics: Adam Lyth left the England Test team and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it's difficult for me to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth into the team.
He played all seven Test matches against two good forwards in tough conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by their results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own selectors.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he gets other opportunities.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when his performance was not up to his potential, and I'm not surprised by that; he's a team man, first and foremost.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes to get a noticeable batsman in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the move.
The only complaint you can have is that England chose Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
And now we have Alex Hales, a batsman I rate highly.
He's a cricketer who has the X factor and who we noticed early on at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was pitched for Moeen to open the batting with Cook, which would lead to an extra spinner keeping four quicks while keeping four, and I have no objection.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this lefty has already proven he's fucked.
Moeen may not have brought success to his home county, Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches 38 as a first drop before entering the Open in 2001.
He wiped out three centuries at once and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is joining the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age -- with a batting average of 31 and a ball average of 35 -- and they might think he's a punt, but there aren't a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He's gonna learn a lot from this tour.
England have also made some changes to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a Test match advisor could be a masterstroke.
He's one of the best players and he's going to bring a lot of experience, given that he's played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they're transmitting messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches don't do the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
These decisions are never made lightly.
The Brexit camp could have a clear advantage if the economy stays calm until 2017
With each passing day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more tangled, even without the brilliant Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader of the Labour Party or TUC bringing serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have their own characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the other day that - plunged into crises similar to the EU's - not all of them being internally provoked - some member states are being fed the UK agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they did not want this either if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that many dull ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before her position is shaken, like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) who have been too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to believe that they will help the English people who are taking pictures, whose energy would be better spent on preventing Scotland from breaking away from the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers might even plan to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The renegotiation was fixed and the UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation.
Europeans know firsthand how capricious Fleet Street can be and how skeptical are the oligarchic media barons who view the EU with skepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our 1973 entry at a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who became famous in the early 1990s when he was Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-evading pickpockets, foreigners who cheated on the phone and the pseudo-non-homes who own most of the major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with an angry gorilla, you have to feed him bananas to distract him from thinking about eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair had made a concession in principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems in danger of embracing Murdoch's 1980s strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but she needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC she took a leave of absence from on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most people who disagree with conservative Anglicism might agree with that.
That's what Hilary Benn, but not a Bennite, said on radio and TV this week, when the boy scout in him struggled not to recognize that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and MPs in the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of what image Corbyn wants to convey -- remember, he sensitized me too -- the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of television and especially in the social media whirlwind, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favourable ticket in Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell has claimed.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes that.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophistry about EU membership - consistent with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistry on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters there - on concessions to Britain when it might all be useless?
The US is already pretty disappointed in the British military's poor performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) team joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their foundation on solid ground or quicksand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.
They said they expected PHE's claims that current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting reported funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding reported to have been received from the tobacco and cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris International.
The arguments on which the panel members were selected were not provided but they include a number of well-known 'leaders' in the production of e-cigarettes, some of whom even claim to finance the industry in the paper.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Head of the Tobacco Control Section of PHE.
The research work produced by the group 'convincingly obscures' the lack of 'strong evidence of harmful effects of most products on most criteria', McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are an encouraging factor for smoking among children or non-smokers are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the department of health at PHE, says that the BMJ claims have been answered in the past.
He said: E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking
One in two people who have smoked their whole life die from this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is and is not in the evidence, especially given the high level of public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Each year, about 80,000 people die from smoking-related illnesses, and the annual costs to the national health system from smoking are up to £2 billion.
By clearly articulating the current evidence - that while e-cigarette use is not risk-free, it is only a fraction of the harmful effects of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

The ads that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the film Amnesty International made against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones! They're not going anywhere!

The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fiery charade, created by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
Important announcement, traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September? says one of the ads, using the London Underground's fonts and branding, with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.

The London Transport Board is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of steering wheels.
One of the spoof ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political work accessible to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists are turning to working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters riding the subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voiceover artist also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the arms fair ad - with an empty space in the Excel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They played around with making a more realistic ad, but by enriching it with animation and strong colors, it was more striking.
'They have done a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,' says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the armament trade fair theme comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the US military regarding AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.
This includes a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists, not salespeople.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a more unusual project, quite "strange", as he calls it, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, and this makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: one on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the orchestra's founder, and one on Monday, in which the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being untouched.
Both shows, performed on the Athenian stage, showed the audience a different way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical music ensemble without a conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, that musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as 'skilled workers'.
They themselves feel they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishism is focused on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
So, we're not talking about music anymore.
So if you look at this world, you have skilled workers on one side, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but has to watch, which is stupid", says David Grimal.
The violinist says that this change in his music came as a result of "musical disappointments" from his solo career.
I was like a top-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my 30s, I found this very depressing, because I didn't find creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So I found no point in going on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at that time nobody was doing anything like this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, didn't want these kinds of projects".
"How do you imagine marketing a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who make up the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the ensemble's 10 years of existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be an obstacle in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex a repertoire we play, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", says Grimal, adding that at the Sunday show "we had 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is "very brave", precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world are present and play three times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition like the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, that breaks down barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu to his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who did French music".
Grimal advocates for a change in the way classical music education is done, believing that "the profession of musician, as organized today, is dying" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it's not going to do any good.
In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not sales representatives.
To me, touring, festivals, concerts, album releases, all of that is great, extraordinary, but only if it's done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it's not free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before joining the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To get into the EU you had to pass sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are serving supermarkets, as is happening in France.
With music, it's the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the reds maybe not very pretty, but when you cut them, they're real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should be back at the center and the institutions and industries that run this system should understand that music doesn't need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and that can be done starting with education policy.
"If we were to consider - as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things about humanity, we would reintroduce it into school, we would reintroduce concerts on television, and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical byproducts", Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, it's something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, first and foremost, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if you want to train a soldier, it has to be one way, if you want to train a musician, it's another thing entirely.
"In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this "soldier" status, overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicists discover at a certain point that they are not soldiers, and that's why they come out of the concert smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a public discussion organized by the Aspen Institute Romania as part of the George Enescu International Festival.
Profile of the man
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international solo violin career, during which he has given regular concerts over the past 20 years on the world's leading classical music stages and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the Orchestre National de Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestre de l'Opéra de Lyon, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Warsaw Symphony, under conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schᅢnwandt, Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruhgosbeck and Peter Andrisson and Peter Evosot, Christian Burrison, Nels Arming.
He has been the recipient of dedications from several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
In addition to his solo career, David Grimal has continued to explore more personal projects.
The freedom that the collaboration with Les Dissonances gave her allowed her to develop her inner universe by venturing into repertoires not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Opera of Dijon.
He taught violin at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many master classes and was a jury member of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
She was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal played a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, and also "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French lutenist Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year's George Enescu International Festival with the Orchestra Les Dissonances, featuring Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances returned to the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the programme was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City is launching the biggest challenge ever for kids: dubbing two characters from the blockbuster "Snow Queen 3D"
You have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, in its latest campaign for enthusiastic and ambitious kids between the ages of 8 and 16 who want to be future stars, Cinema City is looking for "Big Little Voices" and giving them the extraordinary opportunity to dubb two characters from a famous animated film.
While the classic cartoons emphasized the proximity of the voice of the actor to the specifics of the animated character, in recent times, the story also takes into account those who are going to perform the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we're launching a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enter their children in our contest.
They're going to have a special experience because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from 11 to 30 September, Cinema City will organise a pre-selection where 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected to have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is go to the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where they can register their child for the competition and prepare him for the voice challenge.
Then, they have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record himself performing his own version of the dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can be selected to support the challenge: Yellow Feathers 3D, Moon: Guardian of the Moon 3D, Blinky Bill: Koala the Poodle 3D and Mayan Bee 3D.
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and each will play a character in the blockbuster "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx profits are mixed, lower 2016 tax forecasts
FedEx reported disappointing quarterly results as the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to low demand for transportation services and rising costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, down 20 cents from an earlier estimate.
Analysts had been forecasting $10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The decreasing estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, which came into force on 4 January, and higher surcharges for the overland transport of large or heavy parcels, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it still expects to increase profits compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it planned to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% year over year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnating revenues for its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted the FedEx Ground division's results.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher base rates, while the freight division's revenue decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, approximately one hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares had fallen $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the closing was down 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high of 11 June.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank's boardroom, you'll see a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind Janet L. Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues that they must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Federal Reserve has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the U.S. employment rate and maintain price stability.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in an all-too-difficult decision to be announced on Tuesday that will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be unleashed by the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
Even as most data point to a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the federal funds rate - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will look at, said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
I believe, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increasing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them reasons to wait further, she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market instability.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg anticipated a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop in the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, unless policymakers mitigate the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next hike.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised interest rates at this time", Lonski said.
If Fed decision makers were to do this, they would have to act deeply in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.
Other experts said that a rate hike would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed looked set to raise rates by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rise in interest rates this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as total employment.
Wage earnings showed signs of increasing.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of plummeting oil prices.
The economy "can and needs to cope with higher rates given the strain on the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to flip later this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its May record high as investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has receded somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed decision makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of interest rate timing.
Without what's happened in financial markets and news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer at the meeting, said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and they have almost no data to build on after the events in China", Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "tighten" monetary expansion sent shockwaves through global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor progress in other areas but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that the Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a decision-making body that supported the interest rate increase, gave as an example the decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis that affected Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, despite implications for the US development that could only be identified, Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on those cuts.
The Fed should only put financial stability first in a major crisis like the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period is not even close to that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to be in a situation where we fear an interest rate hike because markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double-mandate and does not mention financial stability and until something changes in that regard, I don't think it should take premature action.
Looking for a great Thai-specific market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown
The market/depository opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/depot is a one-stop shop offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, Thai and Asian popular snacks and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even a car district where you have to buy some motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the colors.
If you get hungry from all that shopping, eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor dining area (good, affordable) is close to homes and offers several options for preparations that can be picked up by the package.
What's in stock: do you need anything - anything- Thai?
You probably found it at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat section is big, and so is the fish section - the staff who serve will clean and file the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
A large part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer section, where you will find curry leaves, frozen watermelons and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef balls, pork carcasses, fish steaks, traditional, semi-prepared sausages and more.
Who buys from there: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
The wide colours can accommodate both shopping carts and fork carts.
Fresh durian fruit right next to the house area.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store is likely to be crowded, parking is usually not hard to find.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite Channel Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about the change in party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to broadcast on the subject of the consequences of changes in the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Channel Nine's morning show broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was filmed in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This cruelty of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, versus Today's 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday's audience (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but the numbers were lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
Meanwhile, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is being affected by the tide of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson was able to handle a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing for last night answered resoundingly as "yes".
The X Factor show aired by Seven held on to the position, with 1.136 million viewers, slightly ahead of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night she broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00 to 5:30 p.m.) of the new pop culture show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 and the second half recorded a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in ratings recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will give the Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
Four people have died after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that the police forces used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to using rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are commonly used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country ruled by the central government for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange remarks with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position on the refugee crisis.
We are doing everything we can to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated view.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or armed police.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply the methods of the 1930s", said Victor Ponta.
"The Prime Minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled at the CSAT meeting on Thursday". concluded the Prime Minister.
NHC reports 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low pressure front about 350 miles south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, a new study suggests.
It's still too early to tell if mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight-loss surgery than those who undergo non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote a paper on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, uses various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
The BMI, a unit of measurement of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5-24,9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in people who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in people who received non-surgical diabetes treatment remained almost the same, at 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, 36 percent of those with diabetes were completely cured and 28 percent were partially cured.
In the medical treatment group, by comparison, only 1 percent of subjects had a complete cure and only 2 percent had a partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and LDL-C were generally better in the surgical group, the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal hemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it was about 8%.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes associated with the two types of surgery.
At year five, compared with the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who had surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic outlook for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
This is where this paper is critical, because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when a patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
'I think we are waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously,' she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
'It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,' he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
'It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we must think about long-term solutions to bring about genuine peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries,' he stressed.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved these problems, he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US' violent response generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9/11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who ingested hand detergent in the last four years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, poison control centers in the U.S. have reported an increase of about 400 percent since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, hand-washing cases among children under 12 years of age reported to the center rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more access to these products and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink detergent intentionally and others do so to impress their friends or to respond to social media challenges.
You can watch videos on YouTube that show teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed their mouthwash with alcohol to make a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think it's hurting them", says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types are scented.
Strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers are the most appealing to children.
Hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand sanitizers in accessible places, and if the little ones get to them, that's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-scented hand-wash sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice the legal drinking age for an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was staring and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet wipes or products and to keep hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their teacher by putting antibacterial products in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and has banned it from her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "minor" and took the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the title race is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic - because they were not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now the Ajax ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands, they no longer broadcast Celtic's game summaries; why?"
Because there's no Rangers there.
This isn't just about the Rangers coming back.
It's about the Old Firm.
It's about both teams together and that's where the interest is.
The tension is high in the Old Firm games and it's not just the Scots who want to see these games.
I will change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY DEILLA has accepted that Celtic are fighting hard but the Norwegian boss has promised to change the situation.
The defeat to Malmo and subsequent relegation from the Champions League was followed by defeat to 10-man Aberdeen, now at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: 'Celtic have had their moments before and they will recover'.
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that's how the players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay together now.
Warburton's caution about the January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting he had identified a few targets for January's transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfer windows, insisting he does not want to undermine the unity of Ibrox.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer".
For players transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period when they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do more damage if you bring in players you don't need.
Celtic aiming for Michu after the withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested he may retire at the end of his contract with the Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts facing off with SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was then cancelled - his third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: I have not questioned the integrity, I have not commented on the performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was taken to task after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment", said the striker, adding: "Needless to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic".
The Tannadice Council has confidence in the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence that the management team will turn things around - but agrees that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for his "dirty win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies to claim their seventh successive league victory, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic on a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, cup or league, that has not won games like this".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, to 2,612,000 today.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The authorities' long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It has been almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the last 12 months, we've seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, barring a belated legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will stand in an observation room in the execution chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of the event draws near, I am terrified of the idea.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole death penalty story.
It would provide a unique perspective.
True, journalists can witness executions in America, and because the demands usually exceed the number of seats available, there's a macabre lottery to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will watch the execution with impartiality.
I can't do this.
I would be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection to him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he could have put it better, but he still thinks they're wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if you asked me.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be there to write about it.
He thinks if he dies, publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be joining me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series that I made.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely that he's not guilty of murder.
I think for sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm gonna watch him die from that perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it is like to watch a man I love die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody claimed that his Victoria Racing stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from racing.
He launched an attack on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were running a personal campaign against him, the final straw being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for the racing business and that he's put himself in a difficult position when it comes to Lidari's positive test for cobalt, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about the spy claims and didn't want to be like the "fox that never reaches the grapes".
'I wasn't going to say anything about it and I was silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly blows up,' Moody said.
It's known that he continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go head-to-head, and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying to give them the best.
The moment they start to think that's not happening, I have to quit coaching.
At that point, I'll have to figure out what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department was trying to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I will say if asked - and offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the work there", Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, he thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current RVL chairman and Bernard Saundry, current RVL CEO, knew at the time and they know today.
Am I supposed to think this is personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start to have a backbone and be able to hold people outside of trainers accountable for what's happening in the industry?
Am I a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
Maybe they should take my license and put me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now might make them think about that option.
But I've reached a point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and I'll make him make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The coach's frustration grew with the lengthy investigation into the cobalt testing Lidari was involved in and the elimination led him to say he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice was applied to the horses' legs, which violated the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I must take full responsibility for this", he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on her foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race-day treatment of applying poultice, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
'We all understand the need for rules but it has gone too far,' Moody said.
The hit-and-run driver at the Cobram crash site has been arrested.
Police have arrested a man following a collision with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and a hit-and-run.
The cyclist was flown by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
Monday, a 50-year-old man turned himself in to Shepparton police.
Looks like he's gonna be charged with hit-and-run, failing to provide first aid and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy answers to his opponents in the wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of his team's tackling tactics "distorted topics" brought to the table by the NRL's top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm players to take the team by storm in the nervous win by the Storm in Friday night's final in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a light reference to the Storm after his team's win in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifier on Saturday night, calling the game a "demonstration" of rugby league and saying the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to defend his team's tackling tactics and stated that players simply focused on "contact" when scoring.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two prominent coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And it doesn't stop there - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee you we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, just that in the last six weeks we've really focused on contact in the playoffs and so we've changed the situation.
Trent's been in this job for three years and obviously he's got a great team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his point by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was", Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about the black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially because of the young fast-paced midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought up this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when they thought of the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm-Roosters game was a more scoreless contest than the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more tries, that means exciting game?
Or does exciting mean taking breaks and not scoring?
I have plans.
If they're talking about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
The Storm have the weekend off because they have earned the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at home in the final of next Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images featuring children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
She looked at her phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "lure pedophiles" onto the Internet before he pretended to be a cop to scare them.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: He stated that it's an addiction - that it's addicted to scare people.
He admitted he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to impersonate a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and about asking the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure her.
She said she lost her mind when she drank and that she wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she called out to her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14th, Hogg, aged 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of making or taking indecent photographs of child subjects, and violated the terms of his parole on January 25th of this year and failed to appear in court at his March 24th court appearance.
Defence counsel Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg be removed from the sex offender registry because it can be argued that this offence did not involve a significant sexual aspect.
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October, citing social issues.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody pending appearances for other cases.
He was put on the sex offender registry before the sentence was passed.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of steps.
He was not hurt but footage of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening to yell at Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent from a hidden number but it is titled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats made to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is going to make 30,000 layoffs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's restructuring efforts and cost reductions in the services sector.
This year, HP will be publicly listed in two companies, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The planned disposals will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
These restructurings will give the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure, said Meg Whitman, HP's president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP is today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to the new way of doing business", Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions to enterprises.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with a business in electrical equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been called the "cradle of Silicon Valley", splits.
HP went through a massive reorganization to accommodate the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second largest computer maker and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that firms that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the show is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching a 15-year high.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, challenging the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if a patient is surrounded by enough friends "in a healthy mood", their chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to be effective, it must first be accessible.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediacy of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, fun-loving, successful personality, even when in reality, isolation is what dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- that affect our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it brought that idea to the forefront.
The characters were not defined by their jobs but by their personalities, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments of watching football in their comfortable armchairs, and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be able to associate with this situation, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ...my role in listening to suicidal and depressed people showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.
Often, people who come to us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying "do it yourself" is powerful, and so is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about your problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term psychological coping mechanisms.
The show highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, outward intervention over the phone helps people in desperate times, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you're attending this weekend's FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with full-scale filming to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship might make.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG to a win over Swedish side Malmo.
Here's the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group stage with a reassuring 2-0 win over Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut for PSG, giving the French champions the lead despite missing a number of chances before securing the lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team's goal is not only to qualify in the top but also to improve their quarter-final run in each of the last three tournaments.
But although they scored, Laurent Blanc's pupils were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering the goal opportunity after being replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable gap to the next class, even if there are still aspects we need to improve throughout the season", says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic recovered from injury in one of Paris' three substitutions, with a 2-2 draw at home to Ligue 1 side Bordeaux at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine attacking midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and proved it when he slammed into Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before incredibly kicking over Johan Wiland in the long right corner of the goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to win with a snap of their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine nationals, with a five-man defence and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot that went over Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down a few times, giving a few useless passes and unfinished interceptions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five tries in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani right after the resumption of play.
Ibrahimovic proved much more adept at supporting his teammates, however, his pass being the one Di Maria sent in a deflected shot by Wiland across the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of play, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the replacement David Luiz kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi was nullified by a goal in extra time.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were one class over and that The last match we played in the Champions League was in December last year.
Since then, I've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played a great game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodities exchange, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, a London-listed company, said it had sold £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is grappling with plummeting commodity market prices as China's slowing economic activity affects demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential right of subscription has increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trading.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore disclosed the sale of $2.5 billion of shares as part of wider plans to cover nearly one-third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, 2.4% below the closing price on Tuesday.
It sold 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
Xi insists on broader expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open more to the outside world to fuel growth.
China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening-up policies, Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening-up and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make way for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of SOEs to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying the sectors and activities in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider opening of the market.
State authorities will also loosen controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
The declaration also states that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up the state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened up to private investment.
The State authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-invested companies and provide them with better services, according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called 'green cards', streamlining requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the right to practise for lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
Education unions dissatisfied with government proposal to raise wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education unions have not yielded any results, with the Government proposing a 10% wage increase from 1 December, with pay on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanting a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
We are not satisfied with the government's proposal today, otherwise we would not have been able to convene the heads of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than we expected.
"In fact, this 10 percent is the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016", said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: In the future, health and education are going to be the areas where we're going to invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will be held in which government representatives will also participate to present the proposal for a wage increase to the representatives of the confederations in the country, with the trade unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Wages Act to Parliament as soon as possible so that it can come into force on December 1.
The law provides for a 25% increase in the salaries of the education system from the total increase of 70%, the increase provided for in the document to be phased in over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unionists to pay in full the court sentences in 2016.
The migrant crisis: tragedy in the Aegean
At least 22 migrants drowned Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after the boat they were on sank.
Among the victims are 11 women and five children, reports AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was heading for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had rescued 249 people from the boat, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than it could carry, so it sank.
The route has become a popular one recently for migrants seeking to escape war and hardship in countries like Syria and Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 flight attendants for being overweight, the airline announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist", The Washington Post reports.
The mass layoff is the latest in a decade-long battle between the company and the busier flight attendants.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s when Air India started using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine flight attendants deemed "exceptionally overweight" as this "may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility needed to perform emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won, and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed", a company spokesman explained.
A star football player lectures Gigi Becali on his decision
A star football player is giving Gigi Becali a lesson in promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount of money, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Paul Papp Academy will be operating in Dej, with local kids being expected for a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy to have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without having to worry about material things at practice.
They have only one concern: to play football as well as possible.
The technical details shouldn't be their concern.
They need to put their talent to good use.
This is what Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them", football player Papp told dejeanul.ro.

The whole party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, at the PSD Congress this decision will be formalized.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it through a resolution of Congress, we will do that.
There's not gonna be any excitement about it.
"There are no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone uncertainty of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister", Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
PSD announced when it will hold the congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message be given if the government is to continue or if the party decides to go into opposition.
I 'll announce on Monday whether I 'm running for congressional office .
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I'll weigh in on Monday after the Executive Committee if the date of the convention is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the party leadership", Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD National Standing Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about announcing his candidacy was related to his file, Dragnea said he had no such problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my party colleagues to announce or not a candidacy when the date for the Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation", said Dragnea.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11th, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at the customs exchange with immigrants hiding in the TIR
Two Sri Lankans were spotted Monday at Bors customs while trying to illegally cross the border, hidden in the semi-trailer of a car driven by an Italian national.
Investigations revealed that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police said.
At the specific checkpoint, border guards noticed a large travel bag containing personal belongings for several people in the cabin of the truck, which led them to carry out a thorough check of the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered two male individuals hidden in the semi-trailer of the van, among the plastic crates.
The verification showed that the persons concerned, two men aged 28, are Sri Lankan nationals and asylum seekers in Romania.
"At the inquiries, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, which they did by contacting a conventional driver, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to take them to their destination, where they were to receive 2,000 euros per person", the Border Police statement said.
The two migrants were charged with "criminal offence of attempting to cross the state border fraudulently".
Also, Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian national who was driving a Renault Magnum registered in Romania, transporting plastic crates for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Court with a motion for pre-trial arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians in their relationships: Men versus women
Most Romans are content with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the visit to Romania by John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents were 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of their relationship.
"However, 18 percent reported being 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in their relationship, and another 18 percent reported being 'appropriate,'" the study concluded, according to a statement sent to Ziare.com on Tuesday.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analysed separately.
So 28 percent of men are very satisfied, 39 percent are satisfied, 17 percent are satisfied, 6 percent are very dissatisfied, and 8 percent are slightly dissatisfied.
For women, 33% were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at satisfaction, we see that men are more satisfied.
In terms of neutral, we see a two percent difference.
"Similarly in the very dissatisfied situation, the biggest difference is in the slightly dissatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent", the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The study authors also report that "Romanians need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between 1 June and 1 September on 1,369 people, with a margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe has once again become a disgrace
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe was "embarrassed" after Monday's failure of a Brussels ministerial meeting on the allocation of refugees within the European Union.
"Yesterday (Monday evening), Europe was once again shamed", said Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, at a press conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting EU structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday failed to reach an emergency agreement on the mandatory resettlement of 120,000 refugees requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of Europe's worst migrant crises since 1945.

What 's going on with Coach Darren Cahill ?
Simona Halep is faced with a crucial decision for her career, as she must choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked together this year in the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician only joining the romance on major tournaments.
Simona had nothing but praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to prevail against the capricious athlete.
But the Adidas program is due to expire at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a solid contract or drop the partnership.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and we see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer", Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, he's asking for a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not like to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions Tour, in Singapore.
It wasn't normal. I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former national team coach confessed that he did not get along with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he offered the Federation chief a substantial raise in salary to stay, but was turned down.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the Nationals.
I was sorry then, I was leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a coach, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with my predecessors at the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions about me in the press.
It didn't change me because it was really hard at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in between.
I kept working, everything went very well, and he probably changed his mind, too.
But I wanted to go.
If they really wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract extension.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group", Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, despite the team's good results in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Other, of circular cross-section, of iron or steel
Hungarian police have deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants trying to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary erecting a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 policemen and two children were injured in the clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken in two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means", said the security adviser to the Hungarian prime minister, Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control the crowd with water cannons and tear gas who threw plastic bottles, rocks and pieces of floor.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have also added their border security forces.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest has suspended the crossing at the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to stop the flow of migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that besides the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia he will erect one on the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the erection of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease that a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was drunk, he could barely stand on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he had not consumed alcohol, he was clearly intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's a secret alcoholic,'" he says, according to the Mirror.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, just didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there".
'It was awful, I couldn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, though doubting him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick on his mind most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit, even though the night before he had only had one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body causes all the carbohydrates he consumes to ferment into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's disease was his own wife.
There's no cure yet, but since he gave up carbs, Nick hasn't had an episode like this.
He smashed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A man in South Korea destroyed his Mercedes S63 in protest at the services he received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of service, reports BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the clip went online, much to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that endangered his life and that of his family.
His anger arose when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem as agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage Romania is undergoing in its efforts to modernize the immigration management process on national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims at managing immigration effectively, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action reflecting policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States in Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures are envisaged for the unitary and coherent management of situations arising from the possible influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
"The Romanian authorities will help to create a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or that may harm national security", the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that may influence immigration and asylum, including the continuation of the conflict situation in Syria, the re-ignition of the conflict in Iraq, the continuation of an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the continuation and intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls on the legality of the stay of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania for third-country nationals meeting the employment needs of the labour force, facilitating access for third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for fields and professions identified as deficient.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties on the measures taken by the Member States to implement the 2015 Action Plan.
Romania, in a European top for labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to the employer's personnel expenditure.
Thus, between April and June 2015, total labour costs increased by 1,9% in the European Union and by 1,6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU in labour cost growth
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7,9%), Romania (7,7%), Bulgaria (6,8%), Estonia (5,5%) and Lithuania (4,3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (-2,9%) Cyprus (-1,2%) and Italy (-0,4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania in the period from April to June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in hourly labour costs in industry and services by 7,9% and 7,6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an increase of 5,8% in the hourly cost of labour.
The TVR management's activity report, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks being fired
The culture committees of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for the year 2014.
17 MPs voted to reject the report, one against (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Standing Bureaux meeting.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be a debate.
"I think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly", said the chair of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgi Severin.
He added that it was 'common sense' for the management of TVR to be present at this meeting, given that no representative of the management of TVR was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was sent to the members of the Council last night, about an hour before we didn't know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Reunified Bureaux, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I think the moment you're summoned, you're being budgeted, paid for by public taxes and you're summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you don't like it alive.
"Because it is your duty, you are in an institution under the authority of Parliament", Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that the meeting discussed the financial aspects of the institution on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they didn't pay off the historic ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's fault that the agreement with the banks and the tax was lost, it is a clear management problem", Severin said.
He added that after the report was rejected by the plenary assembly, elections for a new Board of Directors would follow, and that the latter would elect the institution's Director General.
I don't know who's going to be proposed for this position.
Miracles will not happen.
It is important that political decisions are made to make this institution work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there's gonna be a genius who's gonna stand in line here and fight.
I hope that the decision-makers, the full Parliament, through their vote, will choose with great reason the people who will lead the TVR.
It needs to be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it's going to be, if you ask me what qualities he has to have - good sense in his attitude towards employees because it's a quagmire of petitions coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you get these referrals 50, 60, 70, something's rotten and we're talking about a financial situation that's a disaster", concluded the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee.
Although he did not appear before Parliament, TVR's President and CEO Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV charge, that HG 978/2003 on the public service television charge be amended and supplemented in order to update the provisions in the light of technological developments and to regulate the procedure for monitoring the payment of the TV charge and the detection of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
It also wants a provision to extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become agents of SRTv for the collection of the TV charge by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In its opinion, a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on collection should be set.
Stelian Tanase is asking for the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC to be reduced from 15% to 3%, and for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in order to be able to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sporting events - the World Cup, the Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will become insolvent in the coming months, given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and that wage rights are honoured as a matter of priority over any other obligation.
TVR's administration has made constant efforts to reduce its personnel and TV production costs.
'This reduced travel and other costly activities, renegotiated a number of commercial contracts and closed TVR News at the end of July', the letter from the chairman of TVR states.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by his own efforts alone.
'Without the support of the State institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later find itself unable to fulfil its public mission,' the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion in a case involving damages of approximately 600,000 euros, which is under judicial review.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL with his mother in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter Agathe.
The investigations showed that, in order to evade the payment of taxes and duties to the State budget, the representatives of a company specialising in the provision of security services had set up a criminal network consisting of several companies, through which sham transactions were exposed.
'In fact, the company's accounts would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which in reality were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by about EUR 600,000,' the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Seici have decided the fate of Sanmartean
The heads of the Al-Ittihad club have decided the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab media is reporting that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of the Ladislaus Boloni contractor, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays starter-by-player and does it well.
The bosses also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give him up.
There was a chance he could have brought in another player, a lot better, but nothing came of it.
"There were several talks, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing came to fruition", Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice president of the Court of Auditors
The Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded in favour and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The representatives of the PNL were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
Moreover, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment to this position and announced that they would challenge it to the CCR, given that he has a DNA file but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Accounts does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will take up the position of Vice-President of the Audit Authority at the Court of Auditors, left vacant after Ioan Anton was dismissed, following a Constitutional Court decision in September 2014, which found that he had been appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors I 've ever seen .
As Bradley Cooper is set to play a chef in the movie "Burnt", the actor has made a revelation his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said that he grew up mostly in the kitchen: "I've worked most of my life as a cook".
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he continued in the same way.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian origin, so his entire childhood he cooked with his Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make five-year plans, "not even two".
"It's not motivating at all for me to have a map", he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you", he said, but he said that his childhood dream had come true.
But at the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, following the example of Clint Eastwood, who started directing at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrollable slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday morning the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that Hungarian political decision-makers are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his temper and, with his irrational statements, offends the whole of Hungary", the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians don't say such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in Romania's domestic politics", the Hungarian foreign minister added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of some high-ranking Hungarian government officials, who in his opinion "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government officials.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta wrote on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he was in favour of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that brutality and aggressive laws would not solve the problem.
The barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we are seeing in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these very goals and values!" stressed the Romanian head of government.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "mere lies", saying they were unsuitable for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The Hungarian foreign minister also mentioned on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and lying remarks" were connected to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and I always say is that I'm against xenophobic speech, the idea of closing borders, that everyone who comes in is a terrorist, is medieval nonsense, and I'm totally against that approach.
If we can get more, we will, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not like our neighbors Hungarians, with the bat and the stick.
"I don't agree with that", the Romanian chief executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to begin preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to the Romanian border, to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta declared that Hungary's decision to build a border fence solves nothing about the refugee problem and "takes Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the crane collapse in Mecca?
Saudi authorities say the Saudi giant Binladin Group, owned by Osama bin Laden's family, is "partly responsible" for Friday's crane crash at the Great Mosque of Mecca that killed 107 people.
A commission of inquiry found the company had "failed to comply with safety regulations", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, reports the BBC.
The company's executives have been ordered to leave the country pending the completion of the investigation into this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaeda terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, crashed into the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
The accident killed 107 people and injured nearly 400.
How Hagi silenced the protesters
Widely considered the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, unable to perform in his new position.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, the Stars and Galatasaray, Hagi took over the role of coach at Futuro Constanta, the team he runs.
Exactly one year into his reign, the King has proven he can turn a team that was struggling to save itself from relegation into a top-tier team.
Thus, after a year, the future has recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The score is one of a top team, beating in European cups.
Things took an even better turn for Futuro this season, as the team finished second in Ligue 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The forward also has the best attack in Ligue 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than twice as many as the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young players, and in the recent period names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared in the starting team.
The club's policy made Futuro a team to watch for teams abroad, so Hagi sold this summer for €1.5 million - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - €1 million) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - €500,000).
Next to the Star, the Future are the only profitable team in League One, according to the Commercial Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played like a small country so far.
It's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't claim to be treated like the seventh EU country.
Large countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the board of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea pointed out that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress and that purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people bring".
But there are masses that have turned on, and we can't turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Guinea, we are in a very emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must change: 'Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation of today.'
Where are we on the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the odds were he'd get the votes he needed.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the principle of unanimity applied in the JHA and any Member State could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, where the EC takes the initiative, and the Council approves it with a vote of 55% of the Member States, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there have been backlashes in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel's policy of openness and they didn't want it to come across in many countries as a "EU is sending us migrants on our heads" kind of reaction.
So they delayed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for Schengen governance and we're likely to see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external Schengen border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the old Schengen system its limits.
Maybe he'll drop the Dublin principle, which says migrants are the responsibility of the first country they enter, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece falls, you can't say it's Greece's business forever.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they ever get there.
Because the problem remains: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European countries will take up the migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It'll probably end up in one of the filtering centers in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem has no simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries with no experience at all, like Romania, where the migrant problem will increase xenophobic sentiment.
What is certain is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says only 10% have made it, winter is hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect a wave next year maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't see it as catastrophic from a media standpoint.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Do you think there is a place where the integration of large groups from a non-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're all enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
It's left an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
To create a fortress Europe is an illusion.
The mechanisms for integration into European societies must be explored.
There's been some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, to stop having one foot in Europe and one foot in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through arranged marriages.
But we have to separate the immediate problem of these people from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed to integrate in the long term doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people bring.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that you're going to rebuild the country overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions are found, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders are being closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're all free to move around, but we're all having our own problems.
In the face of such a wave, you can't do that, because some countries can't cope.
When there's a surge of emotion like this, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we don't have any more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
There's a wave of public emotion that's moving in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We've got a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians back home under pressure to be manly.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets emotional.
Once the public emotion passes, we'll return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that's not just for people, but for goods.
This is the real European single market.
And I don't think Europeans are going to give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is another.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation of now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country that thinks if you pull the hat over your eyes and plug your ears, the subject disappears.
Faced with the reality of the migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your problem with the small country.
We did that, it's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't claim to be treated like the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we're not talking about the quality of them now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that Romanians' appetite for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says it's probably a good thing we haven't entered yet.
So we go from desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
Which is not a reason to stay out of Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become a shared responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules for deporting those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its focus from Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia is behaving in a frustrated power.
She thinks being a great power means confusing the Americans and the Europeans.
In that respect, yes, there is a connection.
Without the Putin regime's military and financial effort, the Assad regime probably would have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to have it collapsed before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years there was a battle between the Assad regime and secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by Gulf countries and the West.
Then the Islamic State came up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia may have complicated things, but it can't be part of the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you're only powerful if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin's probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to push the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers don't come because people aren't convinced he can somehow solve the issues he created.
But I don't agree with theories that these people are being driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin more powerful than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network's representatives are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder and CEO, announced on his account that the button will be available soon, reports the New York Times blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button would show a shade of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his ad raised the concern that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the times when someone posts on his account an important life event and someone else will "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy for something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it's not very comfortable for people to "like" current events like the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable liking that post", the Facebook rep pointed out.
The new Facebook button version was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social media", Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page where the article was posted.
"I'm going to dislike the dislike button", he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she claims, the election campaign in America is coming up, and a "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted just 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands who have flocked to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency in the course of the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different", said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration law was imposed, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
Moreover, over 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid registration and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" County Council headquarters is about to fall.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investment made here in recent years to move the institution is about to collapse because it's been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went bankrupt during the construction.
The headquarters of the County Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up collapsing by itself.
A year and a half after the building was to be completed, the work on strengthening and re-functioning the building was not even half done.
A final stage in the building's epic was consummated yesterday when the National Dispute Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract to carry out the technical design for the work that was still to be executed.
The original draft was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the constructor and the interruption of the works, negotiations were launched without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, which was to update the technical design and then organise a new tender for the works.
'The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, as the CJ considered that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage,' summed up Răzvan Timofciuc, CJ's public relations representative.
The CJ's decision to suspend the direct negotiations was challenged by Impex Romcatel.
The court in Iasi referred the complaint to CNSC, which dismissed it as being overdue.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility of challenging the CNSC decision before the Court of Appeal only after a final judgment has been delivered by the latter, and the possibility of finding another designer can be considered.
Thus, the building's reinforcement could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the reworking of the technical design should not take long, but we need to get to a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be challenged or not", Timofciuc said.
The work to strengthen the former headquarters of the Police Chestnut began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012 after work of RON 4,5 million had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded to Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of RON 1.5 million had been made.
The work has been completed so far at a rate of approximately 50%.
Initially, the works to strengthen, re-functionalise and attic the building had been valued at RON 7,7 million.
"Got it, I'm saying it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Land Registry
One of the employees involved in the scandalous registry file signed a plea agreement for probation.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by former boss, Narciza Nedelcu.
A consultant from the Office of Land Registry and Property Publicity (OCPI) in Iasi, accused by the DNA in a corruption case, has admitted his crimes.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Tribunal Iasi, the judges determining to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was charged with intellectual forgery in the continuing form and agreed to serve two years of suspended prison sentence, as well as community service.
As regards the facts alleged against Dasca­lu, the prosecutors stated that, as an adviser to the Land Registry Office, he and other colleagues 'wrongly prepared several acceptance minutes concerning the service contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I. Iași with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro SRL, SC Agencia Cadastre de Cadastre e Topografia SRL and PFA Lipasa Ștefan, who unreally attested that the contracted services were performed in full, even though they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. Iași'.
Recently, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, and other former or current employees of OCPI were brought to trial in this case, the charges being the settlement of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
The damage is in excess of RON 300,000.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women's national handball team for Olympic qualification costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday at a press conference that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of forks, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament", Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic demands on the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a secondary coach, a doctor, two masseurs, a goalkeeper coach, a gymnast, head of the delegation.
They asked us to get our qualifications for some things, specifically physical training materials, that we'd never heard of.
All of this to get to the Olympics, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make a performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with training.
"The teams we are fighting with have these materials and have had them for some time", said Dedu, who mentioned that they are trying to get the necessary sums to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH President also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure problem and it's shameful to be calling into question a European gymnastics championship.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world, entire Olympic neighborhoods were built in two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beautician's landmark.
The same was true in London, where the 2012 Olympic Games were a success, also in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition", Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the hosting of a major competition.
For me it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaţu went civilized with a project, the people agreed in principle, but it became very clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new arena in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
"So we have all the openness, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure", the FRH official explained.
The former great handballer avoided assessing the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be reserved in the forecasts, that if they do not fulfill they turn against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all the members of the Romanian squad are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to get two victories: "We are ready".
Both my colleagues and I are running the engines at full speed.
We've been training to give our best performance in the last four games.
Everyone's going to have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are tough and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But for sure, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the culmination of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and we come home with good results.
"We want you to be proud that a few players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolour", Macovei said.
The Romanian national team coach, Lynn Howells, who is in his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me, it's an amazing experience.
It's very important for me that at every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraş, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the top of the event.
"These boys started playing in the Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who have set out to realize a dream", Dumitraş said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will advance to Group D, with the following matches scheduled: against France on 23 September in London; against Ireland on 27 September in London; against Canada on 6 October in Leicester; against Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London with the England-Fiji match in Group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at Al.I. Cuza University

Registration runs until 30 September and those wishing to request more information can do so by calling 0742.027.153 or by e-mailing studenticultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei to the "S. Spiridon" Hospital in Iasi in the budget amendment
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The hospital "Sv. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary correction, about RON 14 million.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in modernisation and refurbishment works of some clinics, as well as in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
The health unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, a new radiology machine, six surgical kits, six appropriately equipped ATI beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other equipment necessary for the medical procedure.
On the other hand, RON 5 million of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and landscaping of the "Grand Ars".
From the money from the budget amendment, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization work in the main trunk.
"In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving work from the walkway that links the UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure decent transportation of the patient from the UPU to neighboring clinics", the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in its courtyard the dermatology clinic in Tatarasi, which it will organise in the outpatient setting, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area of outpatient allergology, haematology and endocrinology and will have approximately 30 beds.
The coward, made fun of by RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Fate of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After our experience, neither I nor my wife want to set foot in your town again.
Unwittingly, they were hit with the wrong information in the flyers, the rudeness of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a "so the law says" fine.
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, they stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a leaflet with the RATP routes.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iasi.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Since there were no tickets in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by text message.
No one told them this service no longer exists.
Confident of the leaflet, they boarded a bus and tried to text the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers showed up.
They said the job had been out for two years and it was announced in the press that it was canceled.
How would I know what was in the local press, coming here the night before I visited town?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they can do is give us one ticket instead of two.
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting the gendarmerie stand and giving statements there!" says Ovidio.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I filed a complaint with RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, I'm not exaggerating, but the point is, I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and were remanded in custody
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal of Iasi.
The first sentence of the trial was heard in a closed session in which the seven youths accused of molesting an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the hearing itself began, one of the Iasi judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for an abstention, which was granted by his colleagues at the court.
The Magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was President of the Criminal Section, and on 9 April he accepted a challenge by four of the defendants, ordering their house arrest.
The case is currently being heard by a panel consisting of Magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, Judge Dan Anton also abstained on the grounds that his daughter was in a cohabiting relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui rapists should remain in pre-trial detention.
The young people will remain in detention for at least 30 days, when judges will re-examine their release.
The next hearing will be held at the Court of Appeal in Iasi on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iasi, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the district of Păcurari, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco van carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car that had left Canta Street and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was coming from the end of the road.
The car entered Iasi through here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi through the stables, then on the belt road.
They shortened the trip by a few miles.
Immediately after impact, the arresting escort called another transport to pick up the prisoners.
A car from the Maximum Security Penitentiary in Iasi was sent to the scene shortly afterwards, which took the seven prisoners to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrested people rushed out, two by two.
'The incident was not reported to the police because the drivers of the two cars had agreed amicably on the damages to be paid,' said Chief Commissioner Madalin Ţăranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and loudly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize are, in themselves, a small number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, of about 1500 people, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle in our towns, the chances of their rapid integration into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by intruders and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The failure to integrate the gypsies is just one banal example.
Besides, governments of all stripes have been unable to absorb European funds, build modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent health care, clean up the street dirt, create well-paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they're fleeing from?
But what is most surprising is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is handled.
We are first struck by the bellicose hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, which are most generous in sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably afraid someone will steal his national identity.
Finally, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, while they cite only the horrors of war as their reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination for their exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Well, not all refugees are Syrians, and there's no war in Pakistan.
The simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed is also to be derided.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the political correctness book, they call for peace and investment in the countries of origin of migrants.
But Romania is at peace and even some foreign capital enters the national economy from time to time - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, divided and outdated construction.
I deplored that Romania was not able to invent a country project, but here is that the EU also has no plan for the future.
And improvisation and threats do nothing.
What good is the EU, then, if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question by waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, depletion of resources, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
The destination, practically, imposed
The concession tender shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for a concession for 10 years.
The building has a useful floor area of 134 m2, on two rough levels.
CJ accepts only those destined for the building as literary cafés, libraries or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at EUR 68,300, with an opening bid of EUR 6,830 per annum, with a bidding step of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and permanently and fully cover the costs of rehabilitating the building, in accordance with the technical design to be drawn up.
'The Club Pogor building is in a state of advanced deterioration due to the fact that during the period when the public catering unit was operating in these premises and even after its evacuation, no regular repair and maintenance work was carried out as is normally required during the operation of a building,' the tender documentation states.
The club's concession bids are expected by September 18.
Two brothers from Toméști swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two children, ages 9 and 11 respectively, from Tomé, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the hospital "Santa Maria" in Iasi.
They're in stable condition, according to the doctors.
A date that breaks your heart.
At 20 he received a brave gift: his biological parents.
Lost in a hospital in obscure conditions in the darkness of the 1990s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was loosely regulated, a young outsider, now a beautiful blonde girl, was reunited the other day in Iași with her biological parents from a county village, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old this year, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of giving their beloved daughter a stunning and brave gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to learn about her murky past.
The "Iasi Journal", which has been assisting the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, has witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporting, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa in the Isle of Man, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
My parents began to disagree at home, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
She stopped the girl, and I didn't know anything since.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late", recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pascani, and at the same time the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives were about to be forever separated.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After the hospital, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and when her father returned, he could not find her.
It must have been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She must have thought she was abandoned", relates a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, which then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but couldn't.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl was almost two years old, the time it took for the adoption proceedings.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our daughter.
"It was as if my wife had given birth to her", says smiling Salvador, the adoptive father, as he grasps her frail hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued the search separately, each wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Rustinoasa, but he received no answer where his child could be.
The police then told her that she may have died, but in Iași the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the court that she was in Italy, in Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I never had.
We prayed to God that he was okay.
I thought about her all these years, but there were no ways to walk around, to find her.
"It's hard", says Crina's biological mother with tears in her eyes.
But even as the years passed, the parents in Rustinoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was a kid when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania", says Crina excitedly.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March this year, Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Centre of Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, who explained to her Salvadore's desire to find Crina's biological family.
And the searches started with just one name.
Following the request we received from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had only one name, Balkan Costica, then the locality, Rustosa.
Soon I had a job with the town hall there, and I could ask if there was a place by the name.
They gave me some clues, only the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father", explains Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costică and Alina, especially since each had a different home.
We started the process sometime in March, and in June and July we completed identifying the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided to have a first meeting in September", Romică Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costică saw their lost face for the first time in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could hardly hold back his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
He barely even had a word with the people around him.
A week before the date, he couldn't sleep much.
He was all excited, shaking.
"It's something to see your child after all these years", says a granddaughter, who also came with Rustinoasa's Rib.
Crina's reunion with her mother and biological brother
In conversations with his daughter, who is about to study at a prestigious university in Italy, Costica Balcan told her, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to his village, she should come quietly: she could give him some sheep, goats, so that he could find a boy from the village and start a household.
My mother is also very emotional, she cries, and she can hardly believe that this could happen to her.
I'm really excited.
I didn't think anything like this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking about it all these years, I've hoped, but I never thought I could be like this.
There are very high emotions.
If he could just forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond", says Alina, Crina's mother, with tears streaming down her cheeks, while holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
She's still hiding her tears of joy in it, because she'll soon see her face again after all this bitter weather.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be 20 in just a few days, this month, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
She thinks they're young, but now before the date she tries to gather her thoughts, because she has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me after all.
It'll be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a good memory with them, because now there is so much to talk about", Crina confides.
First family reunion in Iasi
In the Union Square, under the early autumn sky, the family from Ruginoasa reunites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, graduating high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It's no longer divided by borders or countries, but only by a barrier: language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian restaurant owner in the center of Iasi, they passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind ever held, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It's the first event of its kind organized, with such an emotional charge, and I'm glad it's a success.
We at the Center have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who use drugs, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give something good back to the society.
"If I am asked to attend another event like this, I will do it with great pleasure", says Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Centre in Iasi, smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walk away telling their story.
They are understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with arms on the foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The camps of the PSD branch in Ischia have concluded a truce with a gun at their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, lasting from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats in Iasi will send him a full list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from over, the internal war within the party seems to have taken only a pause to allow the combatants to draw their breath.
Dragnea did not issue an ultimatum.
He sent a very simple message and a very timely one in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we will remain in the existing structure", said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing definite was settled.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the post of president of the county branch of the PSD.
The shortlist of possible candidates for the main post in the Iasi branch of the party includes State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazăr, County Councillor Vasile Câtea and the interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could be added to them.
A variant considered is the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
By statute, even on election day, you can run for office, and it wouldn't surprise anyone if it did.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Office and all the new leadership structures", said Câtea.
Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the county branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is on leave until September 29, however, the preparation of the elections will be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu said the discussions of the last few days had led to "a partial consensus".
There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached to support a unified team to deal with the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of the candidate for the presidency of the PSD Iași, the list remains open", Stanciu commented.
A judge in Iasi has rejected the case of the Vaslui rapists on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal of Iasi.
The Vasluians sentenced to between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments today regarding their release, after the court of origin, the Vaslui Court, ordered their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The case was filed in the Court of Appeal late last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton filing a motion to dismiss, which was granted by his colleagues.
Anton claimed that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the cohabitant of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silvius Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the highest penalty in this case.
How the Judges Reasoned
At the end of last week, the judge at the Vaslui Court who convicted the seven young men gave the reasons for the sentence.
In his reasoning, the judge spoke of the defiant reaction of the defendants and their supporters, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
'The Court finds that after the placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, a measure restricting liberty but not depriving of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, their families and local supporters, there was a strong feeling of indignation at the local and national level about the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are tried under a less restrictive measure,' the reasoning of the Vasli Court of Justice states.
The magistrates also dismissed the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial claimed that the girl they raped was not a "church door".
'The Court emphasises that the moral character of the person harmed is irrelevant, a point which the defendants have sought to highlight in their defenses, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be infringed under any pretext,' the statement of reasons states.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they enjoyed in the past decades cannot continue in the years to come.
By Saturday probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering how much we can be affected by the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing Labour leader since the war.
An avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and of the terrorist movements Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost a favorite of the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the kind of things that Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he faced the real world and the economic legality.
The new Labour leader's economic programme includes massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some may wonder why the solution of printing money is not adopted by the whole world, we would then have a general world prosperity!
Sure, we can tax the bankers with blood, you become kind of the left's enemy of the service, but as we've seen so many times in the past, not just in the former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande's terms.
The extra sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, uncovered promises of populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher famously observed, "The trouble with socialism is that at some point you run out of other people's money".
Few give Jeremy Corbyn any real chance of ever becoming Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in beliefs as the new party leader anyway, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the overall workforce and extensive automation has created a massive need for highly skilled labour in industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that's shaking the foundations of the EU, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide to leave the Union after the referendum, which is due to take place before 2017, the symbolic loss of capital for the whole European project and the deep rifts created within it by the Euro crisis and now by refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
The more so because for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin was increasingly becoming the dominant player anyway).
It is true that British business, the City, are strong advocates of the country remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is not the same as the past.
There's a lot of resentment, which is growing in intensity even these past few weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as we had a sample of even recently in the speech of Jean-Clude Juncker, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening as electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration and at the same time Eurosceptic groups is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negative emotional climate has reached a higher level than ever before.
Hence the conclusion the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on cold calculation based on the national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in politics today.
However, Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is to be expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of the interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric on the frustrations built up in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue in the same way in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that took into account only the political ambitions of integration, not the capacity and readiness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to rule anything out in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancusi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
"Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about in the whole world.
But there's something about his reputation that's almost forgotten today, when we're being handed millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "work".
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say, really?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a commercial.
Brancusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he's gone.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards named after him.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when she takes her calf outside, she hears these instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brancusi".
The country is teeming with his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is enormous.
Even the communists have not been able to erase it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are now all over the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else would there be to say, to write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that attempt to reconstruct his fate, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you're not lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family that's as wealthy as you are, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however odious they may be.
Forget the stupid success stories that are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at this man's face.
Do you want to know how he managed to live, how, today, of him heard an entire mapamond?
It's simple, you know?
He worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși led a modest life, but one that would pick up the cues that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutsia, in Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have lived happily in patriarchal society.
Everything was moving quietly from one season to the next.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
Brâncuși's childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Grancuşi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancuși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, while making the pitcher, watching the people taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, Brancusi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palm with tar and drinks on the breathless.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people don't notice until after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then goes into hysteria, thinking her son is dead.
Towards evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by the lute players, he sees in the distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their souls at their mouths.
The party immediately turns to mourning.
Dad's already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone finds it appropriate to call her Baba Brandy, the brandyman's nurse and servant.
The cheese checks the baby's breathing, then puts horse manure gathered around under his nose.
The baby sneezes hard.
The people are applauding.
While the boy is left to sleep on his drunken, joyful, party of revelry continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brancuși asks Constantine to gather some sticks and bring them to him.
The father sits his child head down and, with the nuts the boy brings, beats him to remember.
And as he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around him can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the one he knew, makes him wonder, as he would admit in his old age, if the star itself is not participating in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At the present time, the city is not functioning
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that's it.
I haven't seen anything from the 2012 USL projects that goes forward.
No highway, no regional emergency hospital, you just see politicians fighting over possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside for a little while, get together and talk.
At the present time, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with the civil war, you don't have time for the people who elected you", said the Blue.
He said that the current political class had disappointed the electorate in Iasi, and that the result would be a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, which would represent practically the loyal voters of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will still be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing their reservations towards new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break with the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is being further fragmented, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD", said Blajuț.
He stated that he was not interested in running in the upcoming local elections, refuting rumors about his intention to enter the race for Mayor.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still considering whether to continue as an MP in the future term.
I tried to appeal to unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my image.
I don't want to, but we can't keep doing this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they are stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything", said Blăjuţ, who said the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected officials.
A colleague from Tatarstan said that he did not have enough money and had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's no shortage of money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the cash at the cashier.
At the end of my term, I'll make a report of all my expenses, except for the salaries of the staff and the maintenance of the office.
I happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the discounts for transportation, accommodation and the rest.
"To tell a parliamentarian that his money is not enough is pure hypocrisy", concluded Blăjuț.
