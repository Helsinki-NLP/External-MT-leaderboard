Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid they will look like fools
Some members of the National Assembly were intimidated by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Assembly members from various political parties fear that this could bring ridicule.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that the abbreviation "p" rhymed with the words twp and pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means poop.
A Welsh MP said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The Conservative MP said his party was approaching a name change to liberal, but noted that the abbreviation MWP is not far from the word muppet (puppet, fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u.
The Assembly's committee is currently working on a bill to change the names, which stated: Of course, the final decision on the possible appointment of the Assembly's members will be the responsibility of the Members themselves.
The Governance of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly for Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on the proposals, which showed that the change of the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
As regards the designation of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the title 'Members of the Welsh Parliament' (WMP), but the MWP option gained the most support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are obviously trying to propose alternatives, but the problem may be to reach agreement, especially for the Speaker, Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform laws will also include further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the exclusion of Members and the draft system of committees.
The Assembly members will have the final say on the question of their appointment when discussing the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour expresses a claim to Greek territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Djorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price a country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church have gone silent because of the problems in Harlem's churches
"The old people I talked to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Adams.
Today there is neither.
In his opinion, the decline in bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently now", he says.
 The bar is no longer a living room where people from the neighborhood meet regularly.
As for the churches, there is a fear that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later they will be back to square one.
He further stated that churches could be supplanted by rental housing, with residential neighborhoods filled by people who would not support the remaining temples in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he says. "So the day is coming when these churches will be completely closed, because it's unlikely that most people coming to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930's.
A black congregation that held worship services nearby claimed the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was a central figure in the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (Harlem's most important shopping street) who refused to hire and support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners had the bell tower replaced as part of the church's renovation plans.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called this bell the "Bells of the Poor".
The specialist who played it outdoors in July called it something else: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert is Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, who also noted that this was the first trumpet in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who started playing the larger trumpet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says there's no replacement at St. Martin's.
Over the past few months, St. Martin's has been the site of a complex history of architects and contractors, some brought in by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish administration, which is made up of secular leaders and manages the farm, wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese was "failing to pay the costs" of the parish administration, despite the fact that the parish administration had not shared the architects and contractors hired by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency regarding the conduct of the diocese.
13-year-old boy who was fishing for lobsters in California was injured by a shark
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack happened shortly before 7:00 A.M. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel of KSWB-TV in San Diego said he and his friends were diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when they heard a boy screaming for help, and he and his group then swam to the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but then he noticed the boy shouting, "Something bit me!"
Something bit me!
He had a completely torn collarbone, Hammel said, which was the first thing he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I told everyone to get out of the water", Hammel added. "There's a shark in the water".
The boy was airlifted to Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it turned out not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that over 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create a cosmetics mall-style alleyway to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with specialized assistants.
The investment is a significant £2.8 billion investment in the UK cosmetics market, which is growing steadily while sales in fashion and home goods are declining.The investment will test larger cosmetics aisles in 11 stores across the country.If successful, additional stores will be added in the following year.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves that once belonged to televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw available for the first time.
The current product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with branded spaces available, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup line to make most of its products available to vegans, who are increasingly demanding it from younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small quantities of food daily from local stores with a variety of goods means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble department stores, and his supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos stores into hundreds of stores and has also integrated several Habitat stores, both of which it bought two years ago, which according to its representatives increased food sales, making acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to innovate the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments had failed.
Sainsbury's tested joint venture with Boots after 2000, but the merger ended a dispute over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio three years ago, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for a turnover of £125m.
The company stated that the Lloyds chain will play an important role as it will add a wider range of premium skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have changed the look and style of the cosmetics aisles to give our customers a more comfortable shopping environment.
We've also invested in special training for colleagues who will be on call and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements.  Impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a major destination in cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping.
Peter Jones was furious that Holly Willoughby had cancelled her £11 million contract.
The star of Dragons' Day, Peter Jones, is furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Trula brand of interior accessories and accessories.
The pair's business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The host of This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Day star Peter Jones by pulling out of a lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture at the last minute to focus on her own mega-deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the golden girl of television, during a nervous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant he would no longer have time to devote to their Trula brand of interior accessories and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain and headed to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "The Truly project was clearly Holly's number one priority.
It was to be her long-term future, ensuring it for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was absolutely shocking to everyone involved.
Tuesday, nobody understood what was going on.
There's a warehouse at the Marlow headquarters full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, due to massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home accessories, as well as the possibility of further delay in launch.
Besides, it can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby proposed the Truly project with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became director in March.
The two couples are vacationing together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin, who is the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on business matters".
♪ Hard talk ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the media criticism that awaits him for his remarks, which some will consider "unfit president" and blame him for expressing such a positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous "moderator" voice.
I didn't sacrifice anything at all.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after an initial joint meeting in June in Singapore, and Trump hailed the first meeting as a major step on the path to denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Jong-ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's first steps on disarmament.
He noted that the US instead continues to apply sanctions in order to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to the assembly.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results  the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American troops home.
He also defended the unusual way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to speak as president, but then there wouldn't be 10,000 people standing outside trying to get in, instead there would be 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated one of the islands, killing hundreds
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's residents have been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not want international help, so it's a bit complicated", said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to participate in relief work.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia constantly faces, the country's readiness for nature's wrath is deplorable.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the active warning, may have contributed to the high number of casualties.
Even under favorable conditions, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to provide care for the earthquake victims is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure, spending heavily on roads and railways.
But the Widodo administration is plagued by a lack of funding, and next year it faces another election.
In addition, Widodo faces pressure from persistent religious tensions in Indonesia, as followers of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of the faith.
During the street fights between Christian and Muslim gangs, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced by the gangs using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool FC has drawn from a distance against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was sent off by Xherdan Shaqiri, about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal, his team having lost 1-0 at the time.
He threw the ball to the left and shot a farther away field.
His attempt sailed high above the penalty area and headed for the top right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the incoming Kepu Arrizabalaga into the net.
"I was just trying to get in the position, get the ball, players like Shaq always try to play as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I made one touch, I didn't think much about it and I fired.
Chelsea led at half-time 1-0 and were followed in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker, before this goal, returned the penalty to Mate Kovacic, turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic has shown a quick strike in the middle of the field.
Then he sent a beautiful penalty kick that led Hazard into penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and finished to the farthest pole when he shot left-handed to overtake Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool are set to face Napoli in the Champions League group stage, starting at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will be playing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 3pm in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude quake, which hit on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was filled with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened this morning after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has caught anything on the camera on board to contact us as they may have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene, who believe they know the woman, wanting to find out where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police said they are currently informing the victim's family members.
A cabbie who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but police told him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
Apartment owners are now being told they'll be back inside in a few hours.
One of the officers was heard telling another man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
He keeps saying, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, the next van was out.
There were several police officers in the cordon watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers unit anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference to protocol 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest landmark to be the subject of a dispute over the "re-writing of history"
Its removal would be a satisfaction for his fanatical Puritan followers like the Taliban having destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But Cromwell's company called Crick's proposal "discreet" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current discussion about the removal of statues, it was obvious that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Ham Thornycroft's magnificent rendering of Cromwell is a testament to his 19th-century perception and a part of the history of a figure who many still consider worthy of respect.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many to have been perhaps more than they are today, at the end of the 19th century, the protector of Parliament from outside forces, in his case of course the protector of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate account of the facts remains a matter of debate among historians.
But what is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure who embodies one side of that conflict.
The achievements he has made as Lord Protector also deserve celebration and respect.
A deadly pig has beaten a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by pigs at a market in southeastern China.
A man known only by the surname Jüan was found dead with a severed artery and bloodshot near a market in Liu-phan-shui prefecture in Quizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares a vaccine in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next barn open.
He said there was a large male pig in the belly with a bloody papilla.
According to the report, the forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram goose had stabbed the farmer to death.
"The cousin had bloody and crushed legs", said a cousin nicknamed Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to the security cameras, Jüan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Jüan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was separated from the others so it wouldn't attack anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Jüan's family and market representatives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig had pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife had managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
Shantia, they're curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
"They just need to be shown the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest United States in many places
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the pink will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa reached a Category 1 hurricane wind speed of 85 miles per hour at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, located 620 miles southwest of the Mexican outlet of Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm surge has begun over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
The pink will bring more than 25 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture, combined with the approaching stream, will then produce extensive and heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
In some places, rainfall of 2 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flooding, and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 millimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected.
Severe flooding can occur because conditions deteriorate rapidly, caused by the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Given the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unwise to go into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, while local storms bring gusty winds with dust in the air.
The approaching wet season in some parts of the coast of Southern California will cause heavy local rainfall.
More than 13 millimetres of precipitation may fall, which could cause a small amount of debris flooding and slippery track.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during its rainy season.
Late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, scattered showers of tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona, and the rain will be widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the four corners of the world and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, the United States may experience significant temperature fluctuations, with the Arctic cooling while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes results in sudden temperature changes at short distances.
A prime example of the sudden changes in temperature is the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, it will try again to re-establish and extend the lingering summer heat.
In many parts of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, with temperatures in excess of 70 degrees Fahrenheit [26°C] in several areas from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
In New York City, it could be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States throughout the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh audition was watched by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the powerful testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate persisted, until on Friday, radio and television stations cut their broadcasts for a last-minute twist: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal that would allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state, and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke with passion, said he was 100 percent sure that it hadn't happened.
The broadcast is likely to have been watched by more than 20.4 million viewers, Nielsen reported Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For the other networks that broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewership.
By comparison,  similar numbers of viewers watch a football playoff game or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-setting anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, averaged 5.69 million viewers during the daytime interview, according to Nielsen, the most of any network.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was high even after the hearing.
The main character of the Friday drama was Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, shouting at him by protesters as he tried to get to the Judiciary Committee hearing in the elevator.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes closed, listening to the lamentations broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one of the women.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
Someone said to him, "You have great power, but many women are weak".
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he'd say more at the committee hearing.
All the cable and other networks were on the air for hours after the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee next week, which is what the minority Democrats are urgently demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had a lot of power because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing political games on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused those who criticize her intention to leave the European Union of playing political games with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which appears alongside her interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her Brexit plan, which has been likened to a game of checkers, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other is 'totally absurd'.
Police have arrested suspect Dytone Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the alleged shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson arguing, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he confessed to shooting Sims.
According to information from the defense, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their diligence and efforts to enforce justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "healthy and shocked" by Sims' death.
"This is what you're always worried about", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached Mexico City's southern quarter.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid the volcano, after activity at the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has recorded several noises and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windows of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with law enforcement, and thousands more took part in parallel demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote that has divided society.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by law enforcement officers, throwing eggs and powdered paint, and the streets, which were once crowded with tourists, became dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, there were clashes, and the police used batons to bring the fighters under control.
For several hours, a group of independence supporters chanting "We forget, we do not forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local press reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
High tensions remain in the independence-seeking region a year after the referendum on 1 October declared Madrid illegal, but Catalan separatists celebrated it.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, but turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted the vote to a large extent.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the continuation of voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Independence groups camped outside Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but she had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would achieve independence.
We had one of our best moments last year.
My parents cried with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck, she says.
Although Catalan political parties seeking independence won a narrow (but important) victory in the regional elections last December, they are not able to continue successfully this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of the police by telephone, says that politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since the end of last year awaiting trial, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
'Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is showing us,' he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for car-crashing into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being hit repeatedly by a car in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 UK summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Besides, there could have been a drive-by shooting.
Meng's goal was a 1-0 victory for Livingston over Rangers.
Dolly Meng scored the first goal for Livingston to secure the win
Newcomer Livingston shocked Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard just his second 18-game defeat since taking over as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengu's shot proved decisive, helping Gary Holt's team to a second place finish at Hibernian.
Gerrard's team are still unbeaten in the Premiership this season and next Sunday they will face Hearts leader, who is eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extended their unbeaten streak in the league to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste the bitterness of a loss.
Livingston against the angry guests burned the chances
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, but his directness was causing Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt passed the gate, and Alan Lithgow's finish was then only on the side as he slipped past Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The home side were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors from standard situations.
And that's how the deciding goal came down.
Against Rangers, a straight free kick was played and Livingston managed to break through, Declan Gallagher and Robinson after the combination found Mengu and he scored from the centre of the penalty area.
At the time, Rangers dominated the ball, but they couldn't overcome the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's feet and Lithgow ended another standard Livingston situation next door.
The players were constantly sent to centres and the defence kept pushing them back until the Livingston 16th, when they were twice asked for penalties after Halkett's intervention on substitute Glenn Middleton and the referee's alleged hand.
The Livingston analysis is phenomenal.
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a result for Livingston.
All the players, as one man, have been exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of play and the players in the team have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but much credit goes to Holt for how the team has taken off since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredible, running a perfectly organised defense, while Meng kept the whole game from Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Under Gerrard they played very well on several occasions, but they were far from that level.
They missed the final out only once by getting past home defense and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it's a warning finger up.
Erdogan received more than a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany had a hearty breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose over issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police said they prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters appeared near the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents (many of them Kurds) also came forward, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Contrary protests show a difference of opinion about this guest, with some German Turks calling him a hero, while others condemn him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 am UK time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived, but the cyclist succumbed to his injuries at the scene.
The accident came just months after another cyclist was killed by a driver who fled the scene of the accident on Childers Street, about a mile (1.6 km) from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and notify relatives.
The road is closed, buses are diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured during riots at a high-security men's prison, according to a prison report.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 am British time on Sunday at the British prison Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Tornado Special Forces were called to the scene to bring the riots under control, and eight prisoners were separated into one wing.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A prison spokesman said: "We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident at the British prison at Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in prisons and we want to make it clear that we are handing those responsible over to the police and they can stay behind bars longer.
More than 500 inmates are serving their sentences at Long Lartin, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, a report emerged that the prison warden had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by one of the inmates.
Last October, a counterinsurgency unit was called to the prison to put an end to serious riots, when prisoners attacked guards with billiard balls.
For Hurricane Rosa, severe flooding is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (drought-affected areas may benefit)
The tropical low pressure in Arizona is an unusual phenomenon, but it's likely to happen early next week, with the remaining energy from Rosa moving across the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for the area from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecast for late Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix had tropical storm or low pressure status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with up to 15 centimeters in some places in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the middle Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to be 25 to 50 millimeters, with exceptions of up to 100 millimeters.
In places where there is no threat of flooding, the rain from the Rose may be useful because the area suffers from drought.
While flooding is a major concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first make landfall over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour [137 km/ h], is located 400 miles [620 km] south of the Mexican outlet of Punta Eugenia and is heading north at 12 miles per hour [19 km/ h].
The storm has hit the cooler waters of the Pacific, and it's losing intensity.
So when it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday afternoon or evening, it is expected to reach tropical storm strength.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be high, which means a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 75 to 150 millimeters of precipitation is expected between Baja California and northwestern Sonora, and in some places it may be as high as 250 millimeters", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm across Mexico northward until it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, then headed upward across Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest threat posed by Rosa or its remnants is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States", says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening tidal flooding and debris flooding in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys aged 17 to 18 and a man aged 20 have been arrested on suspicion of the attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy who was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 PM UK time.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are asking anyone who recorded the incident on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had endured the meanness and wrath of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and abhorrent tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said before a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered the viciousness and wrath of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey-Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in connection with the allegation.
The president said Saturday that the American people had a chance to see Kavanaugh's uniqueness, character and courage.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most respected legal minds of our time and a lawyer with a proven record of public service", he told his West Virginia crowd.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks to the election, which is one of the most important in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running, he said.
That's why I'm doing my best to support the exceptional candidates.
Trump has said that the goal of the Democrats is to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote on the floor of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be on the agenda no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia claimed hundreds of lives, the death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed ashore as huge waves from the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [20 m] hit the coast in the early evening, destroying everything in their path, and many people came and died.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude quake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy on the beach, not running away and becoming victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, trams, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 500 miles per hour in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 camps in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and businesses, hidden and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the aftershocks continued in this coastal city.
Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency reported that the tsunami's intensity could have been increased by the city's location at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, which is located 300 kilometers along the coast north of Palu, because the area is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were completely paralyzed and no information was available from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy now, but it could be much worse", he declared.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, but officials said the waves arrived at a time when the warning had already been issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings of an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications with the city of Palu and surrounding areas, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the military has begun sending relief cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees continue to need food and other basic necessities urgently.
The city's airport has been reopened to aid flights only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala made it safely to Palu, where employees are hiding in the sailing shelters set up in the office yard, they passed through the devastated areas on the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups embarked on the difficult task of working on post-disaster reconstruction, some of them complained that international humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, finances, supplies, and workers from other countries can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Only when the government declares this a national disaster can we open the door to international aid.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu unfolded, the families and friends of the missing persisted in hoping that their loved ones would be the miracle in the dark history of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days in the rubble with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who remained trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"Because I've been paragliding for a long time, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Subandono described how, hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse swept the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the contestants in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee filling an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was about to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported.
While he was busy, another man ran out behind the back of a Brink's employee and stole bags of money intended for deposits.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many perpetrators were involved.
If you have any information regarding their identity, please contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Saturday, he tweeted: "Being officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to unveil his new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for emotional reasons, according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has stated in the past that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think the word ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ty", West said this year, when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
From the word Kanye, which means "one", comes the word "ye", reflecting the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's another one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also presents himself with and without a link and in both upper and lower case.
The Mexican president has solemnly promised not to use the military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has solemnly promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never, under any circumstances, use the military to defeat the Mexican people.
In this square, on October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters, killing as many as 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were gaining momentum throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are causing young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area, said AI investor and promoter Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The Commission notes that the US government has not yet adopted a formal strategy on AI.
On the contrary, China unveiled its plan last year: it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"As all other countries are far behind the US and we are trying to breakthrough in AI, doubling the AI budget would be a good start", said Lee.
Double funding could double the chances of us having another big success right here in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI-focused companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the top rated American player named Othello, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and CEO of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee responded to previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to help uncover future visionaries.
As Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic leaders will not be chosen by China, but by big corporations", Lee added.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring the best minds from universities to work on AI for them in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help support the US in the area of IUI.
"I think that holders of a PhD in AI should be automatically offered a green card", he said.
The Chinese State Committee issued its New Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation ( NSF) and other government organizations distributing money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage partners from industry and academia.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
In contrast, the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has gone dormant for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. The move would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments drafted an agreement in June including a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gyorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts whether turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: 'Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that it is a price worth paying for the admission of Macedonia, a country that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, into communities like the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and decide according to the result.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has declared that as of 1:00 p.m. there were no irregularities in the course of the referendum.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name to allow it to join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian town of Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that the resulting referendum would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday said that 30 to 43 percent of voters are preparing for the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those interviewed, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first major blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overtakes the whole Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defence on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, securing a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguer's elegant goal in the 65th minute seemed at first glance ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker took a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He slipped through three Brighton defenders and ran out into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He went around one defender and then went around several others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a pass to the left where the ball found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguer, who with his right hand overtook Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguera has some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We were talking about him playing for about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave City the opening lead in the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling towards a distant prey.
Cityzens' forward hit the net just before it slipped into the car.
City are set to face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German city of Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies ' chances .
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the extremely competitive Scherzer is hoping to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, even if it still might have consequences for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have at least kept their wild card option, but they still have to claim their first division title.
Even if we're not losing anything, at least we can still step on the field with the thought that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with the crowd and the opponent, that's probably the highest level we're going to get this year.
Of course I want to experience it.
The Nationals haven't announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but it looks like they're going to let Scherzer pitch in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would have been his 34th start, started the bullpen on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, when he normally waves a day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly pointed to the situation surrounding his nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterms.
November will be the stake of everything we've accomplished.
The most important election of our lives is five weeks away.
It's a huge, huge opportunity, and even though I'm not running myself, I'm actually running, so I'm going up and down the country and fighting for our great candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats.
They are determined to regain power by any means, vicious and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to prevail over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "discourage and hinder".
"You've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, evil and liars".
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, namely Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with a loud whistle from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
You leaked the document?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, me, wait. Her body language was really bad. The worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer liberal.
They Do Not Tolerate Those Who Express Their Opinion
When the Momentum activists voted for my reprimand, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are no longer welcome, all for expressing an opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the reproach prompted was criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, about issues like that, that Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders on.
The invitation to the Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday said that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take that tone, and the promise of a more polite, gentler policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever did.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each view is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took the helm, because colleagues who I had previously thought shared a similar political stance were suddenly expecting me to turn 180 degrees and accept views I would never have otherwise agreed with  whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, and it doesn't really matter what I say, there's a barrage of social media criticism calling for recall, quitting politics on Wednesday, and I hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be purely political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the barrage of sexist or racist attacks every day and never hide from it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is the extent to which the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the liberal faction, and with every suggestion of "no confidence" or change in the electoral rules, the party is shrinking.
Over the last two years, a lot of people have been telling me not to stand out too much, to be quiet and to keep up, and then I'll be fine.
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which allowed my high school class to literally collapse, I have tried to push for better public services for those who needed it most - whether in local council or in the ministry.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would just say that as the country slides towards a Brexit that hurts households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on resolving my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not from the Momentum initiative in Nottingham, it's to the people of my constituency, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to have been able to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of impeachment or political accountability will deter me from trying to push forward what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr reaches the top
Two late attempts may have slightly shaken the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly exciting match on Tennent's Premiership day.
They now find themselves at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the win brought home a great defense and a better use of the chances, and Coach Peter Murchie has every right to rejoice.
"During the matches we have been tested a lot and we are unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Hats off to Ayr, they've taken a better chance than we have".
Thanks to a 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr took the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to overtake and Jason Baggot to record an unchanged try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and then, just after half-time, scored a solo try, allowing Ayr to go into the break with a 17-5 record.
But the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then followed a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was suspended, and as soon as the game started to resume, Ayr moved further into the lead with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned the Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and the Melrose used it as Bruce Colvin's unchanged attempt at the end of the meeting under heavy pressure.
However, the home side came alive again and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for striking Clim without a ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from a penalty shoot-out with the approaching Ayr horde behind him.
Climo changed, as he did almost at the start of the action, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing away on the fifth home run.
The star of the hit series Still Game is embarking on a new career in the food industry.
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is apparently starting a career in the service industry, and according to our information, he's been appointed CEO of a company licensed to operate a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be their last, and it seems Kiernan is already planning a life outside of Glasgow suburb Craiglang (home of the series).
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
The Sea is Ours: Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to regain access to the Pacific
The sailors surround the naval headquarters in La Paz dressed in sails.
They're waving blue flags at public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are under the motto: "The sea is our right".
It's our duty to get him back.
Throughout Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive  as is the desire to restrain the waters of the Pacific again.
Now, perhaps the most hopeful in decades, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1, after five years of trial.
"Bolivia is on the rise, it has a spirit of unity and balance and of course it believes in a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court's decision on large screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia so that, after decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate for sovereign access to the Bolivian sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who will be contesting a controversial re-election bid next year, also has a say in Monday's decision.
"Our return to the Pacific is within reach", he declared in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia  and even if it did, not much would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there's no question about the Bolivian arguments, it's possible that in recent years it has taken a step back.
"The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has undermined all remaining civility in Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The countries have not had each other's embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually swift.
"Monday will be a unique opportunity for Bolivia to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of discord and achieve mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - would use the naval issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
 A decision is an opportunity to realize that we must move beyond the past.
North Korea refuses to denuclearize until the United States can be trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not get rid of its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it's an illusion to think that continuing US sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows are showing the latest trends in the impressive headgear that you'll soon find in your store
If you want to expand your hat collection or to protect yourself from the sun perfectly, look no further.
In their spring/summer 19 collection, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of unusual oversized headgear on the pier that stunned audiences at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the show dock.
A unique piece of Valentino's was a bulky beige hat decorated with a paper roof that covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized supplements included a gem-lined melon, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple - but these are not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also showed off a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembled diving gear, including a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a corn dog with melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats will be available in the mainstream stores in your area.
The oversized hats are inspired by La Bomba, a straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide top that was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that lurked around every corner of social media has sent another big creation to the pier  a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in her swimsuit.
The bright orange Rafi bag, framed with rafi straps and completed with a white leather ear, was the unique piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 19 collection from Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the mainstream next summer. " With the designer's enormous influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Without language skills, global citizenship is not possible.
Scotland's independent schools are maintaining excellent academic results and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of exceptional test results, further reinforcing individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other social activities.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, their dream careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement tailored school curricula, we still see modern languages as a popular and sought-after choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you are speaking to his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
And we see from this year's test scores that languages are at the top of the table with the highest average grades among independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored the highest A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A grades in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a basic skill which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in both independent and non-selective schools.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that 17% of the reasons cited by employers as problems with filling jobs were insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities arise that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career path a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with this lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent could not speak any foreign language sufficiently to be able to converse fluently, with French being the only language where the number of people reached double-digit percentages (15 percent).
That's why it's important for children today to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the languages taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always offer a choice of languages and will teach him or her by experts in the field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, it is undeniable that in a global business environment, languages remain fundamental to a country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be called international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is set to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers are about to get their hopes up.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be entering Sunday's opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes he will play is not yet decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James made his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games public.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need to start pre-matches", he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's planned meetings for next week, including stops in friendly locations, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After the vote for his nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat was held, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterms, as Republicans risk losing control of the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia today, and where can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is taking place at 7:00 PM Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online below, via a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to speak about the ongoing hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained over sexual harassment allegations, with the Senate's expected confirmation vote delayed by a week while FBI investigations continue.
But the primary purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who are facing a tough election in November, regain their power.
So according to Reuters, these five meetings next week are all about "boosting volunteers and supporters" as Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House.
"Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that as the president enters the busy election season, he will travel to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Today's rally, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the last month, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican nominee for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, whose preferences are falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and raise his polling preferences", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage in the fight and hopes for success in entering the Sunday singles
After three one-sided series, the foursome on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum of propulsion is a fanciful sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this kind.
So, which side do they think the driving force is on now?
"They're six points ahead, now it's only four, so we could say we now have a moderate momentum we", said Jordan Spieth, as he prepared for his competition day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead and another 12 in the game.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel a gentle breeze in their sails and have plenty of reason to hope, thanks in part to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been unbeatable from the opening hole to the last hole and leads the others by example.
As his lap progressed, the throat-thumping cheering cries were getting louder, with the key putt sinking and the fourth match being decided as he and Thomas were two-two down.
He celebrated his putt, which won them the match at 15, with a similar cry, which proves his belief that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
"You just have to roll up your sleeves and get into it, just think about your own game", Spieth said.
None of the players have anything else to do.
18 pits where you have to go all the way.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed favourites for the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming European couple has four out of four and can't afford to make a mistake.
Mollywood was the only pair to cross the bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This wheel and the way energy flows between the tumultuous crowd and the players confirm that these players will need to be beaten on Sunday, and there is hardly a more popular player to cement a potential European win at sunset over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best of both worlds, in different holes.
But talk of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he was playing in a pair with Alex Noreno.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes deepened the Spanish and Swedish pit, from which they could not dig again.
There's no one left to help you dig out of the pit on Sunday.
Fourball and foursome matches are fascinating at close quarters because of the interactions between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and also how strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a substantial lead on the final day, but these foursome rounds have also shown that the US team is not afraid to fight, which some, especially in the Americas, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10-6
Europe will enter the Ryder Cup final day with a substantial lead after winning Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The spirited duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over the troubled Tiger Woods to add four points to their Le Golf National tally so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in an attempt to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the morning four-ball matches and won the series 3-1.
In the foursomes, the Americans offered more resistance, won two matches, but could not overcome their deficit.
Jim Fury's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", they are only the second pair to score four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match, they perfectly consolidated their performance, beating the downed Woods and the American rookie, Bryson Dechambeau, by an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who was struggling with two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had missed the morning fourball matches, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome and together beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it easy on that pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Triple-A winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a scoreless 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball matches and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to come back from a four-point deficit to enter individual matches, although Furyk's side as defending champions need only a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of second place, however, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will likely be beyond their power.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions had deepened mistrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "substantial countermeasures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding reaction from the US", he added.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there can be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is out of the question that we should be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his position was crucial in that he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has sought to achieve a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on nuclear disarmament first and raises tensions through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion and even by opposing the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end".
Yet Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missile strikes on US soil were inevitable after President Trump called Kim a "suicide bomber".
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, sang at the UN praising Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea was "denuclearized".
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying it didn't matter if it took two, three years or five months.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue strictly and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with a statement that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action".
According to his statement, Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he expected were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
The goal of this year's new course at Harvard University is to get all students more sleep in an effort to counter the growing trend of studying all night with the help of caffeine.
Researchers have found that students at the world's leading university are often helpless when it comes to the very basics of taking care of their health.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Clinic, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course by a lecture he gave on sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
At the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why do I have to know about this until now, in my senior year?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said that the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the workweek.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of a boarding room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of a regular sleep routine.
In the next section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know  just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
There's still a culture where students are proud to be able to study all night, he says, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Providing adequate, quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even against weight gain, because sleep deficit puts the brain in a starvation mode, so they feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, was helping Professor Czeisler design a course after attending one of his seminars last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to try to push the course to the university level.
He hopes that in the next step, it will be possible to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of study before embarking on a demanding study.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock for both bedtime and wake-up time, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1: 0 Rangers Meng 's goal has sunk Gerrard 's men
Rangers suffered another round of grief on the road as Dolly Mengu's shot sentenced Steven Gerrard's dismal team to a 1-0 loss at Livingstone.
The Ibrox hosts were looking to record their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard just his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side 8 points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were nowhere near a draw.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston have climbed to third, trailing Hibernian by just one goal.
And the Rangers may have more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence suffered a head injury after being struck by an object apparently thrown from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and then Rangers overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11th man Livi who took the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled with how his well-constructed squad smothered his opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated in possession, but Livingston was more active when he got the ball.
They were only supposed to score in the second minute of the match when the first call-up of Mengo sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keagan Jacobs' long straight then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, only managed to miss the back bat by a wide margin.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, it seemed they had more hope than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to a penalty kick after a quarter of the game when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed just two shots on target in the first half, but ex-Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely out of balance by Lassan Coulibaly's head and a soft shot from Ovie Eyar.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute could have been a game-changer, no one can argue that they deserved it for their effort alone.
The Rangers have once again failed to match Jacobs' horn.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Mengu for an easy finish.
Gerrard took over at halftime, switching Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the switch took effect almost immediately when the winger found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett shooting one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then also held Lithgow's wide-headed corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed a penalty for getting involved with Jacobs, but Thomson missed it again.
Chronicle: The inventor of the Geiger computer
And now here's a page from our Sunday morning newsletter: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the construction of a device known as the Geiger computer.
The Geiger computer, in addition to being an integral part of science today, became a pop culture icon when it was featured in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by science-loving cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What the hell is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger computer, it detects radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on headphones, you actually hear the sounds of atoms that radioactivity creates in minerals.
Seriously, I can hear them crack!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They then see a protein that's common in many types of cancer and inject it back into the body.
The vaccine under test is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells was cured of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
In this method, the immune cells are extracted from the patient, modified in the laboratory to detect a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 supports the growth of several types of cancer including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of harvesting immune cells from patients and teaching them to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West with a MAGA cap on his head became the target of criticism for his support of Trump after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he sang the praises of US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song, Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap that read Make America Great, he launched an attack on the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
I've talked to some white guy so many times, and he said, "How can you recognize Trump when he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The Saturday Night Live (SNL) show opened with a scene with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech was not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by sharing his story.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes for his hat.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me not to go in there with that hat on.
They're usually bullying me!
And then they told me I was at the bottom, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see how I'm down? I'm gonna put on my Superman coat, because that means no one's gonna tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments earned the audience a roar at least twice, and the other SNL performers were embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the media: "The whole study was in a state of grave silence".
West was invited to replace the late singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he performed "I Love It" dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West was endorsed by TPUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "A message to one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST DAV".
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just being himself, and that's absolutely amazing.
But I am determined NOT to change anyone (by buying their music, their clothing brand or by promoting their art) who I believe is adopting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are, too, she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "Ye", formally known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was also named Snoop Lion, and then there's of course the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has condemned toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of the boy hero, saying that for such characters on screen, young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he says he thinks something has gone wrong and is thinking about how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt it was very important to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel it's very important to address where we've got something wrong with masculinity", he said.
What do we teach men during adolescence when the problem we see now arises?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity for its exaggeratedly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What does television teach and what is happening on the streets that young boys feel they have to have this particular side of manhood?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that when the show ends next summer, he will not be filming any more prologues or Game of Thrones sequels, because he is already done with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard's play True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever heard from Game of Thrones.
"Thanks to this show, I met my wife, so in a way she gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose Ygritte played the love of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslene family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
More than 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to near zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people year on year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70  90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission result from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her employee leaked GOP senators' data, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had sent the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to the legislator's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations come from far-right pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that IP addresses that identify the source of the leaks are linked to Waters' office and have provided information on a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Her denial is full of anger", wrote Fleischer.
It means she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He must not behave defiantly.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer was apparently comparing Waters's reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh from Democrats, who accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's great", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English reviews again in the understated spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is common nowadays to look for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film, and so is this re-incarnation of the action comedy parody Johnny English  which was first introduced in the 2003 film Johnny English and brought back to life in 2011 in the film Johnny English Returns.
Is it going to be an ironic self-satire about how we're obviously incapable of a new national export item?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his distinctive facial expression has got the opportunity to screw it up again  with his name signaling better than anything else that he is a generous comic creation intended especially for non-English audiences.
He's, of course, the clumsy secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to subtle charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a spoonful of the guy who contributed the one-note tune to the opening melody of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character was originally based on an international traveller and mysterious man, whom Atkinson once played in now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, leaving behind a mess of chaos.
There are a few pleasant moments to be found in this latest adventure of Johnny English.
I liked how Johnny English came to the helicopter in his medieval armor and the helicopter hit him slightly on his helmet.
It shows Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humor sounds a little understated and oddly superficial, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as one of their components.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's quirky adventures are not as inventive and punchy as Atkinson's wordless gags in the introduction of Mr. Bean.
The actual background of the film's story is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spies and, to the consternation of acting agent Kevin Eldon, who has unfortunately missed only a small role, has revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and combative figure who is already on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a quasi-Theresa May character, but she doesn't have much to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that if every active spy has been exposed, she will have to call someone to retirement.
So, Johnny English himself comes on the scene, now employed as a director in a fancy institution, giving private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here are some fun gags, like English giving a School of Rock-style espionage lesson.
So England is called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets his longtime former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to an affected submarine commander, for whom Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a pity.
So Batman and Robin, the master of disaster in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in the field and encounter the gorgeous femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, as played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd feuds: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glitzy French restaurant; they cause chaos when they sneak onto the Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volt's house.
All the tricks are pulled out of the sleeve at the last minute, but as impressive and as tempestuous as they are, it all works a little bit like a children's TV show.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And as with all the other films with Johnny English, I still have to think why the British film industry doesn't finally give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies working on Britain's four-day workweek plan paid as a five-day
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan whereby the British should have a four-day work week but be paid in five days.
The party allegedly wants the management of companies to redistribute the savings made by the AI revolution by giving workers an extra day off.
That would mean employees would have a three-day weekend, but would take home the same pay.
Sources claim that the idea would be in line with the party's economic plan to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: 'We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour would not be the first to support the idea, with the Green Party including a four-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
The Labour Party as a whole, however, has so far failed to push the effort.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy, nor is it being considered".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has expressed his determination to reclaim power from the "anonymous CEOs" and "wealthy men" of the service sector.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies would not get back their entire stake, as the Labour government could apply deductions for the found guilty.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of private sector assets to employees, who could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes, discussing whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"But of course", said Kennedy.
As I said, when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges were brought, I asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.
But it seems Graham's voice is firmly established.
"I've made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there should be some bulletproof charges", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied anything", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one he names can confirm that.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don't see how anything could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it succeed in contributing to poverty reduction?
Saturday in New York City is the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive lineup of stars with an even more impressive mission: to end world hunger.
In its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If viewers want to get a free ticket to the event (unless they're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they have to complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or doing something meaningful to raise awareness of the event's goal of ending poverty.
With 12 years to go, how far is Global Citizen really going to go in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" where people feel they're actually making a difference when they sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million shares from its supporters since 2011, moving towards various goals.
The organization says that these events helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group reported that its shares had generated 390 commitments and declarations, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and developers who have committed to "helping children reach their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after over 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, which will provide nutrition allowances to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we'll fall and fail".
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the celebrities who will perform at this year's event in New York, along with hosts Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to limit Russian energy exports, says the interior secretary.
"If necessary, Washington may call in its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East", US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke is said to have stated that Russian involvement in Syria  where they are acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the main reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy there, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe", he is reported to have said.
He says there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event sponsored by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is positioning itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option against Iran and Russia is more fuel reduction and substitution", he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has embarked on a mission to promote liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, making Berlin, according to Trump, a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's vehement opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am convinced that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of coercion and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position drew opposition from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third country interfering with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holyoke, Massachusetts city hall, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in the top job", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm going to seriously consider running for president.
Warren told President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting that he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center, fifty percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 against.
Other notable names among Democrats being discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaking at the Donald Trump rally on PTSD
Track Palin, 26, was drafted on September 11, 2007, and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"In what my own son has been through since he returned, I can relate to other families who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They're coming home a little different, tougher, coming back with the question of whether people have respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have given to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed amicus curiae in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers' objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and his sons, members of a violent gang, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Representatives of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a high number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as nations that face serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle", states the amicus curiae brief.
The representatives further argued in the filing that a policy that denies immigrants entry is detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
Asylum should never have been designed to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu is doubling and desperate efforts are underway to rescue the survivors
For those rescued, the situation continued to deteriorate.
"It's very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to balance her restless son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is precious.
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, searching through their flooded belongings, and rescuing whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake burst into seams.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside for severe aftershocks.
Tears flowed from his eyes as he recalled the devastating earthquake that shook his fifth-floor hotel room, where he lived with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save.
"I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her, or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying through propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador accused China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid ad in the Des Moines Register of the China Daily, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, but China denies the accusations.
According to US officials telling Reuters, Trump's accusations of Beijing trying to interfere in US elections are a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war, with both sides adjusting tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade conflict should have hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his Sunday Des Moines Register, "China has now doubled its bullying by publishing its propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, China is exploiting America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a newsstand on the streets here in Beijing, you will find only limited dissent and you will not see any real picture of the diverse opinions that Chinese citizens may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, as the media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He added that some of China's most prominent newspapers had rejected his offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn that for the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans are a better chance at women's suffrage.
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that it will take its toll on them in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and a majority of Republicans have already expressed a desire to go to the vote.
"These things can't go back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article for The Hill published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute request for an FBI investigation from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, they will not forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierr, a consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate halls as Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will cross all boundaries", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news portal.
People say that motivation is already high; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided suburban female voters and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who may not like the president but don't vote often.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be a backlash if Republicans confirmed their support for him.
"It's been a big mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, it's how the Republicans feel about it and how they react to it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided over who to believe at the dawn of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with favor leaning more toward Ford.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents said they believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitals to her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, called Inrupt, is a company that's based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is retained and who is allowed access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Project Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to get started now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and work tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, and they're all available on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal online data store is that only the user decides who has access to each type of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's intention, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring the resources, process and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could start building their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they will implement a complete change that will completely overturn all their business models overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I see the next era of the web with great optimism", Berners-Lee added.
Father Bernard Vann: celebrations of the Victoria Cross bearer during World War I
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a combat veteran during World War I was celebrated on the 100th anniversary in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing of Britain's highest military honor.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was incredibly symbolic that the tablet was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic battle.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through very dense fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he rushed across the line of fire and led the soldiers forward with "the utmost courage", disabling three of the field guns himself.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions are something I will never come close to in my life, but it makes me feel a deep sense of humility.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid the wreath at the conclusion of a procession led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be able to take part in the parade and added that the courage of a true hero demonstrates the support that many people will express for him.
MMA fans waited late into the night for the Bellator 206 finale and instead got the Peppa Pig series .
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling finale of Bellator 206 and then you miss the main event.
The San Jose schedule featured 13 matches, including six majors, and was broadcast live in the UK by Channel 5 all night.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, UK viewers were left in shock when Peppa Pig appeared on screen instead of broadcast.
Some were really disappointed, waiting until morning specifically for this fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's fairy tale as "some sick joke".
"It's a government order that as of 6:00 a.m. this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
Yes, it was Piglet Peppa.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work to ensure that their broadcasts could be seen by viewers in the UK in the future.
"When I think about the re-run, I think we can sort it out", Coker said.
But it's Sunday at six in the morning, their time, and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday of our time, which is Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it came out, we exchanged a lot of messages, and it wasn't exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you that won't happen again.
We're going to cut it down to five games instead of six as we normally do. We tried to give the fans a little bit more and we stretched it out.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that as a teenager, he felt inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that it wasn't until high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview on Radio 4's first show Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a parent, he started to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
As a stuntman on the first Laverne Daley program, he said that as a teenager he felt "less than everyone else" because it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.
In his own words: "To this day, I have truly felt inferior and different, and this has given me the strength and motivation to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, so he said he wouldn't disappoint anyone after they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading LGBT rights activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give that hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - he was surprised.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but says the age difference was never a problem for them.
When you're young, you're going through so much. He went to his first Olympics at 14 and three years later his father died of cancer. It's hard to find a peer who's experienced the same successes and misfortunes.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole outlook on the world had changed.
"If you'd asked me a year ago, I'd have just talked about how I need to win a gold medal", he said.
And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the idea of death, and one of the last things he asked him was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you're not going to be here anymore so you can sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he really stopped breathing and was dead that I finally could admit that he wasn't immortal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is exactly what I've been dreaming of all my life", he said. "Jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling".
The story also inspired his choice of the song "Flow" by Heather Small, which made an impression on him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in poor form , sidelined for Saturday 's Ryder Cup games .
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to show better form to make it a less than unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and foursome.
Instead of being the center of attention, as he had been many times before for the U.S., the five-time winner spent the day alternating encouraging and improving his game in the hope of making up for his reputation.
The 48-year-old has not been the most direct even at the peak of his career, which is not ideal for the tight Le Golf National, where mistakes are usually retaliated for in long course.
And as if the field itself wasn't a challenge enough, Mickelson faces British Open defending champion Francesc Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has managed to win all matches this week in a pair with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 individual games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, grabbed me by the shoulder and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
She has high self-esteem.
He's a Hall of Famer and in the past and this week, he's made a significant contribution to our team.
I guess I just couldn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized and we felt that this is exactly how we had to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached the heights of his individual balance.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought certain invaluable values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great companion", he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him, and it was great to watch.
His contribution is not just in his game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a strong lead may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from his own experience that a strong lead in the individual entry on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but nevertheless made it across the finish line with the closest possible victory of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"I have to constantly remind myself how we had a strong lead in Valderrama; we had a strong lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama we won, but just like that", said Bjorn, in the photo, after the 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and led Le Golf National 10-6 yesterday.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that the game is not over.
We're going full throttle tomorrow.
We'll stand on the lawn and do everything right.
Until the points are on the board, the game is not over.
We have our goal, and that's to win this trophy, and that's what we have to focus on.
As I've said from the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but I'm also well aware that we're facing the other side  against the best players in the world.
Excited by the success of his players on the challenging golf course, Bjorn added: "I could never have anticipated the events.
We have another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow is an individual performance, and that's something completely different.
It's great to be on the court with a partner when you're doing well, but when you're out there by yourself, it puts all your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message that players must remember, to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will want his players to play better as individuals than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the big tournament on the final day, when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe achieved the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 encouraged his players to the last day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to start fast, like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this momentum is unleashed in one direction, those mid-game matches are of particular importance.
We made our lineup and placed the boys in a way that we felt like we were going to try to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and faces Rory McIlroy in the top fight, with the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the top half of the standings.
"I went with this group of boys in this order, because I thought that's how we'd go all the way", Bjorn said of his individual selections.
Germany 's new warship was again put on hold
Local media report that the latest German Navy frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 as a replacement for aging Cold War-era warships, but that will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and cost accumulation.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg class frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from troubling problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to include high-performance artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Other important features include a longer maintenance periodicity − it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
But continuing delays mean that the most advanced warships that have enabled Germany to show off its power overseas will become obsolete by the time they enter service, reports the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned several major software and hardware flaws that made the warship unusable for deployment on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors - only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship had significant overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7 000-tonne vessel Rhineland-Palatinate is considered twice as heavy as similar classes of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project − including crew training − becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in view of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy actually "has no ships capable of deploying".
The government official said that this issue has been compounded over time as the old vessels have been decommissioned but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust uncovers the secret life of bats
A new study on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how bats use the land to hunt for food.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the whistling and sand-batter bats, as well as the light and water-batter refugees at Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The organisation's staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and the activity of each species.
They then map their natural environment and report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important to bats and how they are used by different species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management work, such as grassland creation, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Great Britain have declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which has an impact on grassland and environmental loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as airplanes and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats, can also pose dangers.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to pinpoint insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes the leopard very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of assemblies, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established the first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great bat room", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about the infant, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It stresses the importance of bat control before any maintenance is carried out on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one mother cluster could kill up to 400 females and young, likely to wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, abuse, disturb, or destroy their meeting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our young, and we just don't know how their populations are feeding off many of our species".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations "fake news" and says people want to "publicize" themselves using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in a live Instagram interview, calling the allegations "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
"What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to make themselves known by my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for moral damages in the amount appropriate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was 99% a good guy who failed one percent.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reconsider the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK would forever regret the loss of carmakers
The UK "would forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has stated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its small plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what car manufacturers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a just in time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom cars.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border disruptions, which could lead to delays and parts shortages in the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily value of stocks at its Derbyshire plant, the company stated, and production would thus cease.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was 'precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks'.
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows us not just to talk about the current success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains".
Toyota could not say for how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnstone for 24 years and is a member of the factory's union, said that its members are increasingly concerned: In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed" to next week as Brett Kavanaugh's fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and potential interference by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has been a matter of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of tapping into conversations with Trump and impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
He went to the White House last Monday, and new information emerged that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was called with Trump, who was at the UN in New York at the time.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which also included Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It wasn't set, it could be this week, I understand the delay to another week given all the other stuff that's going on with the Supreme Court".
We'll see, and I always like to inform the press.
Some reporters have denied this claim: Sanders hasn't held a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of brief press conferences was not due to a resentment of television reporters wanting to dazzle, although she said: "I don't agree with the fact that they want to dazzle".
Then she suggested that we increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president is holding more meetings based on the concept of questions and answers than any other president before him, she added without citing evidence: We'll look at the numbers.
Short press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's incomparably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often, and you've seen us really often over the last few weeks, there's going to be a brief press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by appearing freely and, on several occasions, bizarrely before a gathering of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wishes that they remain after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimbursement of the costs of applying for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, leading to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very distressing time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery for a head injury .
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Reed told reporters he was injured just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and there he somehow collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on stretchers and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details yet on the type/scale of the injury and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher roaming charges when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher roaming charges when they buy property in the UK, which will provide extra cash to help the homeless, according to the Conservatives' new plans.
This move neutralizes the success of Corbyn 's attempt to attract young voters
The tax increase on the spikes will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announced that foreign buyers will be charged higher roaming charges when they buy property in the UK, with the extra cash going towards helping the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income individuals.
The tax increase on spikes will be collected from individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, with additional funding to support the government in the fight against street sleeping.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current toll tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental properties after purchase, could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to £120 million a year in funding.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get into the housing system.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" for a large number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the toll to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of keeping property prices high by fighting for land but not using it, and urged May to drop quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's housing shame.
Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to 'no-fault' evictions.
He also wants to give the committees more authority to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term to renewing the British dream, that life should be better for every new generation.
That means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But we cannot allow it to be as easy for non-UK individuals and companies based abroad to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the indignity of sleeping on the street remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run Scotland".
Sunderland football boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-Eastern club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after progressing to the Scottish Premiership with St Mirren last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But as a child, I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden with my father, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I am successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims he feels no concern about such a big club following such recognised names, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"The club is a Premier League club because of its structure and equipment", he said.
"Getting there is no easy task, but I would probably consider myself successful if only I could get the club there".
Ross is only three years into his managerial role, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month rotation as coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and turned St Mirren from relegation fringe to championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", recalled Alloa when joining the team.
I really believed that management was more appropriate for me than acting.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing well, I had a reasonable standard of living, and I was enjoying some reasonable maximums.
But acting can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel good about management.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, which makes me feel like I'm in the right place, like I've never been in all my adult life.
The full interview with Sportsound can be heard on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has boosted sales in Britain's struggling pubs, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the pubs and bars sector recorded a turnover increase of 2,7%, but that the turnover of restaurants decreased by 4,8% in July.
Peter Martin, CGA business adviser who compiled the data, said: Continued sunny weather and longer than expected England's World Cup participation meant that July followed a similar trend to the previous month, June, when pub sales rose by 2.8%, with the exception of restaurants, which were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
The hostels with drinks and bars fared much better than the restaurants, which, when the same factors were taken into account, saw a decline.
Food bars also saw a decline, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go for drinks.
In the controlled pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6% in the month, while food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality sector analyst, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of domestic sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a year-on-year decline in turnover of 4,8% will be particularly painful given the continuing cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators with food offerings, and time will show whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relief.
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand introduction.
Sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research has revealed that one in five children, some under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram accounts
The news raised concerns that sexual content was being published
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, set up social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake accounts on Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they run a non-intrusive "main" account, which they show to their parents, while also having a private one.
One mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to rape her.
Research by the UK's Digital Awareness Organisation and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11-18 have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where their parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Voice of the Athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to draw on her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect among the Scottish, UK and world athletic communities and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from him bringing her on board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
An American who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has four Olympic gold medals combined and who is a regular commentator for the BBC has overcome a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It's exhausting work, but I've managed to recover completely, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging news!
An ad for a breast milk vacuum comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A company that makes breast milk vacuums has divided the online world with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to nursing mothers.
To mark the launch of the aforementioned 'sweetest wearable breast milk vacuum cleaner in the world', consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by a dark-skinned music video to showcase the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a dream-filled cow barn to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I suck milk, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't veins, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "I pump, I pump, I feed the babies, I pump, I pump, I suck my beauties".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it belittles the dairy industry's dangers.
Very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like we need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except we steal their babies within a few days of birth", one woman wrote.

Another user commented: "It's understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk vacuum cleaners for mothers who are keeping their babies?
Another added: "Advertising detached from reality".
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song seemed "gifted".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a vacuum cleaner if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow sucking milk.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I take it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product, written by a woman.
Another user commented: Funny ad aimed at moms who suck milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discreet breast milk suckers tucked into their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on understanding the essence that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's breast milk vacuum cleaner is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold babies, and even to suck and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarin, partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development programme commented: The Elvie breast milk soother is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be launched boldly and provocatively.
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and nurses, we wanted to put the focus on breast milk sucking and all its challenges, while demonstrating in a fun and telling way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new sucker brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared at a showcase for designer Marta Jakubowska, using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have moved peacefully to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and procedures put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult for supporters to place children.
Traditionally, the majority of supporters have been illegal immigrants themselves, and they feared that they would jeopardise their own ability to stay in the country by claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Matthew Albence told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to support unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are in the country illegally and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we're continuing to track these individuals", Mr. Albence said.
Officials seeking to process cases involving children more quickly have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, not 60 days as per the previous standard, shelter workers say.
Many will present themselves via videoconference call rather than in person to present their case regarding legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are classified as not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violence or attempted escape, shelter workers said, and reports that have surfaced in the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where symptoms of child suffering are more overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or for parting with friends could cause the trauma that many struggle with.
Syria will tell the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "we will treat them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the crowd.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to fight in this holy battle until it had cleared all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and also Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were right for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that led refugees to stay away from home.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "is being removed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to 'revising the articles of the current constitution' and warning against interventions.
Why Trump Wins Second Term
With this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, although many liberal viewers probably hope that his presidency will end the impeachment and scandal early.
That would be the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
So far, there's no sign of any spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, average prime-time viewership on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and on MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News network averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has a peak ratings of up to 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights.
"This is a seductive thing that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, creator of the ABC drama "The President-Elect", about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran comedy writer and host of "Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a cab in Boston.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny", Scovell told me.
There's a funny value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury only privileged viewers can afford.
But it's beyond the reach of an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a six-hour panel discussion on "Deep Background" as the source of Bob Woodward's book "Fear", the bomb-bombing Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, and the consequences of tumultuous descriptions, um, of Mr. Trump's anatomy according to Storm Daniels.
I'm never gonna watch Super Maria the same way again.
"Part of what it does is like a reality show that feeds you every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the daily broadcast of the Trump show with a repeat of the show and daily storylines (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'd be behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss's this week, it was sunny outside on the north shore of Kauai, 26 degrees, but he was staying inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away from it, not with Brett Kavanaugh being brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from outside is pouring into the midterm elections.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a redistricting that has left two candidates fighting for a seat.
This newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district touched on campaign finance between the main party financial arms, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely watched March special election to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador instead of supporting China, then backed out.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a slight departure from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners moved Trump's management organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only taken into account against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any sanctions assessment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now engaged in a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance of the gathering that the administration is assigning to him, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any major new reports or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion to Mr. Bolton, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
Another unexpected event could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, of which there is now very substantial evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation to whether the Trump campaign was connected to Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress were to change sides, Mr. Trump would face accountability in this body just as he prepares to go before the voters again and perhaps the jury of his own members of the House.
That's a lot of conditions, unless I'm implying that Trump's fall is inevitable -- or his equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice about how we can affect the prolongation of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, but it would have to be resisted by the West and backed by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the year of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this report revealed that he proposed secret recordings of the president last year and speculated on his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is inaccurate.
How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, are we going to vote in the middle of a congressional term that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be put to a long winter's sleep.
I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the hooked cross.
With a history like this, I just have to be optimistic.
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is feeling optimistic ahead of the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G for the Europa League competition.
A knee injury prevented full-back Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game and we believed we could win something and we came away with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled it off in the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed more in the second half and were a better team.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us I'm sure we can push them and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough considering my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a factor in why we feel good.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it, we have a great training.
Let's hope that we can now push the past season into the background and be successful.
Women are not sleeping because of the fear associated with retirement savings
Although those surveyed had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members.
About half of the individuals in the national study said that they talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to talk", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial adviser: Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets - if you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles during a crisis.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the strength of the attorney for your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Keep in mind the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just about the money, but who the doctors are?" asked Martin.
What will the medication be?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by an air rifle as he left his home at night.
The victim, 40, was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are urgently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with more victims expected.
As a result of the communication disruption, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the Regent's office in Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the towns of Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast of the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically within the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia's northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami as high as 33 feet [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with the execution of a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Highway Patrol on Saturday.
According to the police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held on an uncovered bond of $500, KTUU TV reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared in his defense that he was "not guilty, absolutely", the TV station reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence crime report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are down, with a rise in deaths expected in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City .
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected of the New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment not imposed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
On October 31st, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan by crashing pedestrians and a cyclist on the trail.
According to the notice of commencement of the death penalty proceedings filed in the Southern District of New York, if prosecutors want to get the death penalty, they'll have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury.
Both of these charges are punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the intent to blackmail, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and cold-blooded thought", prosecutors said, and the manner in which Saipov carried it out was described as "horrible, cruel and perverse".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucca,' the report of the intention states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last passed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but in September 2009 was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of conscience in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the prosecution, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also requested an ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saip's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, during a protest at the Conservative conference today, solemnly promised to mobilize the People's Army.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "report" to an uncomfortable situation from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she take charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the UK would be "done" if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in easing her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by the Conservatives, who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid the attacks of Brexiters, Conservatives and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone has spoken at a Leave Means Leave meeting about wanting to remove the Prime Minister.
He suggested that Mr Farage be involved and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I'm in favour of Brexit, but we need to remove the Prime Minister".
He expressed his disagreement with the EU, saying: "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to create our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed the view that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Prime Minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for her, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually rioting in the streets and getting us to the first place.
Please leave the Prime Minister alone and start listening.
In a prepared message to May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises".
Farage told the assembly that politicians must feel anger if they betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not allow them to.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want our political class, which is on the verge of brexit, to feel our anger.'
"We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never give up until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, people marched through Birmingham for perseverance and then held a two-hour assembly in the city center.
A number of activists were holding banners for the Conservatives against Brexit, a group that was formed this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for security issues with the party app at the opening of the conference.
'These are the people who are telling us that they can have the information systems in place and all the technology for a shirtless border and for borderless free trade in Ireland,' he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to give her presidential bid a thorough consideration.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she will give a thorough consideration to running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 campaign co-chair in Massachusetts.
There was speculation that she might defeat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting at City Hall since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in the top job.
Arrest in the LSU shooting of Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytone Simpson at 11pm ET at a press conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who is caught on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University's college boarding school early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde went to help his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, carrying a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-3 junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's commands would play a significant role in the race.
From the best starting position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost put Hamilton in an awkward position when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and let Hamilton enter the traffic on the tail of the group, which was to be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop a lap later and followed Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close lead in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend himself a third time after the double.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap.
He then led much of the race, holding onto the track and focusing on the fast finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and achieving fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but failed to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me walk by.
"The team has done an extraordinary job, it has an extraordinary combination of two strong personalities", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what was happening in the Senate showed that the people were greedy, disgusting and dishonest.
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the leaks and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish it?
Remember her answer... you released the documentary "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no, I know.
I didn't publish it.
Okay, hold on a minute.
We published... no, we didn't publish, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the letter was released in early September − but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't publish her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill newspaper reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
However, her denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who said during a meeting on Saturday: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but she had the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of a Supreme Court nominee who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
You see the petty, the rude, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control", Mediaite reported on the president's statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars three against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee Hockey Team
The Dundee Stars made up for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a rematch on Saturday in Dundee with a score of 5-1.
The Giants have a two-point lead in time thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney, the home team tied, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for the team lead at Dundee, but then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men, who turned the score and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaul and four minutes later with an assist from David Rutherford as Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the hectic opening half, Sullivan returned the home team to the game in a time of 13:10, before Matt Marquardt secured Cownie's equalization in 15:16.
Dwyer took the Giants into the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard again equalized with a goal in the goalless draw in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure the lead for the first time in the match for the Dundee team in the second half, and he secured the victory in the semi-final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home in Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died to ensure the flight of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers before the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died securing the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to afflict the area, and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the wildly moving swinging tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in place to ensure that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for air navigation in Indonesia, said that this decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We were very saddened to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"The number is likely to continue to rise as many bodies were still under the rubble and many people were not able to reach us", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached 20 feet [6 m] devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Bodies are being brought in by ambulances every minute.
Clean water is precious.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
This is a tragedy, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earthquakes struck Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, one man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing after it previously said it had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it had found one man missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events was remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon before the start of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low.
"It was a huge stroke of luck", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to cross the deep water belt to the emergency exit in a submerged plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on improvements to the pier also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to haul people ashore before the plane sank into about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network databases indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any accident.
Analyst determines the time of night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday completed the indictment in a reopened trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He sketched for the jury how he used cell phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Chambers, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and confirmed he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Jessica Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He's erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense plans to present final statements on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed claim that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are experiencing a resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues couple for giving testimony after a racist text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrongly-sent text message from a mother who complained that she was another black woman.
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "swearing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed shock when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEEEE, NEXT BLACK" was a text message Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her mistake, the "shameful" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then she was sent home by Uber.
Mrs. Maurice is now suing the couple for severance pay and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for a period of six months for her lodging work with the employer for whom she was originally employed, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this kind of thing is not done", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple are opposed to claims that they are racist, defending themselves by saying that terminating Mrs. Maurice's employment was a sensible thing to do, because they feared that they could no longer trust her after having offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racists", said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
But go.
Comparing the lawsuit to the "deportation", Plasco said that his wife had a baby only two months old and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing", added the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the public quickly condemned the couple on social media, challenging their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's tremendous success.
She said that her father was optimistic about the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about the little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet" because of his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington's eventual success, which she describes as a very important member of our family.
"He was quite a quiet man and not a boastful one", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a child who had accomplished something: you were proud of him, even if it wasn't really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Though it was his own creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, she and her daughter were rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me it was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning were slowly being absorbed and released from her system.
She died shortly before and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going to happen.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people in a situation.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - despite the suffering she had endured.
"No one knew", she said.
I kept my head down and I cried.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
I realized that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The links of grieving women prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who came for the suicide of their loved ones try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting links to the Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up every room.
But he gave up his work before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have a chain effect".
Mrs. Davis created the links to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not sit silently − you must speak.
Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in full daylight - when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them or anything else.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get over it: it would create a hole throughout the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought if we could actually achieve something he asked for - a time or scope-limited investigation - we could agree on something", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would "disintegrate" amid the obstacles.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th - if, as expected, the Republicans don't succeed, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is set to vote.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn the inconclusive result and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors decreases under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors are stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by the carriers.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the suspended denuclearization talks.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on a broader nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ji said that the lack of progress was due to US sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did it, they'd call her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking when discussing his family and high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a "grotesque and coordinated type of assassination" organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Mrs. Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't serve on the Supreme Court because it would show he's biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified by these statements and the way he's persecuting the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was evasive when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll tell you one thing, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but he's not fit to be on the court that he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she considers herself a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided questions during his hearings about whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Yeah, isn't that wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate attack, months and years of uncontrollable rage, and she can't talk about it without crying.
"When we get angry, we cry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, is it?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she started using a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great.
Tears are partly allowed as an outlet for anger because they are extremely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my early work in a predominantly male office, where I once cried with indescribable fury, is when an older woman, the cold-blooded manager I'd always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the handcuff and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they got under your skin.
Patricia Schroeder, the future Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his run for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the game, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, she was behind in raising funds, so she promised not to enter the game unless she won $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000 would have given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm the one with the discount?" she wondered.
During her speech about not running for office, she was so overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to get money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she choked.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder said of the press reaction.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my headstone.
The one who cried?
How can a U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The initial rumblings of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the dispute between the countries may be a long-term benefit to Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively cutting half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way each time, recently raising tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to accommodate the US tactics, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to recover so soon.
To achieve Washington's concession would mean yielding to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, a public US compliment would be even more embarrassing.
Nevertheless, experts argue that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic turmoil in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than we've observed before", said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem, in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly, said that conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation is more stable and safer on the ground thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup tournament in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to overtake the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole and gave up his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth, an American, was eliminated by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has been beaten 2-1 by Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the record European tournament winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
"It's about the team, I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said, emotional after winning the European Championship.
He handed the baton to his countryman John Ram, who beat American golfing legend Tiger Woods by two holes with one hole remaining in Sunday's singles game.
"When I beat Tiger Woods, I feel incredible pride, I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup tournament records.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find the right course except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. Army, after a disappointing performance, came out to his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, the time has come to make Europe uncomfortable.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna re-create the team, I'm gonna work with the PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to have been captain.
Hats off to you.
You beat us.
Current status of red sludge: Concentrations are declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in red manure concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier areas, uneven coating conditions have been reported, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The red mud affects approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
The stains can be found about 10 miles off the coast in the Hillsborough area, but in fewer places than last week.
Red sputum has also been spotted in the Pasco area.
Medium concentrations on or off shore in the Pinellas area were reported last week, low to high concentrations in the sea in the Hillsborough area, high concentrations in the Manatee area, high concentrations on or off shore in the Sarasota area, medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, high concentrations on or off shore in the Lee area, and low concentrations in the Collier area.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
No respiratory distress has been reported in northwest Florida in the last week.
