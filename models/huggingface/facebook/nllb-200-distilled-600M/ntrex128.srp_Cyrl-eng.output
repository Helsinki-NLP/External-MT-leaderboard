Members of the Welsh congregation are concerned about the similarity with the Mapetites
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) were dismissed with a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was because the name of the congregation was to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assemblies of all political parties are concerned that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party congress stated that his party was concerned that this acronym was derived from Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means shash, and pwp means scrap.
A member of the assembly from the political party Plaid stated that the group as a whole was more satisfied and suggested alternative names.
A Welsh Conservative Party member said his group was open to a name change, but noted that the MWP is pronounced similarly to Muppet (Mappets).
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh word w is similar to the pronunciation of the word u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law to introduce the name change, issued the following statement: "The final decision on the description of the title of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultations on general proposals for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the title of Member of Parliament, the Commission chose the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP option, but the MWP option received the widest support in public consultations.
Members of the assembly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be headache-stricken for the chairwoman, Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law within weeks.
Reform laws will also include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules for disqualifying congregation members and a plan for the committee system.
Members of the assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the name of the state
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the new name of the state Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province under the name Macedonia.
Athens has long held the position that the name of the neighboring northern states represents its territory and has persistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have died, and the churches of Harlem are struggling to survive
"Old people I spoke to say that there were once cafes and churches on every street", says Mr. Adams.
"There is no one else today".
He understands the lack of caffeine.
He says that people today are dealing with people in a different way.
Cafans no longer play the role of day laborers from neighborhoods where people regularly go.
As for churches, they fear that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders expect it sooner or later to be back at the beginning.
Churches, he added, could be replaced with residential buildings with homes full of the kind of people who won't help the rest of the neighborhood's shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and this will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these housing facilities will become their members".
Both churches built communities of white people before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist community moved in the 1930's.
A black community that held worship nearby took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's took over a black community under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, opposing the hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parish decided to repair it and ordered the organ.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the orchestra the poor orchestra.
The artist who played the organ in July called them differently: cultural grace and irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that these were the first organ in the world to be played by a black musician, Dioniscio A. Lind, who had moved to the larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Meriwether stated that St. Martin had not replaced him.
What has taken place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by world church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish administration, a parish governing body made up of world leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would attempt to transfer the costs to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the opacity of the work of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old girl during a hay fever in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was scuba diving in California for his raccoons on the opening day of raccoons' season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was scuba diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday when he heard the boy's calls for help, and then drove him to the water with the group to get him out.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a matter of getting excited about the stork's catch, but then he realized that it was screaming, 'She bit me!
She Bit Me'
Members of the assemblies of all political parties are concerned that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
I called out to all to come out of the water: 'A shark is in the water!' Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark attacked him.
Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic upper torso injuries.
For investigation and security, officials have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles points out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's becomes a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department stores specializing in cosmetics in the style of department stores.
As part of a significant breakthrough in the UK cosmetics market that will turn over £2.8 billion, with sales in the fashion and home appliance markets falling, larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and open in more stores next year if proven successful.
Cosmetic investment comes from supermarkets finding ways to use shelf space after a lawsuit for TVs, microwave tubes, and home appliances.
Commercial chain Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its cosmetics offering to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product packs from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching the Boutique makeup palette to make most products suitable for vegans  as demand grows when it comes to younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test out the stores at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the daily shift to small amounts of food in local stores mean that supermarkets must also work hard to attract people to visit.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's retail chain, stated that the department store outlet will increasingly remind of self-service as the supermarket chain tries to counter the hit to retailers with large discounts from Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which it says has increased sales of food products and profitability of procurement.
A previous attempt by this supermarket to modernize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments has ended in disgrace.
The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after winning revenue sharing from pharmaceutical stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes to a head after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical company to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a better environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be at our service to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an unforgettable destination for cosmetic products that set new standards for how to shop.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby's £11million retirement
Peter Jones, star of the series Dragons Den, became infuriated after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the $11 million business with his personal brand to focus on new deals with companies Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home appliances and Truly.
The couple's company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The driver, 37, posted her departure this morning via social networking site Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of the series "Dragons" Denny, by withdrawing at the last minute from profitable work with their brand to focus on her own new revenue deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was upset when a TV screen favourite during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new offers worth up to £1.5m there was no longer enough time to devote to their brand of home and accessories Truly.
The company had partnered with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Wiloby, 37, posted via Instagram to leave Truly, Jones left Britain for one of her weekends.
According to the source, Holly has made Truly a top priority.
This was to be her long-term plan for earning a living in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was a disaster for everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is stocked with slaves ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home appliances, as well as possible delays to launch dates.
This could also mark the end of a long-standing friendship.
Wilobie, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tarom Cap, for ten years.
Wiloby founded Truly with Kapov in 2016, and in March, Jones, 52, joined them as the company's CEO.
The couple spend the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin TV's production house.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Eunt McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We don't want to comment on his business".
After harsh words, sympathy was expressed
He has been criticized in the media for comments that some consider to be unworthy of the president and for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so retiring?
Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
I am not withdrawing from anything.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no "appropriate reaction" by the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States is not lifting sanctions that are under constant pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are making great progress with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
We now have a wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results. Rocket tests were completed, the towels were released, and the remaining American troops were returned home.
This unusual approach was defended by Kim in her relationship.
"It's so easy to be a good president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this short arena, about 200 people would be standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so we face some difficulties", Ms. Sambung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palma, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palau to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in providing relief.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes that are shaking Indonesia, it is a pity that this country is unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coasts.
The loss of life was likely also contributed by the apparent failure of the Palau tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between the many Indonesian islands and beyond presents a challenge.
Natural disasters add to the logistics.
A hospital ship stationed on Lombok Island to assist earthquake victims is en route to Palá, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's enduring infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds hit Mr. Joko's administration, and he is up for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using swords, bows, and arrows and other crude weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturge manages to score a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Stirridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received an extra from Jordan Shastri on a 27-yard field goal from Chelsea when his team lost 1-0.
He first moved the ball to the left side, then rushed to the farthest part of the net.
The strap went high above the net in the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, she flew over Cape Arisabalagu, which jumped to catch her and fell into the net.
I was just trying to put up and put up for the strike, and players like Shakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get out for as long as possible", Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant coming closer, I touched one ball and it just went off, without much thought".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue's striker returned the ball to Mateusz Kovacic fifth, then turned in the middle of the field and ran to Liverpool's half.
The pitcher gave a few short blows in the middle of the field.
He then fired a shiny centershot, pointing Azar toward the naked.
Azar overtook the defense and took the final shot with his left foot into the farthest part of the net next to Liverpool player Allison Baker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet the VideoTone in the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to a disaster management agency statement Sunday morning.
Numerous reports have been received of people trapped in the ruins of buildings affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo agency spokesman Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palú, with a population of more than 380,000, has been hit by the remnants of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Berkshire, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. beaten at Grayson Muse's location on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people in the area who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would call anyone who was near John Street in Berkshire and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found alive in Berkshire was found at the property.
Later this afternoon, friends who thought they knew this woman came to the scene to ask where the morning was found.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently notifying the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Museum had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that everyone was forbidden to enter and leave the building.
He was left without a text when he learned what had happened.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to return in a few hours.
A police officer was reported to have told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene.
She repeatedly said: "This is terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were at the border with another van ahead.
A few policemen stood at the border guarding the housing blocks.
Anyone with any information is invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers Association at 0800 555 111 and state record 247 as of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in front of the Parliament Building is the subject of the latest debate on monuments over the debate over falsifying history
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-style destruction of many of the English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as a madness and an attempt to falsify history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was an inevitable goal in the current debate on the removal of the statue.
Cromwell neither gave orders nor fought iconic battles during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent Cromwell exhibition by Sir William Hamoe Turnickcroft testifies to 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure who, according to many, still deserves to be magnified.
Mr Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
The reliability of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His successes as Lord Protector also deserve to be magnified and preserved from oblivion.
A pig-killer inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer attacked and killed a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The male, identified only by his surname Juan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pig in a market in the city of Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
A pig farm owner is preparing to inject pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly came with a relative from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a relative grabbed him dead and noticed the door of a neighbor's piglet open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig inflicted fatal injuries on a farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crippled", said a cousin named Vu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Juan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Jonah or his relative.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent further attacks, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Juan's family and the market officials are reportedly negotiating a ransom for his death.
Although this is rare, there have been recorded cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to suffer serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 200-pound pig held a Welsh farmer by his tractor until his wife removed the animal.
After Oregon farmers ate pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be oxidative.
They're just playing.
They like to grill, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to treat them with respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Ross will bring widespread plumes to the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring tidal plumes to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Ross, with winds of 137 km/h (130 mph), was a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday morning at 5 a.m. eastern time and was located 620 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of the settlement of Punta Euhenia, Mexico.
Ross expects to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward, toward the west coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture from contact with the approaching low-pressure field will lead to widespread plumes in the southwest.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous flash floods, waterborne breakdowns, and the possibility of desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will locally cause rainfall of about 5 to 8 inches per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, are also expected to experience 5 to 10 inches of rain.
Flooding is possible with rapid deterioration due to the unprovoked nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely unwise to walk in the desert while threatened by tropical rain.
As a result of heavy rainfall, canyons can become mechanical rivers, and thunderstorms will result in stormy winds and dust in the air.
The approaching low-pressure field will bring locally heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of southern California.
Over 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause less water breakage and slip of the railway.
This will be the first rainfall in the region for their rainy season.
Tropical storm surges will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and rainfall will cover the wider area on Monday evening and Tuesday.
The sweep will extend to the southwestern part of Colorado, southeastern part of Utah, northeastern part of Arizona, and northwestern part of New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature oscillations across the United States are possible as the Arctic cools, while fairly warm weather will remain in the tropics.
This sometimes causes huge temperature differences over short distances.
A striking example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees.
The long-term summer heat will rise and spread again in the next few days.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
The temperature in New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the broadcast of Brett Kavanagh
More than 20 million people on six television channels watched the exciting testimony of Supreme Court Justice nominees Bret Kavanagh and Christine Blaise Ford, women who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly in the 1980's.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with television stations disrupting regular Friday programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh was touching her and trying to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartwarming testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It was likely seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
It calculated the average television viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
However, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office viewership.
For comparison, that number of viewers can match the audience watching a football playoff game or an Oscar.
The Fox News Channel, with the hosts of the show Opinion strongly supporting Kavanagh's nomination, recorded the highest viewing of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
This process sparked great interest after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in the drama that took place on Friday.
After a statement from the moderate Republican office that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh was made, CNN and CBS television cameras recorded protesters screaming at him on Friday morning as he tried to ride an elevator to the Justice Committee hearing.
He was standing for several minutes in a low-pitched gaze as he was being taunted, which CNN broadcast live.
"I stand before you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
They said to him, "You have power, and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations broadcast the events live hours later when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to move Kavanaugh's candidacy to a full-scale Senate decision.
However, Flake said he would only agree to this on the condition that the FBI investigate allegations against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority has insisted.
Flake was partially convinced by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Kunse and several other senators after him, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was weighty, and it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve the Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of playing politics in the Brexit case
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview besides her front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checker's plan for Brexit, calling the proposal for a single customs zone for Britain and the EU completely meaningless.
Wade Sims murder: Police arrested suspect Dayton Simpson for the death of a University of Louisiana player
Police arrested a suspect in the gunman's death, Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video footage of the Sims-Simpson confrontation and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
Police found the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, a CBS-affiliated channel.
After questioning Simpson, police said that he admitted to shooting Wade to death.
He was given a $350,000 bail, the lawyer said.
The parish office of East Baton Rouge's pathologist released a preliminary report Friday citing a gunshot wound to the head to the neck as the cause of death.
The services to assist in the investigation that led to the arrests are attributed to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Capture Operations Unit, the State Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents.
The athletic director at the University of Louisiana, Joe Aleva, praised local law enforcement for their efforts to enforce the law on gambling and the pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3, 200-pound winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "necessary and shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's something that's always bothering us", Wade said.
A volcano hurls ash on Mexico City
The ash that drives the Popocateptel volcano has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday because of increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
This center has recorded more mild seismic activity.
In social media images, thin layers of ash were visible on windshields in Mexico City municipalities such as Hocomilico.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with the intervention police, while thousands joined counter-demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalan vote of secession that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, restrained by the intervention police, were beaten with eggs and painted in the dust, and dark clouds of dust formed on the streets that are usually the tops of tourists.
Later in the day, police arrested the pedrews.
Independent groups chanted for hours, "No forgetting, no forgiveness" facing unionist protesters who shouted: "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received help for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
The tension in the region designated for independence does not subside for a year after the referendum held on October 1, which the separatist Catalans celebrate, although Madrid has declared it illegal.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although the response was small as a mass of people who opposed secession boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police forces.
Demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
 Last year we had one of the brightest moments.
My parents cried out for happiness that they could vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation", he said.
Despite achieving key but close victories in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have had difficulty maintaining the same spirit this year as many of their most prominent leaders have been in self-imposed exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is all over the place", he said.
Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, has announced that he will run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Finding a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the suppression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they had broken into a house in London several times.
The incident occurred on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent Street around 7:30pm British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings stated that the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that a suicide bombing has occurred at some point in the home.
Mange's season brings Livingston to a 1-0 win over Rangers
Mengo's Valley secured the win with the first goal for Livingston
Livingston surprised Rangers by forcing Steven Gerrard to admit only his second 18-game defeat as the club's manager at Ibrox Stadium.
The Manga Valley made a difference with its goal as Gary Holt's team matched Hibernian in second place.
Gerardov's team this season is undefeated in the Premier League, and next week he meets the leaders of the Hartz table, for whom he is eight points short.
Before that, Rangers will be joined by Rapid Beach in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended their division record to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed out on uninspired guests
Holt had to lead the team long before the impact he achieved, as the offensive game had caused Rangers problems at all levels.
Scott Robinson broke, but carried the ball in front of him, to shoot Alan Lithgow by the net after he slipped to receive a blow to Craig Halkett's head in front of him.
The hosts were happy to let Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could make the host team difficult with action.
In this way, they achieved a key goal.
Rangers committed the offense, and Livingston opened the game after a free-throw by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to score a pass to Meng who passed the ball to the goal from mid-season.
In the previous part of the game, Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
The same style continued in the second half, though Kelly had to defend one of Alfred Morelos's blows.
Alan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper, repulsed Scott Pittman's attack and shot Litgo next to the goal in Livingston's second innings.
Livingston defended several centre-half goals, and two of the penalty kicks were also rejected after Halcott's bid to replace Glenn Middleton and one for a hand-held game.
The phenomenal game of Livingstone's analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony MacAroni Stadium
A phenomenal event and result for Livingston.
All the players, without exception, were exceptional and once again exceeded expectations on this climbing journey.
Since returning to the front lines they have not changed the style of play and the people, but great credit should be given to Holt for the way he brought life to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halket was uncompromising in leading a highly organized defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Vral on standby at all times.
However, Rangers was not inspired.
Although he was once good at Gerard, he fell well below that level.
They couldn't score  they only broke the home defense once  and that's kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan encountered a mass reception in Cologne
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) during a breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdogan then headed to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police blocked 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
The calls of hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect a split opinion about a visitor who some Turks in Germany consider a hero and others accuse of being an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: A bicycle rider dies in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash happened near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on the Deptford Highway, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the hospital staff pointed to him for help, but the man died on the spot.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday crash, which was hit and run by a driver.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the man and notify his immediate relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers were injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison said.
The ongoing riot occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British Summer Time.
A team of Tornado specialists is brought in to deal with the unrest that is reduced to a single wing and involves eight prisoners.
Officers were given on-site assistance for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison officials have been brought in for the current incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six crew members received help from injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and our view is clear that those responsible will be reported to the police, which could keep them behind bars for longer.
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the police intervention was called to prison for serious riots in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with heavy flooding (which can well reach areas affected by drought)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to hit early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert to the southwest, carrying with it the risks of heavy flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will be heralded by rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 60 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit a region 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rainfall, with amounts as high as 15 inches in isolated places, such as Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert to the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it will likely be 2.55 cm, with possible total amounts in isolated places and up to 10 cm.
For areas not afraid of heavy rains, Rosa's offer can be a blessing given that the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious cause for concern, rainfall will be welcome in some areas because the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drylands Monitoring Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit at least by extreme, second-order drought, reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Ross first leads to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of California's Lower Peninsula.
Ross, which continued to have strong winds of up to 135 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is currently 620 miles (620 km) south of the Mexican settlement of Punta Euhenia and moving north at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
The owl encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, and it loses its strength.
So the Mexico landslide is expected to hit when the storm reaches tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible, posing a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 8 to 15 inches of rainfall is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of the Sonora state, with as much as 10 inches, reports weather.com.
Ross will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then moving up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger expected from Ross or her remains is very heavy rainfall in California's Lower Valley, northwestern Sonora and the American desert in the southwest, the National Hurricane Tracking Center reported.
This rainfall is expected to lead to life-threatening flooding and the dispersal of water crushes in deserts and wetlands in hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 British Summer Time.
He was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition.
During the night a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police asked anyone who might have a recording of the incident on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the scourge and fury of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had suffered the mischief and fury of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
In a vigorous and emotional testimony Thursday before Congress, Kavanaugh denied Christine Blaise Ford's claims that she had been sexually abused by her as teenagers decades ago.
At this hearing, Ford testified.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw all the genius, quality and courage of the Kavanaugh that day.
"The positive voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for one of the most realistic legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-rate biography in public service", he declared before a gathering of supporters in West Virginia.
The chairman briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the significance of the Republican's response to the midterm elections.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running, he said.
"So I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump concluded that the Democrats were on a mission to push back and disrupt.
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected Friday at the latest, according to a senior GOP leadership aide for CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia left hundreds dead, and the number continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many by giant waves that hit the beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palá on Friday for a beach festival when a six-meter-high wave hit the coast at dawn, causing many to die and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was accompanied by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of running away immediately and thus becoming victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, in a statement to media in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it pulled cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and thus survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palá.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster relief agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seismic activity hit the coastal city again.
A series of earthquakes have affected the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy of the devastating earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical features of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a greater tsunami intensity, he said.
Nuggroho claimed that massive damage was done and pointed out that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nuggroho said that possible major losses and damage were along the coast 300 km north of the city of Palú, an area called Donggala, which is nearest the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely cut off and there was no information from the Donga, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", the statement said.
The agency received criticism from various sides on Saturday for not issuing a tsunami warning, although officials said the waves came in at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media can be heard screaming from the top floor of a building, warning people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, linking buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the reliability of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communication to be cut off around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Authorities said the army had begun sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, but that the evacuated people were still overwhelmed with food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has reopened only for arriving aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo ordered a visit to the evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
World Vision humanitarian personnel have safely arrived from Dongla to the city of Palua where employees are hiding in the shelters of a waterproof canvas placed in the office yard and on their way to the city were greeted by the horrors of destruction and desolation, Mr. Dosemba said.
They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses, he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
Even when relief groups began taking the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Palá.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of resources, supplies, and people overseas is only possible if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still characterized as a provincial disaster", said Auliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but for now there is no such status.
When the other night fell on Paula after the earthquake and tsunami that struck him on Friday, the friends and family of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would somehow miraculously escape the sad fate of natural disaster victims.
A young boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
Rescuers released a woman from the rubble on Sunday who had been trapped next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel's demolition reached the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palau who were gathering at the beach festival.
However, his messages carried only one grey label, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while loading ATMs at the Newport on the Levee facility
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who had filled a ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man ran behind the back of a Brink's employee and stole a purse of money he was supposed to put in an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is invited to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: "It will be known as Kanye West sometime".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to announce a new album, Yandhi.
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande who declined for emotional reasons, said the show's author.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think ye is the most represented word in the Bible and means ti", West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
So, I'm you, I'm all of me, that's me.
From the name Kanya, which means One, I have moved to just Ye (you)  which is the personification of all the good, bad, and unclear in us.
This album is, in essence, a reflection of who we are.
He is just one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, known by the nicknames Puff Daddy, Pi DiDi or Diddy, this year has voiced his desire to be referred to as Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother Love).
A former West's associate, J.J.Z., used a nickname with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO denies using the military against civilians
Former Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians at the 50th anniversary of the bloody student retaliation in this country.
Lopez Obrador pledged at the Tlatelolco market on Saturday that he would never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at peaceful protesters gathered in the marketplace and killed as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were forming in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial aid to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the inability to get an education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its AI resources
As China becomes more active in AI development, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments followed after various U.S. government agencies announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan: its goal is to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"It would be good to double the AI research budget for a start, given that all other countries are so behind on the U.S. and we're looking to make new strides in this area", Lee said.
By doubling the funding, it could double the chance that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Super Power of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, serves as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the U.S. Department of Defense's Agency for the Advancement of New Technologies (DARPA) Robot Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Lee said.
'They are not academic leaders in China, they are going to big corporations,' he declared.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years hired prominent university minds to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
Lee points out that changes to immigration policies could help the United States strengthen its aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think the green cards should be automatically offered to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a plan for the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to include partners from the industry and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called 'New Generation Artificial Intelligence'.
On the other hand, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the state
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their candidates for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern country represents its own territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would threaten the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, majority-Slav population.
President Georgy Ivanov has stated that he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The referendum question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of agreements with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership of alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that followed the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would be hearing the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
'I went to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,' said Joshe Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dusko, voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which should pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, prepares a small bin and places chairs in front of tents set up by opponents of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the right-wing leaders, not through entry into service", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership would bring over the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will be ZA because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO membership, ZA stressed after the vote.
He added that the result would be a guarantee of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma, concluded that 57 percent of voters would vote in the referendum.
Of these, 70 percent declared themselves to be giving the voice of ZZ.
To be successful, the referendum would require half of the registered voters plus one to vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of a Western government since taking power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defence of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dominated Brighton's defence on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, taking a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
It seemed too easy when Aguero hit the ground in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received an addition to the center of the field from where he started the attack.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players, then knocked out the line in the open.
Then the Aguieras were surrounded by four green shirts.
He played one defensive player, then overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
He then threw the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English winger immediately returned the ball to Aguero, who had beaten Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right kick, by shooting into the right side of the net.
Aguero has some foot problems, Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That was true.
We were lucky to have him score a goal at that point.
However, the Skycaps' initial advantage in the Premier League was brought by Sterling.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received a ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He made a beautiful addition to the LeRoy Seine on his left side.
Shane had several ball contacts before mentioning Sterling in the second article.
The Skyblue attacker threw the ball into the net, immediately sliding out of the field.
Manchester City meet Hoffenheim at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon in a Champions League group match at the Rhein-Necker Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies in a game without any competitive significance for the Nationals
Since the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to insist on another game.
However, the competitive-minded Scherzer hopes to take the position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to win their first division title.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably be at the highest level against any point I play this year.
Why would I not participate in such a race?
The National League has not yet announced a starter for the week, but they are reportedly considering letting Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the 34th to open the game, had a practice Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he's otherwise out.
The right-hander from Washington this season leads 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The chairman briefly referred to the situation in which his Supreme Court justice candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, is in during a speech on the significance of the Republican's appeal in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have achieved will be put on the line in November.
Five weeks are a long way from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
These are some of the biggest  although I am not running personally, I am actually running and therefore I am fighting for excellent candidates everywhere , he said.
Trump continues: "Look at this horrible radical Democratic group, look at what's happening now.
They are determined to regain power without choosing the means, seeing evil, filthy games.
They do not care who they will hurt, whom they must trample down to gain power and control, for they want power and control, and we will not give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to push the resistance and disrupt.
"You can see that in the past four days", he said, calling the Democrats "blasphemous, evil, ugly and dishonest".
He named Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud public outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you made the document available to the public?
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, I'm waiting for him  it was very bad body language  worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinion
When activists at Momentum in my local party voted for my censorship, I was almost not surprised.
I am just the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they were not welcome  just because we were expressing our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan River, suffered similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The irony about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe  is that these are similar issues that Jeremy did not discuss with previous leaders.
The announcement for the meeting at the Labour Party in East Nottingham on Friday said we hope the meetings will be comprehensive and productive.
For the eight years I have been a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the general committee meetings on Friday evenings have been largely like this.
Sadly, meetings in that spirit are seldom held today, and the promise of more gentle, moderate politics has long been forgotten, if ever.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared similar political views began to expect me to change them radically and take positions I would never otherwise agree with  whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every public address I make, regardless of what I say, follows a social media abuse ring calling for the annulment of my election, condemns the policies of the Centre, and announces that I have no place in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one with such experience.
I realize that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments are of a typical political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, and I never let that bother them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various forms of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we no longer accept different views, and with every vote of no confidence or change in election rules, the party becomes more and more confused.
For the past two years, I have often been advised, urging me to lower my head, keep my opinion to myself, and then be calm.
But it does not go far with my political goals.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school club, provoked by Margaret Thatcher's governmental negligence in allowing my school classroom to literally collapse, I have endeavored to strive to provide better public services to those most in need  whether as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my political resolve, not even in the next election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and issues on which I disagree with current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just like to say that at a time when our country is moving towards Brexit that will threaten households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to the Nottingham Moment but to my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to overthrow my election or political ambition will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Air climbs to the top
Two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr took a well-deserved victory in this exciting match of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
They now topped the charts, as the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the home team took the lead thanks to superior defense, as well as the greater number of chances taken, and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in the previous games and we haven't lost yet, so I have to be content", he said.
Robin Christy of the Melrose team stated: "All praise to Air, they took their chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, converted by Fraser Climax, gave Ayr an edge, but the yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hugh, who was knocked out by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical edge and Jason Bagot grabbed the uncredited essay.
The climate boosted Ayr's lead by a penalty, before, at halftime, he scored and converted a solo essay to bring Ayr on a 17-5 break.
However, Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's essay, which he turned into a bagot, cut the deficit to five points.
Then came a long pause due to the serious injury of Ruard Notes, who was carried on the carrier, and Ayr further increased his lead with Stafford McDowell's essay, which Climate turned.
Air's vice-captain, Blair McPherson, was then given the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player's advantage more by Bruce Colvin failing to turn the essay, after less violent pressure.
However, the host side returned and when Straun Hutchinson was given a yellow card for wrestling with Clim without a ball, from the foam line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Moal Ayr in the attack.
Climax turned the essay, which he did again almost immediately onwards, after Kyle Rowe picked up a hit from David Armstrong and sent the wing of Gregor Henry for the fifth home-court essay.
The star of the series Still Game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the series Still Game, Ford Kiernan, is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed to the board of directors of a company that owns licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old interpreter portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he co-wrote and stars alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final season and it appears that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craig Lang.
He is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the successful restaurant sector in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, whose access to the sea has been denied, hopes that the court will allow it to return to the Pacific
The Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flags of the ocean are displayed on public buildings.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are labeled with the motto: "We have a lot of right to the sea.
We owe it to him.
In Bolivia, which has been denied access to the sea, there are still vivid memories of the loss of the coastline in the 19th-century resource conflict with Chile, and with it the longing for another navigable Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits an October 1 decision by the International Court of Justice after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia's current development is on hand, governed by a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects a positive outcome, said Roberto Calzadilia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that a tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that after decades of talks Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
For Eva Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin who is expected to face a controversial re-election battle next year, the ruling to be handed down on Monday also carries many risks.
We were very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia  and that little will change when that happens.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and stated that it will not decide on the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was more complicated, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has Bolivia's case not progressed, but it may have been overshadowed by the previous four years.
"The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration", Zarata said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric killed any inclination toward Chile, she noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries had not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velza, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court ruled unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of non-aggression with mutual benefits, he said.
Calsadil also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the sea issue as a political backdrop.
Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see the need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen if it does not trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his people will never abolish their nuclear weapons program unless they have confidence in Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore in the talks of the clashing leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have just not restarted deadly diplomatic negotiations on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri says it's just a dream that continuing sanctions and opposing the US declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is generally skeptical of Pyongyang's seriousness in denying its nuclear arsenal, which its country likely sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines showcase the latest line of glossy head covering accessories that you will soon see on the nearby main street
If you want to enrich your hat collection with glossy models or completely block the sun, the search is over.
Designer Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of huge head-mounted accessories from their 2019 Spring/Summer collection on the track that overshadowed everything at Paris Fashion Week.
The latest non-practical hats have caught the eye of Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their impressive creations on the fashion track.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was the high-pitched runny hat decorated with a wide feather-like skirt that swallowed the model's head.
Other glossy additions included jewelry-decorated sponges, magic hats, and even pineapple but not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled a diving kit with a breathing apparatus and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cornet.
And if you stick to the trend of attracting attention to glamorous fashion details, you're in luck.
Trends-followers predict that huge hats will soon be worn on nearby main streets.
The glamorous hats follow the emergence of the popular straw hat La Bomba with a wingspan of two meters that has been worn by many famous personalities  from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult label on this impractical hat, which has flooded social networks, stood behind another large creation depicted on the slopes  the straw beach bags are almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
In James's collection La Riviera for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week, the most prominent was a burnt orange raffie bag, surrounded by raffia and with a white leather strap on top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect big beach hats and bags next summer to arrive on Main Street  given that the designer has made such a boom, it would be hard to ignore such a demand for glossy accessories.
John Edward: Knowledge of language is key to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland can boast outstanding academic achievement, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test scores, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, a career of choice, and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can devise and implement its own curriculum and curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for pupils in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will go into their head.
If you speak his mother tongue, it will touch his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we are to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
Based on recent test results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received a higher grade point average.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received higher A-scores from Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 percent attributed language skills to language skills for reasons employers cited as a major problem when filling vacancies.
Thus, language skills are increasingly being given importance in preparing young people for future careers.
Given the more potential job opportunities that languages require, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future because he will have a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to be involved in language learning.
Learning more than one language, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children greater opportunities to find meaningful employment.
Each school in Scotland will have different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will focus on languages considered to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a choice of languages, with a teaching staff that is proficient in that area.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever the future holds.
There is no denying that languages are still crucial to the future of the country in today's global business environment, and they must have a place in education.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered a sign of international communication.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and outstanding achievement for young people in Scotland.
I need to do it well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for fans who want to see Lebron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the weekly preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his exact timing remains to be determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would likely have a limited minute.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule of six games.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
Time of the Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies next week, with stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his candidacy for a vacancy on the Supreme Court postponed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
What time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely speak about this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, which have become heated by allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected vote to confirm Senate admission delayed for a week until the FBI completes the investigation.
However, this series of rallies is primarily to help Republicans gain support in the November election.
As part of President Trump's campaign, it is noted that these five rallies next week are aimed at mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, Reuters reports.
"The significance of controlling Congress is so great for its work program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the hectic election campaign season", a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters who did not want to be named.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent of the vote, will be on Saturday, the second in the last few months.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate nominee, Patrick Morrissey, who is running out of polls.
"The worst sign for Morrissey is that the president has to come in to try to get him in the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reports.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination in the fight to stay in the game in a single-elimination match on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, a Saturday afternoon couples tournament may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentary variability is a fictional sporting concept, players do believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So on whose side would you say that now is the time?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so it's kind of a moment on our side", Jordan Spit said at the departure.
Europe, of course, is ahead of us with four points of advantage and a further twelve in play.
While Americans, according to Spit, get a little wind in their backs and have a lot on their side, especially the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each had three points out of four.
Spit was killed from first to last and gave everyone homework.
The effects of enthusiasm became more and more pronounced during his round, so he finally played the key final stroke and got the fourth pitch with the same result when he and Thomas were down by two for two.
His final blow to the 15-hole sword was met with a similar scream, reflecting the belief that the American team was not failing.
"Basically, you just have to do your best and take care of your own sword", Spit said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to leave the seal.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual and equally charming European couple won all four swords and played without mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple that did not play the goddamn hits on Saturday afternoon, but they also skipped them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at 2:30 a.m. on Friday morning.
The game they have so far shown and the way they exchange energy with the noisy crowd have cemented them as the main favourites of the week and there is no more popular player from Fleetwood or Molinaria who could carry a potential European victory in the sunset over the grounds of the Le Golf National club.
If possible, both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European fame.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole from which they never managed to emerge.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
The four-ball game and the pair tournament are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great lead before the final day, but this session of the pair tournament also showed that the U.S. team has a desire for combat that some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10-6 before final day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead, having gained a 10-6 lead over the United States in the four-ball game and the pairings tournament after Saturday's swords.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the first with two victories over the uncomfortable Tiger Woods, increasing the previous record at the Le Golf National Club's grounds by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who were struggling to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in the morning game with four balls and won the series 3-1.
The United States offered greater resistance to the pairings tournament, winning two swords, but could not reduce the draw.
Jim Furyk's side must score eight points in 12 singles in a single game on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Mollywood after a fantastic weekend, are only the second couple in Ryder Cup history to score four points in the first four editions.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then teamed up and defeated the bouncy Woods and American starter Bryson DeShambo with an even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who pulled through two swords on Saturday, was brilliant at the time, but now has lost 19 of 29 in a four-ball game and a pair-to-seven-in-a-row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the doubles tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keke first and third on the world rankings.
Yet, Europe did not go as planned on this pleasant, hail-like day southwest of Paris.
Triple Majors tournament winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They narrowly chose a 2-1 win over John Ram and Jan Pulter in a four-ball game, to later come back and beat Pulter and Rory McCelroy 4-3 in the pairings tournament, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a team returned after a four-point lead to a single sword, although Furyk's defending champion side is in enough relay to retain the trophy.
However, after two days in another place, it seems that the Sunday counterattack would be beyond their means.
North Korea says it will not talk about unilateral disarmament unless there is confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken significant measures over the past year to show goodwill, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear testing site, and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no corresponding U.S. response", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no talk of us first unilaterally disarming ourselves.
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-out approach to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded for its steps, his statement was significant because it did not throw unilateral denuclearization out of the game as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea demanded a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also deafened to calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is not giving up on denuclearization above all else and is increasing the level of pressure on sanctions to force its goal, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
Thinking that sanctions can get us down on our knees is just a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that prolonging sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke of at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we negotiate this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not come to such a head".
Nevertheless, the tone of Rio's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that a U.S. land-based missile strike on North Korea was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim "raketashem" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was much more to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea does denuclearize.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set a time frame for this, saying: "If it's going to last two years, three years or five months  it doesn't matter.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must continue to be strict and unconditionally enforced until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rome past the UN General Assembly and afterwards announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, to be condemned by North Korea after only a few hours for making gangster demands.
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile site, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He stated that Kim told him that the appropriate measures demanding the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington were being taken.
Harvard students take a class on getting enough sleep
This year's new course at Harvard University aims to force students to get more sleep in an effort to root out the increasingly popular catchy culture of studying all night with the help of caffeine.
One academic noted that the number one university students in the world are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Chazler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, devised the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for this course after a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
One girl finally came up to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing this now, my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
This year's course, which is the first of its kind, teaches students the basics of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and athletic outcomes and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says that the university decided to introduce this course after observing that students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section features a picture of a room in a student home, and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants will hear how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We are aware that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know this - just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking", added Professor Chazler.
The culture of pride in 'sleeping all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be a secret weapon for students in their fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, even against excess weight, since the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode and they are therefore constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Chazler conceive the course after attending one of his lectures last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He says that this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its campus-wide maintenance.
The next step, hopefully, would be for all postgraduates to be required to pass a similar study program before entering a competing institution.
Professor Chazler advised students to consider setting alarms at bedtime and wake-up time and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mengo defeated Gerard's team by a goal
Rangers experienced another guest decline when Dolly Mengo shot off Steven Gerrard's dissolved team in a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The Ibrox Stadium team struggled to take their first guest win after a 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team hired Gerard as manager for only their second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the outgoing Ladbrokes Premier League leader, Harts.
The manga was shot seven minutes before halftime, and Rangers' uninspired stance never came close to being tied.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third behind Hibernian just because of the difference in goals.
Rangers may face additional problems after linebacker Calum Spence had to be referred for help with a head wound after being thrown overboard with an object.
Gerard made eight tries in the team that beat Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, identified himself as the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from Hartz last week and would be thrilled with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated the property, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was only two minutes short of reaching the goal after Meng sent Scott Pittman to score Alan McGregor with his first pass into the empty space, but the midfielder missed a big chance and shot next to the goal.
Kagan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett with a deep free throw, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow shot next to the goal at the other end.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their play in the back line gave more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received the penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawless clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request
Rangers scored just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox Stadium goalkeeper Liam Kelly successfully defended Lasana Coolidge's headstroke and shortened the shot to Ovi Eyaria.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true balance of power during the game, no one can deny that he was deserved for anything but the hard work involved.
The Rangers again could not cope with Jacobs' deep-played action.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pulled the ball to Slott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng for the simple finish.
Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coolidge and that replacement almost immediately yielded a result when the wingman recruited Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to urge guests to play just as they liked, with long balls from Lithgow and Halketh.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the lead at the last minute, but McGregor held up well and defended Jacobs' attack, then sent Lithgow from the corner with his head to the ball next to the goal.
Glen Middleton, a substitute for Rangers, asked for another penalty at the end of the game when he hung up with Jacobs, but Thompson again did not respond.
Almanac: The Deceiver of the Geiger Count
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main strengths of science, the Geiger count has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Coronation Bell, which starred the seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Male: What's that to you?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms by the radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: Oh, that really sounds!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize damaged cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and kill defective cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize damaged cells in treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then detect a protein common to many cancers and then inject it again
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
In one woman who received a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer was withdrawn for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so they can detect a protein that occurs in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.
HER2 promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been shown to be effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the fierce attacks in Trump's defense, wearing a MAGA-labeled hood, after a guest appearance on SNL's show.
It Didn't Go Well
Kanye West was taken into the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and stated that he would run for political office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, titled Ghost Town, with a duck with the slogan Make America Great, he delivered a harsh speech against the Democrats and again provided support for Trump.
I've talked to white people so many times they'd say, "How can you support Trump when he's racist?"
If I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago, he said.
SNL broadcast a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blaise Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted a video of West's violent speech on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to mock Vesta by this announcement.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of the hoods he wore.
I was thrown behind the scenes.
They told me: 'Don't go out with that duck.'
They threatened me!
And then they say I drowned, he said, reports the Washington Examiner.
The news continued, "Do you want to see what this looks like?" adding that Superman's cloak will be removed because it means you can't order me.
Then spread the love.
The audience at least twice scoffed at his tails and seemed to be uncomfortable with the members of the SNL cast, reports Variety, while one of the presenters stated for this magazine: "The whole studio was dominated by pain".
West replaced singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mack Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with his rendition of the song I Love it, disguised in a Perrier water bottle.
The news was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank You for Not Being Good Before Evil".
However, TV host Karen Hunter wrote in her tweet that the West is simply her own and that it is absolutely beautiful.
But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) for whom I believe he accepts and loudly promotes an ideology that is bad for my community.
He is free.
The same is true of us, she added.
The rapper announced on Twitter before the show that he had changed his name, stating that he would now be known as Kanye West.
He is not the first performer to change the name  before he did it by Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed the name to the symbol and then to the performer formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred on Ballyhackamore Street, police said.
The accused are expected to appear in Belfast criminal court on Monday.
The prosecution will consider the allegations.
The star of the Game of Thrones series, Keith Harington, has condemned the deadly sword culture
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow as the swordsman in the HBO television series Game of Thrones, which depicts a medieval fantasy filled with violence.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of a cat hero, saying that because of such roles on screen, young people often feel that they have to be rude to earn respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith expressed his position that something had gone wrong and addressed the question of how to deal with the problem of the destructive sword of culture in the #JaIsto era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has a pressing need to talk about the issue.
"I personally am currently quite troubled by the question 'What did we do wrong with portraying masculinity?'", he said.
What lesson do we learn from men growing up about the problem we see now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading a destructive cat culture because of portrayals of characters who portray men.
He added: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is it that we are taught on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they must fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that this is, in fact, one of the major questions of our time. How can we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with the young man.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not accept the premise or continuation of the Game of Thrones series after its conclusion the following summer, saying that he had finished with battlefields and horses.
Keith will star in the upcoming film adaptation of Sam Shepard's True West, which will be released in November.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his current wife Rose is the best thing that the 'Game of Thrones' series has brought him.
"I met my current wife on this series, so she has given me a future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Igrit, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this Emmy-nominated fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14 percent in cases
China has reported a 14 percent jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus is transmitted through sex, a previously unusual occurrence.
HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China in the past as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way is down to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a hot issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT persons is widespread.
Studies estimate that, because of conservative views in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus often comes about because of inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff had published data on GOP senators, denouncing dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff posted personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat noted that these claims are being made by experts and ultra-right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Gray of South Carolina and of Mother Lea and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh.
The unloading came at some point after three senators examined Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Water's office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false.
The Waters statement quickly sparked condemnation on the Internet, which was also leveled by former White House press secretary Ari Flasher.
This diamond is going crazy, Flasher wrote.
This shows that she does not have the proper temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
We must not be bold.
It should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also announced on Twitter.
'A big deal if it's true,' he tweeted.
Waters said that her office had informed the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they are held accountable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English Re-enactment A light-hearted satirical spy film starring Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to seek an insinuation about Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this sequel to the satirical action comedy franchise about Johnny English, which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will the ironic auto-satire about what we are obviously garbage be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the bulky, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face was given a new opportunity to make a point  with his name more than anything indicating that it was a general comic creation conceived for territory whose cinema audience English was not a native language.
It is, of course, about an ingenious secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little Clozoo, a Mr. Bean's trunk, and the crotch of the guy who played only one note in the theme tune of the performance Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious man in an international setting who Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
There are also some scenes of noteworthy note in this latest sequel to Johnny English.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly ringed about his cock.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather nuanced and unusually superficial, especially considering that high-profile film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, now regularly include comedic elements as well.
The humor leaves the impression that it is intended for children rather than adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's wildly unfortunate accidents are not as inventive and elaborate to the point as Atkinson's gags in the silent film style when he interpreted Bina.
It is now a very topical issue that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a duty agent  unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for the prime minister, a pompous and militant figure who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the fall in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character modeled after Theresa May, but the script is rather poor.
Intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the retired.
It's the head and beard of demon Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a reputable institution but unofficially teaches lectures on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting geeks when English offers a spy academy in the spirit of the movie 'School of Rock'.
English is promptly returned to Whitehall on instructions and reunited with former patient, assistant Baugh, who is again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, interpreted by Vicky Pepperdine who is somewhat of a dry-headed man.
And so the shitty and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's secret service and congratulations to the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Boulet.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the criminal Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Beau begin their odyssey of comedic adventure: torn apart in a canopy, set fire to a glitzy French restaurant, real chaos creeping up on Walt's luxury yacht, and English sets off a real anarchy trying to get to know the inside of Walt's house using virtual reality headphones.
Obviously, much effort was put into this final sequence, but as nice and cheerful as it was, the whole film seemed to be made for children.
Pretty average quality.
As with other films about Johnny English, I cannot help but wonder: Can the British film industry think of any role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
Labour party denies making a plan for British women to work four days a week and be paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan to make British people work four days a week and be paid five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the time they save thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend but still receive the same pay.
Sources say that the idea would fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The shift to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "I expect the end of the year to be the most pre-examined of all.
The aim of the fourth industrial strategy is to achieve the objective of the party's approach to the rebalancing of resources into the use of workers, labour and general labour.
The Labour Party was the first to adopt such an idea, with Green backing out of the fourth-round Labour Party's campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, such a burden is not part of the Labour Party's reading.
The Labour Party's portrait says: 'The fourth-century work of the unity of the party is the branch of the party and the party is not a party.
The Minister of the Interior John MacDonnell used the Labour Party's long-running conference to expound his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell has made the same decision to return power to the non-executive directors and the profiteers in the public prosecution.
The Minister's plans in this sense also suggest that the current officials in the leading companies may not obtain their overall input if the Labour government is able to avoid the suspicion of unfair advances.
He also confirmed the plans of future employees in the initial management of the company and the creation of Inclusive Equity Funds, through which 10 percent of the private firm's capital would be transferred to the equity of employees who would receive a yearly dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk for 60 minutes about whether they can give us a preview of the FBI investigation into the Cavan case.
The FBI's investigation into the actual appeal against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been delayed by the court's lack of evidence regarding the final ruling of its members on the Supreme Court and the question has been raised as to whether the Bureau's further decision could affect the public's support of any Republican senators.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, reporter Scott Peele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would give them their first thought.
Kennedy was being opened up from all his friends in South Carolina.
I think, of course, Kennedy said.
As he went to the audience, he began to speak to the judge, Caphanus,
And he called all the people together, and said, Have you heard this?
He was determined, determined, unreasonable.
In the meantime, Graham's voice appears to have been thrown into the fire.
"I know all my judgment about Brett Kavanaugh and would not change it to an unexplained matter", he said.
I don't know what Dr. Ford was about, but I do know this: Brett was all determined to leave, he came to Graham, thinking of Christine Blazey Ford.
No one has ever mentioned her, and no one has been able to confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I would not say that anything new would happen to this day.
What was the Global Citizens' Festival, and did it ever lead to the removal of the slavery?
This Saturday New York will be home to the Global Citizen Festival, this year's music festival with a long and impressive list of performers and a no-brainer impressive mission to unite the world's raw artists.
The seventh annual Global Citizens' Festival at the huge Central Park venue will draw tens of thousands of people, and not just how future performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi and Sean Mendez will play out will even shift the focus on the first goal of this project, which is the ultimate goal of the 2030s.
The Global Citizens Festival, first held in 2012, is the first annual event of the Global Comparison Project, an international group of global citizens who are actively fighting for the rights of the people who are actively opposed to it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, a single ticket on the way to the festival, emails from world leaders, a telephone call or a briefing to someone else to help them reach their goal of a successful outcome.
Or, how much has the Global Citizen achieved, having in mind the 12 years remaining until the goal is achieved?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the first time that people are invited to take action, or is it just a case of so-called clichéism when people feel they have made a mistake by posting a petition or tweeting?
Global Citizens Organizers claim that since 2011, they have raised more than $19 million in their contributions to achieve a range of different goals.
These actions are expected to help world leaders achieve their goals and objectives worth more than $37 billion, which would affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had completed 390 of its stated goals and new shares, for which it has already paid or accumulated a total of $10 billion.
Groups estimate that the collected heart rate has so far directly affected over 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key events include the Power of Food, a partnership of investors and executives set up in the UK to help children grow up in full-fledged society, which has all agreed to give Rwanda $35 million to help the UK's children grow up in this area. The first four weeks of the year have received 4,700 grants from the World Bank.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world as well as yours, the company's failure to deliver a live performance in historical journalism was announced by Ambassador General Treysey Ulmann in a press release in London in April 2018.
The group has also announced that it has completed more than 5,000 actions called for by the United Kingdom to increase the welfare of mothers and babies, the government has recently funded a new Power Nutrition Project which will intervene in the goal of increasing nutrition by 5 million days and more.
Of the hundred questions asked of all mankind, which voice of God's mind can he give to the most extreme of the wicked?
The global citizen says: "It will be a long and difficult road for her to go, and there will be both failure and ruin.
But even though they had been chosen before us by a great multitude of men and had succeeded in opposing the aristocracy, they succeeded and made my plans even more successful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B and Janelle Moon are some of the performers who are entering this year's New York City show, whose homecoming will be Deborah-Lee Ferns and Hugh Jackman.
The SAD could give the Navy a demand for blocking Russian energy exports, says Interior Minister
Washington may need to take a stand on its own Navy to help Russian energy reach foreign markets, including the Middle East, Interior Minister S.A.D. Ryan Zinke, now a Washington diplomat, revealed.
Zinc was also aware of Russia's involvement in Syria where, in particular, it was interested in the legitimate power of the masks to explore new energy markets.
"Then the reason for their presence in the Near East was to be the desire to produce the best of all the energies, as they did in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe", he said.
But first to this man, there is a great pride and a great heart, which can make all things stand.
"The present Government has the power, with the help of our Navy, to prevent the opening of sea lanes and, if necessary, to block them, as we could ensure their integrity without reaching the markets", he said.
Zinc has also invited attendees to attend the Saudi Energy Agency, a nonprofit group which is self-proclaimed as the global energy agency of the SAD.
He further suggested Washington's approach to the Russian and Iranian front, arguing that they were essentially the same.
The economic opponents of Iran and Russia were, more or less, cooperative and energy-efficient, he said, saying to Russia that the country would be destroyed by the same trick and the land would be destroyed by the same device which would depend on fossil fuels.
These statements were made at a time when the Trump administration was trying to force the export of all of its real natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which was by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
In pursuit of this goal, officials from the Trump administration, including former SAD President Donald Trump, attempted to persuade Germany not to allow the planned project to build the North Tower 2, which, before Trump, was carried out by Berlin to Moscow.
The upper reaches of the Nagasaki River are northern Tokugawa 2, a $11 billion river that needs to double the capacity of the present river to 110 billion cubic meters, a pure economic product.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to this project was prompted by economic downturn and a precipitous wave of unfair competition.
"I believe that the part of the vision that energy can be used as a central pressure relief and that consumers need to have the ability to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in a meeting with the Minister of Energy of the SADR, Rick Perry, in Moscow.
The SAD has expressed a negative reaction to Germany, which has confirmed its credibility with this project.
The head of the German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the SAD not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral dispute between Berlin and Moscow.
"We are concerned about the mixing of third countries in our energy supply", said Dietter Kemf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), in recognition of the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will have to think about her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, says a senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would consider running for president without a vote in the majority of the vote.
At the meeting of the city administration in Hollock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would reject the candidacy.
It's time for a woman to go to Washington and the heart of our dysfunctional government, including the woman at the top, she said, as Hill's page says.
On November 6, I will have to think about my candidacy for president.
The war was so successful that the Civil Service criticized President Donald Trump, saying he would bring the earth into a state of emergency.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren's case was opened by Trump's criticism of his Supreme Court candidacy, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "We're in need of an FBI investigation before we can be heard".
Meanwhile, the announcement of the fourth quarter announcement is still in its official voting range, with the mayor's office not expected to be ready for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight of the very first Massachusetts voters said the Senate would not need to vote, first by an unsuccessful vote of the University of Massachusetts Political Science Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
Annette has voiced support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for the presidential candidacy and 48 percent support for the opposition.
Other notable names from the Democratic Party who were mentioned in connection with the 2020 presidential candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said that the foreign court will be in session by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder of the Palin Traffic at a meeting of Donald Trump
Trac Peylin, 26, began a year of fighting in Iraq before joining the army in September.
On Monday, a complaint was filed about the incident involving childbirth
"This cross my son passes, this cross he passes a long way, I can understand another piece of code that is the responsibility of the PTSD and some of the wounds we suffered with our soldiers, "the speech was made to the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pelin's introduction describes a great problem in which all are ignorant and complaining about their sons and other war veterans: "I am always going to turn to one another, to turn to the other, to drink to the other, to drink to the other, to have respect for their fellow soldiers and other war veterans and all the other soldiers who are always going to fight".
He was brought to justice in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, sexual assault, and weapons-handled assault, including the death of Dan Bennett, a police officer in Wasilla.
18 federal states and the District of Columbia upheld the preliminary examinations of new asylum applications
Eight federal states and the District of Columbia upheld the initial pre-trial of the new SAD order that precludes asylum-seeking victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
The presidents of 18 states and the District of Columbia delivered Friday to Washington, D.C., submissions via friends of the court to express support for the asylum-seeker who wanted to challenge the report, NBC News reported.
They have a full range of claims in the Grace v. Court, a case against which the American Civil Liberties Union has denied a civil suit.
She complained that her partner and her sons, gang members, had become angry, or that her officials from the SAD on June 20 had refused the shelter for asylum.
She's being held in Texas.
The conservative lawyers who provided legal support to the Graces described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, lands from which the vast majority of asylum seekers in the SAD came, as the Nazis faced a broad range of problems with violence and trafficking.
The new SAD's asylum application was submitted in 2014 by the Office for Immigration Affairs, and undocumented migrants fleeing violence in the process of being granted asylum.
The District of Columbia's top defense attorney, Carl Reisin, issued a new description of the decade's state, federal, and international law on Friday.
The common law of the land gives all judgments concerning all the rights of asylum to be brought against the inherent rights and freedoms of those brought into the land, and such a dispute violates this principle, even in the presence of the enemy of the court.
The lawyers further in the document gave a description of how immigrants will revive the USDA's defense mechanisms, saying they would look to become more advanced and provide more needed labor force.
Chief Justice Jeff Sessions appealed in June to immigration judges to no longer approve asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who have abandoned their maternal land because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political status, Sessions said in an interview with the New York Times on June 11.
Asylum was never the solution to all the problems - even the most serious - that all people face in the wider world.
The last of these is the attempt to save Paul, and the number of the dead has doubled until the race for the victory of the lost is over.
The survivors were in the face of the worst of all.
It was a busy time, says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her young son who cried fever at an evacuation center in the desert city of Palau.
He's got a shot every minute of the day.
He has not yet given clean water.
The builders were seen as returning to their destroyed homes, choosing to destroy their creatures and trying to save everything possible.
Hundreds of people were affected, and the sickness caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake was felt.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who suffered spinal and shoulder injuries, lay in front of the outpatient hospital in Palau, where patients were treated for unresolved snow injuries.
His eyes were filled with tears as he felt until an earthquake violently rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
It was not the time to save.
I think I was pressed by the rubble of the wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for the wedding.
He heard his wife's voice, and she kept quiet.
I don't know what was going on with her and my child.
I hope all goes well.
The Saudi ambassador has accused China of misconduct in propaganda
Unfortunately, despite the fact that the foreign film paper announced a four-page ad in a single journal from the SAAD, highlighting the opposite trade users between the SAAD and China, the SAAD ambassador to China issued a warning to Beijing of the US's wide-ranging trade embargo.
SAD President Donald Trump mentioned the failure of the Central Committee to include the Cheyenne Dairy List in the Demony Register - the most uncommon list in Iowa State - in the contested decision of the Senate to try the meat in the November 6 election to Congress, which is the Senate's response.
The Trump rumours that Beijing was trying to interfere in the election in the SAD have been announced even though SAD officials described Reuters as a new phase in the Washington campaign at the height of all the strong pressure on China.
While it was normal for foreign governments to announce a commercial announcement, Beijing and Washington were turned into an escalating trade war in the wake of the new round of black imports.
The purpose of the Kine's retaliatory cuts in the early phase of the trade war was to appease exporters from the state along the Aegean route, which supported Trump's Republican stance, said experts from Saudi Arabia and Kine.
Terry Branstad, the SAA ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Oyo State, a major exporter of semi-natural products to China, said Beijing would honor American workers, farmers and companies.
As Brunsett wrote in a column in the unpublished edition of the Demon Register, Kinnow now additionally publishes propaganda stories in our own low-budget press.
In the broadest sense of the word, the Cinematic Universe uses the ancient American tradition of the slalom of the governor and the slalom of the stamps, announcing the royal proclamation in the Demoignon Registry, the Brunswick inscription.
On the other hand, at a newsstand on a Beijing street, the girls heard little of the conflicting voices and could not see any of the first lines of thought of the contrary, which the Chinese government had been trying to overthrow, while the media were firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party.
It seemed that some of the unknown film footage had withdrawn an offer to announce its membership, or no idea which list it was.
Analysts warn all Republicans to leave the women's suffrage field before choosing half of the mandate, due to debate with Judge Kavanaugh.
As many of the top Republican backers and defense candidates for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's appeal to the Supreme Court over the sexual assault case, analysts have speculated that the case will have negative reaction, specifically to the criminal charges, and a preliminary selection of half of the defendants.
The emotions surrounding this situation are exaggerated, and the true republic is still known to want to give it its full voice.
Such a thing is impossible to say, said Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University in a paper published in the Hilltop List on Saturday.
Richer expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona would insist on the FBI's last-minute threat of being forced to kill the injured voice.
Women don't talk about it until tomorrow - not tomorrow, not in November - is the fifth word spoken by Karen Jean-Pierre, senior counsel and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, as the Washington DC paper reports.
The Democrats called for a "Stay November" on Friday morning! When they protested in the Senate chamber, however, Republicans, who control the Supreme Court, decided to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, as Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, a former witness, reported, said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will lead to unprecedented results", said the news agency St. Rothenberg, a non-partisan political activist.
People say that this is true even in their own homes.
Or it can grow and grow, spanning between the vague female vocal cords from the forehead and the younger vocal cords, from 18 to 29 years old, which often do not sound, for example, even in the presence of the president.
Even before the public testimony in which Ford detailed his sexual assault complaint about his long-standing candidacy for Supreme Court justice, analysts were convinced that he would be able to give a positive response to Republicans' support of his candidacy.
This was reflected in a major scandal for the Republican Party, a recent NBC news report by Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
"Not only about the vote of the House or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will finish the trial, but also about the reason all Republicans heard about it and how they all got it, the same thing happened to the news channel that Guy Cecil, the director of the U.S. Prime Minister's Group, was elected to the Democratic nomination.
Meanwhile, it seems that the Americans have been thoroughly successful in asking what kind of witnesses the Ford and Kavanaugh witnesses are, with little more than those who are next.
The new enquiry, which was led by the South's Agency, shows that 41 percent of the respondents have definite or false beliefs about the Ford witnesses, while 35 percent say that he has a definite or false belief in the Cavanno witnesses.
In addition, 38 percent of them spoke of the future as being the Cavan's real or definitive legacy in all its forms, yet 30 percent of them thought the same of Ford.
At Fleck's insistence, the FBI is continuing to investigate the suspected murder of Ford, the co-defendant and the youngest person ever convicted, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford was unable to testify before the Supreme Court before the Senate because he was drinking alcohol in a barrel when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidacy for a Supreme Court member showed her all the genius of the time-fighting party she attended during a study on the Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web has been a threat to the creation of a new Internet that would rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup project whose goal is to make the world a rival to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is the first company built on the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
A solid user base enables them to know where all their information is stored and to be able to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee asked us to give a number of clues about the global dominance of the Inrupt project.
"I'm not going to be here today, he's going to start a startup.
This is a historical turnaround.
The application uses Solid technology to enable humans to create their own personal space for offline storage of data, or PDO.
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional items.
This is how Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in the same browser.
This is a unique personal space for online storage of information that is excluded from the user's dependence on which information can be accessed.
The company called it a personal enhanced cross-platform.
The idea for Inrupt, as CEO John Bruce says, is to give the company resources, processes, and value to make the help of Solid accessible to all.
The company is made up of a rotating pool of Berners-Lee, Bruce, free platforms purchased from the A-B-E, unlike the old programs involved in the project and the newly developed code.
Starting from this week, the wider world has been able to create a decentralized application with the help of tools available to the Incruptcy community.
Berners-Lee says he and his team have been discussing with Facebook and Google whether to introduce a full-scale campaign that will see all of their famous models face off with their twisted heads.
He did not demand permission from them.
In a statement on Saturday on the platform Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Incruptcy's mission is to provide commercial energy and a certain ecosystem that will help preserve the integrity and quality of the new hatred built on the Solidarity movement.
Berners-Lee's 1994 Internet transaction was the first of its kind when the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology founded the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the most influential voices in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Along with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Institute for Open Data.
"I was very optimistic about this new era of hatred", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a World War I conscientious objector, the wearer of the Victoria Cross
One of the Church of England's most famous icons is the Victorian cross of a World War I-era soldier, which has been restored to its original state 100 years later.
Colonel Colonel Bernard Van served in this capacity on 29 September 1918, the same year as the attacks on Bellangelis and Leocore.
Meanwhile, four days later, a sniper killed the gunman and never realized he had captured Britain's newest war department.
His two granddaughters on Saturday uncovered a landmark such as a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of her grandchildren, Michael Vaughn, said that the emblem was a symbol that the plate was uncovered about 100 years after her grandfather's death.
Before the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van had completed his battle across the St. Quentin Canal in thick fog, under heavy artillery and lightning.
He then hurried to the back line and with a strong junta led the attack before he could land an artillery gun and knock out three members of the crew.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a few days before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's footsteps were the only thing I knew I would never be able to follow, or anything as outstanding as his.
He and his brother Dr. James Van also travelled outside the palace to be led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that the whole of the world was about to be transformed into a paradise and that the first king's reign would be demonstrated by the support of many people.
MMA fighters stayed awake for the night to watch the Bell 206, and instead beat Peppa Pig

The San Jose landings included 13 battles, including six in the main action, and the UK was assigned to Channel 5 on the night.
At 6am, the same time that Gerard Mussey and Rory McDonald were walking out of the house, the UK viewers were shocked when the news was delivered to Peppa Pig.
Some were very angry, but they stayed up until the early morning to fight.
One of the children's pre-kindergarten tweets described a kind of sick shoe.
"Before the order was made, the 6 a.m. support would be in place, so they would have to pay for the child's services", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Belarus, who has since raised questions about the transfer.
'Peace of the Pig,' Mrs.
The company's president, Bill Scott Cocker, has said that he will work on his entire industry scheme to include future UK viewers.
"I think that whatever the prize is, I think I'll be able to do it", said Cocker.
It was the sixth day of the week, and nothing was going to happen until the end of the week, the end of the week.
Or working on it.
I believe that when this was done, there were many tricks and not all were friendly.
They tried to make it look like a mess, thinking it was a matter of technical waste.
If not, the problem would be with the state.
I can promise you I will give you this one tenth time.
I kept this in the fifth battle instead of the sixth as usual and tried to give me more than I could give to the usual and the unusual.
The question is a serious one.
Desert Island: Tom Daley has experienced an inferiority in his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority in relation to each other because of his sexuality  or that it gave him a motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old tells us that up until the high school graduation, we were all happy to see them.
In a radio interview on Radio 4 in the first issue of the Desert Island Disc show with host Lauren Laverne, he said he would talk about gay rights as he would give others a chance.
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics since he became a native.
The long-running series' lead author, Kirsty Young, was unlike any human present at the time of the show.
Refraining from the impression of the person mentioned in Laverne's first broadcast, Daley said that he felt less valuable than the rest until he was raised to be socially acceptable to all boys and girls.
And he said, "Until the present time, I have given my own little ones and my own people, who were my own creatures, and who have given me power and strength to do good".
He wanted to prove that he was a man and nothing, he said, so as not to waste everything on his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known fighter for LGBT rights and made his debut at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to a higher level of criminalization of homosexuality.
It is said that when he died, he felt heartfelt that he could live again, without a trace and that he wanted to give to others.
The three-time world champion is currently working on a new series of men's boxing novels, directed by Dustin Lens Blake, who took over in 2013.
Daily's last year ended with a 20-year-old Oscar, or he's saying that the year will never be the last of his problems.
When he first crossed the line at such an early age at the first Olympics he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, saying he was too young to follow someone of the same age who had achieved similar successes and failures.
Their two became parents in June, Robert Ray's sons were buried by Black-Daily, and Daily says he gave him a very bright perspective.
If I were asked about the past year, it would be 'I must give my own gold medal,' he said.
Or the more important things from the Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
Her son shares the same name as her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that her father accepted that she would die and that none of her last questions were whether she would ever get a card for the 2012 London Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to live to be in the first place,'" he said.
And he took the whole thing by the hand, and breathed it, and breathed it, and died; and the whole thing was not satisfied, he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"Everyone knew that the thing that I had been dreaming about all my life was going to be the grey front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games, there never was a better feeling", he said.
This feeling inspired her to choose the first song, "Proud Header Small", which she co-wrote with him in preparation for the Olympics and for the next few years.
The Desert Island show is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15pm British time.
Michaelson's about to fall from a stage at a club for Saturday night's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson set a record in the week when he played his 47th game for the Raiders, or a player who would have missed the opportunity to pitch a no-hitter.
Michaelson, who is participating in this two-year event for the 12th time this past Wednesday, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk to the club for Saturday's game with four laptops and a game of non-stop action.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as often as it is in the United Kingdom, the five-time champion will be tasked with leading the game as a hunter and working his way through the game and the field in hopes of accomplishing the same task as his torment.
Since at the peak of her career she would be the most accurate in a long-distance run, this 48-year-old was her ideal candidate for the narrow-field golf national, where the long-standing high-school business grew.
And as the third half of her final outing, Mickelson entered the ninth inning of the match against British champion Frank Moulinary, who joined his newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in all four of those matches.
Like the Americans, who had a four-pointed sword with 12 daily edges, Michaelson's sword would have been an excellent choice.
Furyk was willing to give them authority over all the people, even though he could not do the same for many others.
"In the end, he understood the reason for which he had this day, he took me by the hand, he embraced me and told me that he would be ready for tomorrow", said Furyk.
I have a lot of things to do.
His name was in the Hall of Fame, and he has served this team so well in the past, even in this situation.
The real deal was to plan for that two-ball game.
He planned all the above, but it was a failure and that was the path he had to take.
He wanted to be like the dark, just as he was like the others.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most unsuccessful swords ever drawn in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the culmination of a career at Ryder's bunch of people who never reached the height of his personal record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk says he's really made the team.
He was a cheerful, sarcastic, spirited, and very shy of people and was a great man in the team space, he explained.
I thought younger players used it in the game, and this was a bad idea, even though it was a bad idea.
He provides much more than the game itself.
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that great leadership can be given to the unknown
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that the last day of the regular sword is coming to an end.
Danz made his debut in 1997 in the Battle of the Waldera, where he survived the battle of the Seven Ballasters, who won the lead from fifth point to the Americans, or the entire length of the battle, by winning the 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Staying with the prospect of a big lead for the Walders; having a big lead for Brooklyn, where they lost, and the Walders, where they won, it was so bad, Cage Bjorn (pictured) was still looking to win the 2018 class of 5-3 on Friday and Thursday with a 10-6 overall record in the NFL's last three seasons.
Dacelle, history will tell me and everyone in this team to the end.
The next morning, I came in full force.
I will bring out the darkness and will gather all that is in need.
Nothing that has cooked up will ever touch us.
I have a goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that will remain the focus.
As we speak, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our lineup, or how they can be aware of the position of the opposing lineup of the world's greatest players.
Enthusiastic about the game of golf on the hard court, Björn added: "I would never run ahead of the miners for anything.
The next day, something else happened.
The individual player comes to the game tomorrow, and so he builds up another's game.
It is good to be a partner with all the creatures in the field, or to be a partner with all the creatures in the field, and your golfing ability will be tested.
It is a ship to which the toy must be transferred, the morning sun being pulled out.
From now on all the things that are in the heavens will be cut off, and the same way the sea itself will cut off and give away all things from the heavens".
With the exception of Björn, team captain Jim Furyk has been more than a day's work from the players he has announced to his partners, with the exception of Jordan Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who have taken three out of four boats.
And Furyk himself was on the verge of these great breakthroughs in the last days, first as the winning team to Brooklyn, and then as the loser when the European team performed the Miracle in the Middle.
"I remember every word of it", he said, "and I was wondering how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 squad, raised the bar with his games until they were all over for the next day".
"Tomorrow he has 12 heavy swords, or it would be better to have a quick start on the way that he saw in Brooklyn and that he saw in Medina.
When the sound of that sound is in the one hand, the pressure is on the heart sword.
I have first made my way and have now done as I thought I should, and have known, and tried to make the first little magic of tomorrow.
He then took a turn to try to lead the opposition and face Rory MacIlroy in the final, alongside Paul Casey, Jack Rose, John Rama, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the rest of the European side in the top half.
Turning himself with this group of men into that sea of the sea, I think, as he covered the whole world to the end, he proceeded to destroy Björn's whole selection of the sword of the day.
New delay for a new German tugboat
The newest German frigate, the Morangarice, had to enter service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era battleship, or not reach the mainland until the next few years due to the fallible systems and the nasolabial tendons, local media have gathered.
The wreck of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, is now due to be completed in the first half of 2019, ahead of the Cajt list which has been transferred to the Navy.
It was a long time before he joined the Mourneries in 2014, but the problems of the competition have confirmed the future of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the original Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected that a powerful ball, a series of anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, and a stealth of technology, along the path of the mobile radar, infrared and acoustic field, will be used.
Other important features include a long period of uninterrupted work needed to be able to deliver the most advanced freight forward to two years of float from the main bow.
Meanwhile, longstanding concerns are that these most advanced warships that Germany has been able to project all its power to the sea will be ready for service at the moment, according to Cajt.
The F125's ill-fated frigate arrived in the nineteenth century when a German naval officer called for a flotilla and sent it back to the shipyards of Bloom and Foss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that a Mournaraic had ever returned to the shipyard without a shipwreck.
Little is known about the return of the cruiser, but the German media have offered higher circular effects on software and hardware that would render such a cruise ship useless as a launching pad for a combat mission.
Software failures were extremely important, as the floating Baden-Württemberg class would have been the first to sail from about 120 nautical miles to half the human race since the older Bremen class frigates.
He also proved that the weight of the ship was drastically reduced, which would weaken its performance and limit the ability of the Mourneries to move forward.
The Rhineland-Palatinate was today weighed 7,000 tons of heavy cruise ships of the same class that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the failed hardware, the cost of the project's reading including the training of the subject is also a problem to solve.
The net income is said to be EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problem with the latest frigate is the uncertainty of coming to terms with the lack of warnings about the removal of the German naval force.
Earlier that year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the defence department in the German parliament, confirmed that the Mourneries had begun to supply the ships with personnel for service.
This bell has been the same for the problem of growing all the more serious and serious, as the ships were being rebuilt without the introduction of modern floats.
He expressed his regret for this day despite the failure of the Baden-Württemberg class to join the Moornarics.
The National Endowment for the Arts listens to the secret life of the blind mouse
A newly explored cattle breed is being built on a single estate in Scottish Highlands to reveal the blindness of mice using geographic features in the food industry.
Seekers are hoping to shed new light on the progress of these united flightless sisters and to help guide future activities toward their well-being.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland's Common and Pathogenic Blind Muscles, Cao and Measles have conducted a long-term research and water research at the Inverness Gardens in the West Roses region.
Special instructions for recording will be provided at key locations across a wide range of fields to increase the activity of the blind mice this season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) will also conduct mobile manual detection tests.
A thorough sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the sound of the blind mice and what kind of work they do.
A detailed map of the area will then be presented, showing how the entire picture of their journey would be taken in the same direction.
Rob Djur, a consultant for the Foundation's environmental studies, hopes that the results will reveal which other animals are more harmful to the blind mice and which are more likely to harm them.
This information will help to assess the sustainability of the natural habitat in the way of wildlife, and how the best forestry can be done for the benefit of blind mice and other threatened species.
The number of blind mice in Scotland and the wider UK has been declining in recent times.
They are faced with construction and warfare work that affects the destruction and destruction of their homes.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a significant risk, as do sticky tracks from flies and some types of chemical treatments of building materials and domestic flies.
Blind mice in the wild are not blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunter-gatherers, their ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
The invention of sophisticated eco-location technology would have affected the way insects and birds travel in the summer.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 buildings from the historic mansion, 38 important farmhouses and 76,000 acres of land, has been extensively involved in the blindness of the target.
The foundation has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct searches, investigations, and rescue operations.
This organisation was responsible for the creation of the first and only Norman blind-targeted reserve in Scotland, the Trive estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of blind targets in Scotland.
The name's inventor, David Thompson, says that this was the name of the original territory.
Once in Triva, they have a distinctive area for blind mice, they say.
It has old buildings, old timber, and a good stability in the whole.
Or much more of this talk of the blind mice is more unknown to us forever, for we will be doing this and other things to help them to have a better understanding of what they need to do to advance".
That lasting importance of first-hand presence of the blind mice before the work is done and the maintenance in the lock-up, the event of the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young females and the male population from the eradication of the local population.
Blind mice are protected and resisted by killing, torturing, or disturbing and destroying their nests.
Elizabeth Fairle, a Scottish spokeswoman for the Foundation for the Protection of the Blind, encourages the public to include and contribute.
"Many more need to be taught about our blind minds, " he replied", for many of our kind do not know what kind of people we are".
Ronald rejected the rape charge, defending the defendant's claim against the defendant's report
Christian Ronaldo described the challenge of the power of the Bible to counter false news, saying that people should use it to promote themselves.
His lawyer's appeal to the court was to the German newspaper Spiegel, which had announced the charges.
The attacker from Juventus and Portugal was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Major in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
She was later paid $375,000 for not agreeing to the incident, Spiegel announced Friday.
By turning 142 million of his friends' Instagram accounts into false views against the allegations of the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, responded to the report to the fake news.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
That's what they said today, false news, the Golden Fleece's five-time winner said in the chamber.
They want to promote themselves by using their own resources.
That's the norm.
I want to give them glory so that they may speak my name, or else they may be slain.
I'm a hearty man and everything is fine, the football player came with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers have been preparing a case against Spiegel for the court, which has described the report as unacceptable for the public, Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Scherz has ruled that the footballer will seek an unsuccessful death shield in a move that will reduce the burden of the offense, which has been a significant blow to the team since the most unsolved personal injury cases in recent years.
The incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub stay, Ronaldo and Major returned to the game room, where he was forced to play, before the current Circuit Court in Clark County, Nevada, announced.
The Major claims that Ronald has been following a recent incident in the kneecap by claiming that he was either 99 years old or had left his teeth unturned.
The documentary asserts whether Ronaldo confirmed whether the couple had sex or whether it was a good basis.
The Major claims that she had taken to the police with the photographs of all her injuries committed in hospital, or that if she had suddenly accepted the vengeance of the court, she had felt a deep fear of being taken away and worried about being taken to the hospital.
The 34-year-old says that she now wants to help the poor and suffer from the recent incident.
Ronald was on the brink of a recent attack on Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he spent €100 million on Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK would never overcome the loss of a car manufacturer
The UK would never regret that the Brexit crisis had caused it to lose its status as a world leader in automotive production, said Finance Minister Greg Clark.
It came as a surprise that Toyota UK had informed the BBC that the incident would result in Britain leaving the EU without a dispute, which prompted a delay in production at Barnstone near Derby.
"The need for us is a challenge", said Clark.
A Japanese automobile manufacturer has agreed to make the Brexit border clear without causing a loss of jobs.
The Barnstone factory that produces today's Auris and Avensis has produced nearly 150,000 automobiles a year, of which 90% have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My vision is to have a big impact in a factory like Britain's on the market coming out of the EU", says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota's Barnstone factory.
Other UK automotive manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without a dispute over the functioning of cross-border trade.
B-M-W, for example, says that the Brexit man will be able to build his own black mining factory in Oxford.
The main reason for concern is the overall risk of the chain of events leading to the uncertain Brexit, say carmakers.
The Toyota production line operates on a time-based basis, with parts of the ordered cars arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU manufacturers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a dispute on 29 March, it could come to the forefront of what industry leaders say would lead to a downturn in cash and inadequate employment.
Toyotha could not have assembled an inventory for more than a single day at her factory in Derbyshire, the company was in a state of disrepair, so the output would be real.
Clark says that the plan of Theresa May of the Chequers in connection with the future merger with the EU will be precisely calibrated to allow the first such outbreak to occur at the border.
"We need a debate, and I want a debate that will enrich us, as I would say, not just a momentary success, not a chance to win, but a chance to win", he told BBC Radio 4.
"The witnesses not only from Toyot, himself and other producers, say that the ultimate must be in the ability to deliver that very thing to the knowledge of a successful set of supply chains".
Toyotaka's moulds could tell us how much work a large production would do, or the threat of a longer hand of manufacturing would remove the competitiveness of the fabric and cutting us down to the point of losing the original seats.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has been working at Barnstone for 24 years and who is the union official at the Junite factory, says that his members will take better care of everything: "In my experience, once all this work is done, no more will be done.
The government's portfolios said: "We have come up with a precise and compelling plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's ownership of the Roseanne Nation can be extended again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's important relationship with his former state supreme court counsel, Rod Rod Rod Rodgers, could be tied to a right-wing political dispute until the fight against the Supreme Court's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, was over from the White House in the middle.
Rosenstyn oversees the work of special counsel Robert Maller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, the conflict between Trump's aides and Russia and the possible resignation of the longtime president.
The question is whether or not Trump will change the top defense attorney and try to end Mallory's independence, although the meat is the focus of the Washington press.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was wearing a headset to record Trump's speech and the possibility of removing the president by way of the 25th Amendment.
The first was the "Roseenstein" speech.
But the wicked one went to the White House, looking for a way to give back.
Instead, he was joined by Trump, who was then in the United Nazis in New York, and was excited about the fourth quarter.
Trump said that the Senate would not change the position of Rozenstine, but that he would have a more serious case to avoid the appeal of the Senate Supreme Court hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women on the plane were accused of having sex with the sex offender, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
Trump filed a one-day FBI investigation into the Cavanno award complaint on Friday, further delaying the entire Senate's vote.
Trump's former chief of staff, Sarah Sanders, has been making a comeback on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein, she replied: "As long as I have a certain date, I could have this misfortune, and I could have been guilty of it, in view of all the other things that I have done in the Supreme Court.
But I see, and I will never stop giving thanks for the good news.
Some reporters could challenge this claim: Sanders has held a White House stunt on Sept. 10.
The captain, Chris Wallace, was drinking from the bar.
Sanders's rhetoric was to give the continuity of her successor's first successor's desire to give the first song a song, or to say: "I would not refuse to hear the whole song until I have the right to give the first song a song".
It was then announced that a direct contact between Trump and the innovator would be established.
The president of their higher conference in which he had been asked about the question of who was the other president before him, said without hesitation: "They have done this before".
And there will be further questions, Sanders said, or how the novices have the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, which has not been more interesting than the reasoning with me.
I have tried to do this often and have seen the way in which many of the ways I have done this have been so wrong and I will do so instead of stopping to step down when I have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States.
Trump regularly responds to questions by appealing to delegates from the White House or when he participates in open meetings or news conferences with guest speakers.
The actual conflicts with the stamps are rare.
The president of New York has also spoken of this week's event, which will be a complete and unusual one for the entire newsroom.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff at the Scottish National Health Service following the Brexit patience
The Minister of Health wrote to a member of the EU working for the National Health Service of Scotland to express their gratitude for their land and to encourage them to stay and help with Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament's Jean Freeman envoy wrote in a letter to the press about the UK's departure from the EU six months ago.
The Scottish Government has already announced that it will cover the costs of the European Union's citizens' compensation for their work in its public service.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "The UK's exit from the EU negotiations have been going on all summer, heading for the expected result in June.
But the UK government is also working on a plan to make the scenario possible without further dispute.
I know that these distressing times are sure to come for you.
For now I desire to give again the price of every member of the body, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from various parts of the EU, both old and new, have brought us a wealth of experience and expertise to train and advance the work of the public service, the patient and the community in which he served.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and you know you'd like to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie was suddenly struck by a gunshot wound to the head
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie was immediately hit by an opponent's knockout after suffering a head-on injury in Saturday's game with a 31-27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores, who had captured Mack Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed has said that the first head coach will arrive before the halftime.
"He came to the outer line and there he collapsed", said Reed.
Trainees and medical personnel put Abercrombie in the car before they could put him in harm's way and delay further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was transferred to Vanderbilt Medical Center to be treated.
Harris went on to give more details about the type/size of evidence and to give Tennessee State a chance to discover where it came from.
Abercrombie, the redwood tree of the past year, was torn down in the first season of Tennessee's statewide non-transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five opponents before he dropped out of the game, with a season-high 18 points.
The fear of customers is paying off the exports of tax stamps by comparing the purchase of non-cash in the UK
The price of tax stamps is expected to increase with the purchase of UK real estate, and future revenue will be used to help in-box inexperienced people with new plans for taxation.
This trip will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voices
The official export of taxable marks applies to those who do not pay taxes in UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million for help to the inexperienced next year
With the fear of customers paying for the exports of tax stamps, the likelihood of purchases of UK real estate and future revenue from the sale of these to help inexperienced people, Theresa May will be astonished today.
This path is a continuation of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to neutralize the success of the newly formed group of young voices by promising to give them access to more established space and a third-party platform to advance them to the top.
The effective use of the tax mark will apply to the physical and legal persons who do not pay the tax in the UK, and future research will use it to further the Government's fight against inexperience.
The previous opponents who were to come to the tax mark, including the previously introduced exports of two years' worth of second homes and the purchase of the uncertainties of the issuance, would have been able to give exports up to three decades.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million by the end of the year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new homes in London are purchased by non-resident UK, despite the rising prices and demands of people who buy a first home coming from a costly space.
Many of the richest parts of the earth and the narrowest of corners have become city dwellings because of the great number of ancient merchants who have been living in the land for a long time.
The new order is a rare failure, even though Boris Johnson called for removing the tax mark to help young people get to their first home.
He challenged the large construction firms to keep the high prices of the land unfair even if it was of no use and appealed to Prime Minister May to dispute the right of access to the home as it would have caused the British Empire to lose its valuable territory.
Corbyn introduced a remarkable array of pre-existing reforms, including the exploitation control and the unprecedented exploitation of the slave trade.
They also want to give us the authority to build new homes.
My Prime Minister has said: "In the next seven years I will declare my Prime Minister's mandate to celebrate the restoration of the British dream so that the life of every new generation will be better".
And that's the reason and the solution to our price-fixing market.
Britain will always be open to the people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be exhausted until the purchase of a non-cash stock is made available to non-UK nationals and to long-term companies such as the UK Government.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become a dream, until the reality of the lowly inexperienced has become a dream.
Jack Ross: "My ambition is to lead Scotland".
Sanderland's chief executive Jack Ross says his ambition is to be Scotland's next-door manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott was involved in the revival of the Northern club who were knocked out of the top three in the First Division, three points clear of the top.
This summer he transferred to St Mirren Stadium for the first time since returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
He was on the B-Team of the Presidents and that's it, Ross told the BBC's SportsSound broadcast.
But he grew up watching Scotland and Hampden with his father until he was a child, and it was no use ever returning.
However, such an opportunity would provide the only way to succeed in running a club.
His early predecessors to the Sanderlands manager included Dick Advocate, David Moise, Sam Alldays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paul Di Caney.
The former head of Aloha Athletics says he was patient with the fact that even though he played for such a big name at such a big club, he was also backed by offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Mirillo succeeded in this training will be in the question 'Will I succeed in getting this club back to the Premier League?'
The structure and strength of this club, this undoubtedly Premier League side, was a matter of debate.
"It's not easy to get back to the club, but I think I'll be able to get back to the club where it belongs".
Ross is in the third year of his managerial career, despite a period in which he first served as assistant manager at Dumbarton and then spent 15 months as head coach of Hart's staff.
He then helped Alloa to the third division championship, and St Mirren to the bottom league championship last season.
Ross says that today's feeling of comfort was not the same as when he played for the likes of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
He believed this was the first resurrection, and he said he would inherit the entire conquest of the Aloa Club.
The whole world believed that management was the first thing for me, no longer a game.
It sounds strange to say that a bad, solid seed has grown from that and has been used to some solid success.
But the game is going to be tough.
They have many crosses that must be made to give pleasure to the unfortunate.
And I go on to cross that line in terms of stress and pressure, or the management of my own company.
I always wanted to be in charge of this business, and now I am doing this, in order to make my life more pleasant for everyone.

Ellie Doyle will be the athletic director for Scotland's athletics department
Ellie Doyle was chosen to be a member of the Scottish Athletic Council as the non-executive director of that first organisation's general meeting this year.
Doyle was Scotland's most awarded athlete and its president, John Beatty, described this trip as a wonderful opportunity for those who had water sports to benefit from her outstanding experience in the world of the early twentieth century.
They have adopted a large and respected athletic community in Scotland, UK and the wider world and are sure to give Scotland's athletes a great deal of experience from their membership in the sport, says Beatty.
He said: 'I want to be a voice athlete and hope to give my best to give a contribution and help to the Scottish sporting authorities.'

Advertising for a pump for milk in which all the soft drinks are sold with blood has given us an opinion on the Internet
A company that makes exhaust pumps has shared ideas on the Internet by advertising which parts of the ship are sold.
To illustrate the launching result described as the first unusual pump to pump exhaust fuel to the chest, the inventor of the vacuum engineer Elvie announced a humorous rhetoric that shows the slope of the new pump providing the milk to the exhaust fuel.
Four creatures dance in a shell between the sand and the sea with the song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I have seen everything but no one has noticed, and no one has noticed, but their veins, which are my sights".
The refrain is true: "Pump, pump, feed your baby, pump, pump, pump, all of you".
Meanwhile, the announcement made to the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he saw a variety of glacial reactions, so many said it would delay the use of the dairy industry.
The use of blood to recover this product was a bad omen.
And it came to pass that we and the sea were to labor and to give birth, that we might produce milk; and that all their children should be born as the days after the birth, as no man wrote.
The pump for Elvie's exhaustion discernibly costs the chest for the baby (Elvie/Mother)
Another man remarked: "It is clear that he was suffering for both mother and child.
Or, why would you not use a pump for a soft skin to hold your baby?
And he said, "You are talking nonsense".
Others have made a long-standing claim, and one woman has been accused of giving her name to a pornographic woman.
I think the future of genius.
I would give this to you forever.
You'd feel like a ship with all the bombs.
The advertisement was a lot of noise, but the whole thing was like a needle.
This was a brilliant production, no one wrote it down.
Another commentator remarked: "It was a funny saying that the mother of the cow was drinking milk (often in a workplace or in a toilet) and feeling like a 'cow.'
This is not a matter of praise or criticism to the dairy industry.
In the blink of an eye, a group of women discovered that all the flesh was hidden in their breasts with a discrete pump.
The concept of the recall is based on the idea that many soft-skinned cows must be fattened to give a feeling of being a cow.
Meanwhile, Elvie's pump is full of untouchables, no wires or wires, and stays in the chest for the baby, even though the woman gives her milk to the baby, holding her baby, and the jack and the cork come out of the mouth until the milk runs out.
Anna Ballarin, partner and chief creative officer at Mother, is a commentator: "Elvie's pump was such a revolutionary product to earn a bold and productive launch.
Drawing the parallel between female and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges and challenges of female breastfeeding, as well as the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a way that is fun and that women can connect with.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the track for designer Martha Jacobovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children relocated to a temporary camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children held in custody has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration to make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the sponsors were mostly and themselves undocumented illegal immigrants and feared that they would jeopardize their ability to remain in the country if they left and sought a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albanes, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed last week to Congress that the agency had arrested more than a dozen people who had filed for sponsorship of minors without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who were sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion are criminally persecuted foreigners.
So we're still chasing those people, Mr. Albanes said.
According to the shelter's workers, to speed up the prosecution of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Most will use conference video instead of a personal presence to apply for legal status by an immigration judge.
Those found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and reports from the system over the past months.
Advocates say that concern about the problem is raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of child torment can easily be overlooked because of size.
They add that moving children to temporary settlements without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to be excused from friends can cause traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria orders the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the congregation.
Muallem pointed out that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have fled their homelands.
He also said that Damascus will continue to wage its world war until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and global illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of war-torn countries.
On the refugee question, Muallem said that there were satisfactory conditions for them to return and accused certain Western countries of spreading irrational fear of refugees remaining outside the country.
"We have sent an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return", he said.
He makes politics out of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was reached that would end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a vacuum zone in the latest major insurgency in Idlib has led to the creation of opportunities for further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has diverted attention from large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
Mu'alem, however, stressed that the agreement has clear deadlines and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists along with fighters from the Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda, who would be eradicated.
UN envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, will soon coincide with the goal of forming a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to a review of the current constitution's articles and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump could win re-election in 2020 unless, as a large number of liberals are likely to hope, the accusations and scandals end his rule before then.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic final episode of a presidential career in history!
So far, there are no signs of wear and tear among viewers.
Viewership in the strike-shortened term has more than doubled since 2014, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million in prime time, up from 1.7 million as they had four years ago, according to Nielsen, while the MSNBC network's Rachel Meadow Show ranks first on cable television with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time news days.
"It's a scenario where people get caught up in because it's something we don't understand", says Neil Burr, executive producer of the ABC series Breach of Duty, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy screenwriter and author of the book "Just Fun Parts: And a Few Painful Truths About Hollywood Behind the Scenes", has a different theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him why.
Miss Scovel says he replied, "Because it makes me laugh".
Chaos also has a value in entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the intrigues coming from Washington can determine the future of women's right to decide on abortion, whether immigrant families can come together and the state of the global economy.
The program's shutdown is a luxury that only the most reputable viewers can afford.
Yet, it's a bit of an informed citizen's status when you catch yourself for six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward in his book Fear puts information as fact, the $15,000 pilot jacket of Paul Manafort's new leather jacket (compact put on with pride, as the Washington Post called it) and the implications of the devious descriptions that Storm Daniels offered about Trump's anatomy, this one.
As for me, I will never look at Super Maria the same again.
"One part of his behavior that makes it look like a reality show is that he offers us content every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the show "Stars of the Box", about the changing characters and the daily intrigues of acting in Trump's show schedule (fighting the NFL, glorifying Kim Jong-un).
You must not allow yourself to miss an episode or you will fall behind.
When I met with Mr. Flies this week, there were 26 degrees of sunshine in front of his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was locked inside and watching live on MSNBC, and filming CNN.
He could not get off the screen, not while Brett Kavanagh faces the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"I remember at the time, when we were doing all those crazy series, people were saying this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", says Mr. Flace.
I thought they were kidding, but it seems they were right.

Flow of foreign money amid the hectic run for the Presidential election
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a surge in money, thanks to the rebuilding of congressional districts that have resulted in two congressmen battling for the same seat.
This is how recently Connor Lamb, a Pittsburgh suburban Democrat, won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring, fell.
Lamb is in the race with another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which is bracing itself against the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts unconstitutionally framed election results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th was triggered by a competition to finance the campaign between the party's largest funders, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's fame in Pennsylvania came after a close victory in the widely-charted March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won election by 20 points.
Political pundits gave Trump a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, so it withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
Trump held a heartfelt meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners relocated the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic mission representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Department spokeswoman Heather North said earlier this month.
However, the penalties only applied to El Salvador, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The imposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would hardly fall on a Central American state that already has high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar meeting last year that they saw as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and put an end to all questions about the sanctions on El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would address the conference, whose new term is mid-October, indicating the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the hearing, which described three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal matters on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Studying the History
The next inevitable thing will likely be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible miscarriages of justice by Mr. Trump, which is already well documented in public sources.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump's campaign was in tune with Russia over the election attacks.
If Congress were to be taken over, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and possibly to the court of his fellow citizens.
That's a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don't want to say that Trump's defeat is inevitable  as is the defeat of his counterparts in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make decisions that will determine how long the hardships will last.
German officers in 1938 were ready to undertake a coup against Hitler, that the West was able to resist him and repel the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the massacre that followed in the years that followed.
History is turning around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is running the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein was in a bad mood after this paper published that last year he suggested the president secretly retire and commented on his inability to function.
Rosenstein says the Times' statement is inaccurate.
How do we react when the newly launched investigation of Brett Kavanagh in the FBI is neither complete nor fair, or if it receives approval from the Supreme Court, despite reliable accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the snap election that Mr. Trump considers reliable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath at that table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can we avoid being optimistic about our future?

Grey's Dorance of Rangers optimistic about meeting Rapid Vian
Rangers are welcoming Rapid Wien on Thursday, aware that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will bring them a solid position for qualification from the Europa League group stage.
Grimm Doran, a midfielder, was unable to appear in the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, but believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger goals.
"That's a good point for us because Villarreal is in a better position", said the 31-year-old.
We entered the game with the belief that we could get something, and we came out with a point.
We may have been able to get them in the end, but in all things, the same result is quite fair.
They were probably better than us in the first half, but we went back in the second half and took it.
Thursday is approaching and it will be another big night for Europe.
We hope we can score three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a great result from the last game.
The past year has been quite difficult, with all the injuries and changes that have happened to me at the club itself, but the current position is satisfying.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now hold on, leave the past season behind, and make it work.
Women Overwhelmed by Pension Savings
Despite the fact that the respondents clearly knew what kind of care they wanted, very few of them discussed it with families.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide study said they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them say they have discussed it with their children.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Group.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring unless you give them a proper advance notice of your wishes.
You and your family can decide where and how you want to receive care, as these are choices that have a cost impact.
Include a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those expenses.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include regular long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that includes money and cost-effectiveness, or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documentation: Warn of legal disputes.
Get a health care assistant so that you have a trusted person to whom you can trust to take care of your medical needs and to ensure that health care workers are aware of your wishes in case you are unable to speak for yourself.
Also, consider giving authority to manage finances.
You should choose a reliable financial decision-maker for you and ensure that bills are paid on time if you are unable to do so.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details so that you can be prepared
"It's not just about money, but about questions like who are doctors?" asks Martin.
What medicines does he use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan in place for all of this.
Male shot multiple times by aerial gun in Ilfracom
The male was shot several times by an air rifle as he returned home from the exit.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Ilfracom section of Devon called Oxford Grove when he was shot in the chest, stomach and cheek.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 p.m. British Summer Time, as a "natural act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have asked witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, according to official sources.
Because of disconnected contacts, emergency officials could not get information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palau that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palau after the disaster.
Here are the most important facts about Palau and Dongalia on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the Bay of Fundy on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was in the midst of a 40th anniversary celebration.
Dongla is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) along the Sulawesi coastline.
The Regency, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated halving of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the province of North Sulawesi relies largely on fishing and livestock farming, especially in the coastal region of the Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in the Moravian region, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palau and Donggala have experienced more tsunami strikes in the past 100 years, according to records from Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
The 1938 Donggala tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed thousands of homes.
A tsunami struck western Dongal again in 1996 when it took nine victims.
Indonesia lies on the seismic belt of the Pacific and is a regular earthquake target.
These are the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half the population of Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people lost their lives on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of Zaparna Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mantawai near Sumatra and triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A shallower earthquake struck the Pidijaya Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people lost their lives in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Trooper's on Saturday, 29-year-old Paylin of Basel, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police and report alleged wrongdoing, he took her phone.
Paylin is being held in Matsa detention and is being fined $500, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he appeared in court where he stated that he was certainly not guilty when questioned, reports the network.
Paylin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a day in jail and a fine of US$2000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with a crime report, and possession of a weapon in an intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face with a song.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that arose from the Iraq War.
Indonesia earthquake-induced tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media has been circulating videos showing the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saifov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people  which is a rare punishment not carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saypov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot-chartered truck to attack a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October and to hit pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saif deliberately killed eight people and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both points carry the possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saif on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and counts of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required substantial planning and foresight, prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it as vile, cruel and corrupt.
Sayfullo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, En-Lor Dicat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernán Ferruccio, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Panchoa, is standing in the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the southern district of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal case was executed in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
The indictment said that Saipov told authorities that he was incited to carry out the attack by ISIS video footage on the phone.
Police said he was also looking for an ISIS flag to be raised in his hospital room.
He was cleared not guilty on the 22-point charge.
David Payton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saif, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Peton said.
Saif's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP announces that Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference promised to mobilise the People's Army.
The former leader of the UCPI said politicians should face Euroscepticism  as one of the MPs Theresa May proposed, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone told a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would by now have known that Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her divided ranks is underscored by the Conservatives' staying-at-home views and joining a separate urban protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister struggles to follow the Chequers compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, left-wing supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist on continuing efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and forcing Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its offer and chaos.
Mr. Boone stated at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made even and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If I was responsible, we would have left by now", he said.
A Welinborough MP added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: 'We have fought world wars to be humble.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Boone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain completely false".
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter, also attended the protest and told reporters: 'I simply say: Prudently, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, not popular with our party and our activists who actually take to the streets and put us first.
Release the Chequers and start listening.
In a message sent to her, Mrs. May added: "Prime Ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.
Mr. Faraj told the crowd that politicians would have to face problems if they decided to pass the decision that was passed in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on its way to betraying Brexit, to feel the tide coming.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that won the Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city center.
A crowd of activists waved banners of the Conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, the Labour leader, took a grudge against the Conservatives over the security problems they had with the party's application since the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us they can put IT systems and all the technology to work on a 'Canada plus plus' solution, for borderless trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
Good Brexit, it doesn't exist, he added.
Vorenova plans to consider entering the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider entering the presidential race after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future in a city hall in western Massachusetts.
Worenova, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dill, a Republican who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There is speculation that Wornova could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
Some participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Worenova replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to rebuild a shaky government, and that meant a woman at the top.
Arrested suspect who shot Sims, LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting and killing of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at 11:00 ET at the conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
Wade Sims was shot in the head and the same train passed, Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told the media via 247sports.
Wade stood up for his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present, to possessing a weapon, and to killing Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 198, 122-inch junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton won the world title after handing over the victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walter Botass qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes would play a big role in the team's run.
From pole position, Botas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first went to boxing and let Hamilton get into the crowd at the end of the strip, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes started later and out ahead of Fettel, but Hamilton overtook the wheel after driving the wheel which inadvertently put the Ferrari driver in danger of retreating after a double defensive move on the third lap.
Max Fersteppen started from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for the most part to reach the fast finish and took Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
He went to the 44th round, but could not boost his speed in the remaining eight rounds so Raikonen remained in fourth place.
This is a difficult day because Walter drove great all weekend and missed me as a real gentleman.
The team did a great job of winning the top two places,, Hamilton said.
That was just bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not released a letter to the public from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were angry, disrespectful, and dishonest.
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, disgusting and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the ads and the leaks, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
It's not me.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you released this to the public?
Remember her response... did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no, I did not.
I'm not.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we publish it to me... No, we didn't, he added, talking about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter leaked to the public in September. Feinstein rejected claims that information leaked from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not publish her story", she told the Feinstein board, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep the story confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her denial seemed to displease the president, who during a Saturday evening rally commented: 'You know what, that was just bad body language.
She may not have done so, but it was the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They decided to restore power by any means.
You see evil, disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they must trample to get power and control, Mediaite reported the president's statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by a win on Saturday, in a 5-3 draw at Dundee.
The Giants gained a two-goal lead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowie.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kawhi brought home field advantage before Dwyer returned to the Giants' leadership.
Francois Boucher tied for Dundee before two goals by Lucas Landvood Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keef's team, who came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast, on Friday evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The two-time opener came in at 3:35 with Kendall McFall assisting, with David Rutherford providing the assist after Bowie doubled the lead four minutes later.
At the time of the busy opening, Sullivan returned the lead of the game on home soil at 13:10 before Matt Marquez assisted in a tie by Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead in the first third when he gave up a second hit at the end of the first half.
The home team was re-grouped and Buschar tied the game with a perfect score at 27:37.
Kawhi and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure the Dundee team's first-ever lead in the game at the end of the second half and took care of their team's victory in the fifth half of the final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their home games at Milton Keynes on Friday for the next game.
An air traffic controller died to save hundreds of people on board the plane from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after he allowed a plane carrying hundreds of passengers to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong strikes continue to shake the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palú.
Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Anthony Gunwan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower that was demolishing Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palou.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, had flown safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Seere said that Antonis' decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the morning passed before the helicopter reached Palos.
"Our hearts are broken by this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, given that the National Disaster Management Agency has announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims continues to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be reached", said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purvo Nagroho.
Waves reaching up to six meters [6.5 feet] destroyed the Palace where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: "Every moment of emergency is brought by the body.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the state army: "I ask you to work hard to complete all rescue tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lamboca affected Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Microgravity plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crash into lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person is missing, having previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon it had not been able to find a single passenger, a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the passengers.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuc Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some Witnesses believe that the plane missed the runway.
American traveler Bill Jans said the plane was flying low.
'That's an extremely good thing,' said Jains.
Jains said that he and others had managed to break through the water to the strait to the emergency exit on a sinking plane.
He said that the stewards were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair the harbor also helped rescue by using inflatable boats to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters [30 feet] below the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in crashes of aircraft of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.
Analyst shows the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the court that he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis to 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicts his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with a cell phone belonging to Cheybers during the time period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to witness on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because the truck was in Nashville.
Another disagreement was that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Records of cell phones show that they had known each other for only seven days.
Roullette said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis erased her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
He erased her from his life, Hale said.
The defendant should give the final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to continue that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop that raises awareness?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots  of political messages and solving social issues.
He wants to get back to the roots and renew the popularity of socio-political hip hop.
Performers such as Fujiz and Common have become relevant in the UK again thanks to performers such as Akala and Looki.
Another black person?!
Dudley in New York sued a couple for firing after a racist message
A New York nursing home sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was nursing another black person.
The couple denies that racists and the lawsuit are outside the home.
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"I am the only black person", Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending her husband, however, Miss Morris sent her twice.
When she realized the mistake, the dismayed Placebo-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, claiming that their current nanny, an African-American, was not doing well and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, reports the New York Post.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day's work and then Uber was called to take her home.
Morris now sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month job she was originally supposed to do living in their house, though without a contract.
"I want to show them they can't do such things", she told the Post magazine on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple rejected the racist claims and said that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
My wife sent me something she didn't plan on saying.
She is not racist.
We are not racists. "Joel Plastow, his wife, told the Post.
Or why would you leave your children in the care of someone you have been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Give me, please.
Comparing the lawsuit with the outside world, Placko stated that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and that she was in a very difficult situation.
Would you attack someone in that condition?
That's not very nice, the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly rejected the couple on social media and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
In the recent letter, we learn that publishers of Paddington's book feared that readers would not be attracted to the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkell, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It is very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's great success now.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before a small spiny bear inspired him to write this children's book, would have been optimistic even if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was bitter and sweet after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family, she said that her father was discreetly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet man and did not boast", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, he felt like people had a child who had accomplished something: they were proud of him even though they hadn't actually done anything.
I think that's how Paddington's success was viewed.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to apologize to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly to say that the condition was very bad, that he did not expect to survive, said Ms. Ednan-Laperos.
Then I received a call from Ned telling me that she would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, honey.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The action of the medicines given to her to keep her heart beating slowly stopped and the drugs left her system.
She had died some time before, and this was actually the end of the whole system.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to hold on.
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperus, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who did not know what hell she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I nodded my head, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer I felt immense compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning place suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
'I don't want one parent to feel what I have to feel every day,' she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydia, said that her son was a chef with great potential and an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up the room.
However, he gave up work before his death because his whole life was turned upside down.
After taking his own life in 2014, a brother who was 11 years old at the time found him.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be consequences".
Mrs. Davis made cards to let people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent  you need to talk to someone.
Ms. Humphries, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was sad or deprived or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day. When the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to put an end to it: "It leads to family strife.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go on and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
"I thought that if we really get something similar to what he was asking for, a limited-time and limited-scale investigation, we might be able to come to some sort of compromise", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would collapse amid strong party pressure.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican Party supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition came about because of timing.
We are only five weeks away from the midterm elections, which are scheduled for November 6.  If, as Republicans expect, they do poorly, they will be significantly weakened in their attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush continually calls on and lobbies the Senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic representatives.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the decision and send it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters fell under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean deserters fleeing to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawmaker.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byung-seok said there were 1127 runways last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tightened border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have crossed China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross because of the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views displaced persons as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea  which are technically still at war  have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on postponing denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula in a broader sense.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Cavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi stated this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribunals Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like this, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected accusations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were teenagers.
During the opening exhibition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his throat tightening as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the commission, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated assault on a person" organized by the Liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was seen to have prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated to give an answer when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
I'll tell you this. If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he's in right now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade law because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the subsequent hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and wait for us to say how wonderful it is", Pelosi said.
Women should be proud of it too.
It is justified criticism, months and years of being overwhelmed with anger, and she cannot shed it without tears.
"We cry when we get angry", Miss Stein told me 45 years later.
I guess that's not a rare occurrence, is it?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was the CEO of a company and who said that she cried when she got angry too, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would say, 'Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm angry. I'm not angry.
And then she would just go on.
I thought it sounded great too.
Tears are allowed as a vent for rage because they are basically not understood by humans.
One of my strongest memories is when I was at a previous office job where mostly men were once crying from unspeakable rage and when an old woman, a cold manager who had always been a little scared, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They will think you are sad and will be glad that you were so hurt.
Patricia Schröder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called the Monkey Job and dropped out of the race, a deeply frustrated Miss Schröder realized that there was no reason why she should not try to run for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and Seven Sparrows".
As the campaign was already slow, she ran out of funds, and vowed not to enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
That battle was doomed to ruin.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she wondered.
When she gave a speech in which she said she would not run an official campaign, she was so overcome by emotions  gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money for target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism  that her throat slammed.
"Some would think I had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schröder recalled about the way the press reacted to her.
"I would imagine a man being my corporate sponsor of Kleenex.
I remember thinking, 'What will they put on my grave slab?'
She was crying.
How a trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The initial stages of the trade war between the United States and China were stagnant, and while the battle is not even close to ending, the gap between the countries may be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation occurred this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has responded with the same measure each time, and last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US$60 billion of goods.
China has pledged to return the same measure to the United States and does not seem to expect the world's second-largest economy to change its stance anytime soon.
To withdraw, Washington must bow to its demands, and a public stance on U.S. terms would be too much of a disgrace to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S.-led trade war could in the long run positively impact China by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of economic crisis in either of those countries is actually much more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused investigator with the Center for a New American Security analytics center.
Syria ready for refugee return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had financially supported the rebellion.
Europe reports another victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National course in Paris, France.
The United States has suffered a sixth consecutive defeat on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the victory by giving the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured for much of the tournament, threw the ball with a teacup into the water on a par-3 shot at the 16th hole, handing the sword to Francesc Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and thus became one of only four players to ever win 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit is outscored with a 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Torbjörn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2-1 by England's Ian Polter, for whom this may be the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran who played in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European with the most tournament wins with 25.5 points in a career.
I usually don't cry, but I can't help myself today.
This was a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am so happy that we have won the lottery again.
Team is the most important thing and I'm happy that I could help", said emotionally Garcia after the European victory.
He followed his countryman John Ram who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his swords he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled with good moves throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented on his team's disappointing play. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point in the morning we almost reached Europe.
We tried.
All the credit to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We must worship.
We're up and down.
