A term that encompasses a variety of practical ideas, starting with the pursuit of technology or the technological imperative, and including the serious view that human destiny is determined by the logic that underlies the laws of science and its reflection in technology.
The many interpretations of technological determinism can be summed up in two general ideas: technology develops in ways that are not culturally or politically influenced, and technology "affects" societies that are not socially conditioned but are characterized by it.

Ocultic agriculture is agriculture where a farmer produces food that meets the needs of his family.
Organic farming is an organic system that combines growing in an ecologically clean area with stored seeds or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
The majority of farmers have been involved in organic farming throughout history, and it is still practiced in many developing countries.

Some wild children have been excluded by other people (mostly their own parents) and sometimes abandoned by their parents because of a serious mental or physical disability.
The child may have been severely abused or injured before he or she could escape or be left alone.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived independently in the wild.
A wild child raised entirely by animals without humans behaves (with physical limitations) almost entirely like those domesticated animals, such as fearing humans or being indifferent to them.
Project-based learning makes it easier and more fun, and scaffolding can do more than that.

The scaffolding learning method can be both virtual and real. For example, the teacher is a real life teacher, and also the little person in the Microsoft Office form can play the role of the teacher.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the program, and they're designed to help the student explain, ask questions, and explain processes that they can't solve alone.

No child should grow up without care, education and education, and yet this is happening.
We believe that family care is the right thing for children.

The railway bars were introduced much earlier to strengthen the roads, but later it was discovered that the rail bars were more efficient.
The Iron Age saw the first wooden wagons with a single wheel.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. Beginning in 1767, iron rails were installed.
The first known transport was walking, two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, people started walking upright.

Why do carrier systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are carrier engineers so incompetent? Or is something else seriously going on?
Transport flow is the study of the movement and interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.


To get a more accurate picture of traffic flow, we made a link between three key parameters: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roadway facilities.
