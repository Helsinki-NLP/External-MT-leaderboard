The tiger's roar is not the full-voice roar of a lion, but a sentence made up of roaring and screaming sounds.
Oselots prefer to eat small animals, and they can catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds, and most of the animals that oselots prey on are much smaller than the oselots.
Scientists think that oselots follow and feed by smell, where they find animals by scent as they walk on the ground.

When a small organism (a small population) is separated from its main population (such as when it crosses a mountain range or a river, or when it moves to a new island from which it can no longer easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment than before.

The real population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, new populations begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to become less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which usually means the formation of new species. Specificity is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.

Plants make their food by photosynthesizing the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from trees. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the best predator of his time, he was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were drawn with sharp teeth of more than 70 teeth, with an extra set of teeth at the top of the mouth, meaning that there was no escape from anything that fell into its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could be from a tongue-tipped shark. Its diet includes turtles, giant fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even be a hellhound.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex had nothing to do with it.
Though most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also ate some strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, peas, hammocks, and a type of rat called dermos.
The other difference was that when poor men and women ate their meals in chairs, the rich men preferred to eat together in a row.
The next century, the ancient Roman cuisine may not have had any of the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia.

For example, the standard size for most still-life photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the most dominant size of film towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still being made, but more importantly is the proportion that has inherited the digital camera image sensor formats.
actually the 35mm format is a bit confusing, 24mm is 36mm long.

Many common formats (e.g., the APS family format) are equal to or close to aspect ratio.
The highly-depreciative and almost-ridiculous Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates an atmosphere of dynamics by controlling the sequence in a picture.
It states that the most efficient location for the main subject is the division of lines that divide the image into three parts along the vertical and horizontal (see example).




The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and many questions have been raised as to whether it is being credited for this abundance of power and money.


UK is digging international reservoirs to prevent ships from entering the entire sea, which poses a danger to neutral ships.

The period in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).

TECHNOLOGICAL DEFINITIONISM
"Most technological determinism has two general interpretations: that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an ""impact"" on underlying societies rather than social conditions".
For example, one might say that motor cars are necessarily driven by road development.
At least, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically feasible, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.







Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.

However, due to the slow pace of communication channels, the traditions in the West can be set back by 25 to 30 years.

Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel they are being left out of the equation of social justice and helps them to build their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct because of the age, race, class, position and/or gender of the members.
The attributes that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various aspects.


"Such children are called""savages"" or wild. Some ""savage"" children are usually held captive (by their own parents); in some cases these children are abandoned due to the parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability".

others are said to be raised by animals; others are said to dwell in the forest of their own accord.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the wild child often exhibits entirely caring animal-like behaviors (within physical limits) such as its fear or indifference to humans.
project-based learning makes learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are experiencing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be either fake or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding but a little paper clip man from Microsoft Office.
The software integrates virtual scaffolds to help solve problems that are difficult for a single student to solve quickly and instantly.
From neglect to abuse to bullying, children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons.
No child should be raised in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and caring, and yet they do.
We realized that the foster care system is a safe haven for children.
Our foster care system allows for safe homes, loving providers, stable education and reliable health care.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Internet is a unified medium of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet have added an extra dimension from the point of view of use and enjoyment.
"For example, ""education"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as one of the motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)."
"When examining viewer feedback on websites, "personal engagement" and "relationship in disguise" were also identified by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new directions of inspiration".
The use of video recordings has led to important innovations in interpreting facial movements, small expressions lasting for milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can detect whether a person is lying, accurately detecting the subtle expressions of his face.
Oliver Sacks, in his letter to the President, points out that the brain defect is the inability to understand speech, but the ability to properly evaluate sincerity.
He even suggested that pets like dogs have the same ability to analyze human use.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two aspects to genetic variation: the hidden side and the revealed side.
mutations add new genetic variations and selection removes them from the released variations.

In savannahs, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from readily available plant sources.
On top of that, failure to do so has led to the rise of serious problems such as depression, malnutrition and premature death.
The most readily available plant resources are the proteins in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.

"All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in the same way that chimpanzees do now in savannahs".
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
The relatively quiet alarm clock can easily wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you reset your watch yourself in your sleep, you might want to put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed when you turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up and urinate.

The less thought there is, the more positive the presence of life force. The ability to find ultimate peace and contentment is within each individual.

It became common practice, but the iron was stuck on the wooden wheels of the freight train.

The earliest form of transport was on foot. Humans began to walk 20 million years ago when Humans of the genus Hamea erectus were able to stand on two legs.

4.2-3.9 million years ago, the bipedal animal characteristics are found in the Astrolepithecus fossils, although it is estimated that the Sahelanthropus began walking on two legs seven million years ago.

A binary number can have only 0 or 1 of these two values, and to use as a computer language these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Intramuscular toxicity may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms of vomiting are very common and cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal toxicity may be the presence of a free base of medication or a toxic chemical in the home.
Check the label for specific toxins according to specific first aid instructions.
The term bug is used by entomologists to identify this group of insects.

Biological watches have their own long-lasting oscillators that will last for as long as a free bike without any external force.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two studies, identifying the phase DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or the phase protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Genetic mutation can have many different effects, but it depends on what kind of gene is changed, how much damage is done to the genetic material, and which cells are damaged, the germ-line cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be administered to the baby, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape including flora, fauna and wildlife.




Science now suggests that this massive carbon-based economy has shaken the biosphere from its stable state that was ideal for human evolution for the past 2 million years.

In developed countries, you rarely hear these kinds of complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport managers make such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the interaction between two drivers and their vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict the movement of vehicles because the speed of the drivers is never understood with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to move within certain continuous ranges and thus the transport system can be represented mathematically within a reasonably reasonable range.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, design and management of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first creatures to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most butterflies have the advantage of folding the back of their bodies with their wings.
