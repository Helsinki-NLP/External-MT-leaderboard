The rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom has increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak Index shows that there are similar cases in the EU/trans-European border countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that COVID-19 infections are increasing rapidly in all countries, with a degree that varies by country.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients requiring health care, intensive care, and intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a mass outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control (China) announced that it has found the causative agent of the novel coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 cases develop pneumonia, whether or not pneumonia is present, or a mild respiratory infection, with most recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% of cases, severe illness was experienced requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we will examine the country-by-country potential COVID-19 outbreak situation in the EU/European Transit Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom, and compare them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom with the current number of cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After its outbreak in China, COVID-19 continued to spread to other regions, and other countries around the world experienced rapid COVID-19 outbreaks.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europeans according to the WHO definition of an outbreak was reported in the medical journal Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al., 5 March 2020.
The first three confirmed cases within the EU/EEA were detected in France on 24 January 2020 and were people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in 30 countries in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the same date, and one in Italy, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Recurrence rate of COVID-19 cases and number of spread
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the COVID-19 case count collected from the ministries of health of the countries, national and local health authorities, and official sources such as WHO, every day at 8:00 AM.
This data was used to assess the likely COVID-19 situation in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare the situation in these countries with that in Italy.
As a recall sample of current COVID-19 outbreaks, we calculated the recall rate of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK for a total of 14 days from 1 January to 15 March 2020, and the usual prevalence rate for COVID-19.
We also show the number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 compared to the number of cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
The potential status of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day incidence of COVID-19 in countries in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom is generally similar to the incidence in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
The overall EU/EEA and UK COVID-19 incidence rate began to rise around February 21, and then rose significantly around February 28, 2020 (in the supplementary edition).
This is mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, which has shown a similar increase in COVID-19 incidence rates (follow-up data) in all countries of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom.
Figure 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the number in Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The other 15 European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom have released their total number of cases as of 8:00 am on March 15, which is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the last 3 weeks or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 infections is rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed COVID-19 growth rate trends suggest that the epidemic is increasing at the same rate of spread in all countries.
National public health disease responses in countries are at different stages and in different contexts, and continue to operate despite country-specific differences in outbreak definitions and procedures for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including combination testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the Italian outbreak areas reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had reached their maximum capacity.
At the EU/EEA level, only 6% and 1% of the COVID-19 patient population admitted to hospital and/or intensive care units are available (data not disclosed).
However, they should be systematically surveyed to support current data monitoring, which focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study found that the number of beds in intensive care and long-term care in Europe varies significantly from country to country, with Germany having 29.2 beds per 100,000 people, while Portugal has only 4.2.
This means that these countries may have more resources available, but also less, than Italy (which had 12.5 beds per 100,000 people in intensive care and intermediate care in 2010-2011).
The projections associated with the availability of healthcare coverage are presented in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment, with the risk associated with the expected recidivism of hospitalized COVID-19 patients exceeding 90% of the number of intensive care beds available in EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Information on the number of cases and intensive care admissions should be made available to the local authorities for statistical purposes through the Nomenclature Level 2 (NUTS-2) system, as the disease is concentrated in EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units can usually only treat a limited local population.
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to control the local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and prepare for the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to disease prevention is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, along with a transformative approach from containment to mitigation.A lack of preparedness can result in decision makers and hospitals not being in a good enough time to understand and respond to the situation.
Rapid risk assessments also highlight public health interventions that could reduce the impact of the outbreak.
There is a short-term opportunity for countries to further scale up their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
Failure to do so could result in healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries facing a surge of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a human pandemic in China and other parts of the world, killing more than 3,000 people and infecting more than 80,000 so far.
Similarly, its cousin virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS infection in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by bats and may have caused similar symptoms through a similar genome.
COVID-19, however, was less severe and less lethal than SARS, but was more transmissible, infecting older people more than younger people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid proliferation of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
Our work will include studying the outbreak, studying the cause of the disease, studying the virus, diagnosing, treating, evaluating, and preventing it.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will provide a better understanding of the disease that threatens and help us eradicate it.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 was an unprecedented and memorable occasion for all Chinese citizens who were forced to stay indoors throughout the holiday season and for weeks after the holiday due to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease as CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across China and to nearly 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 discharges from hospitals, and more than 3,000 deaths.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number one and could be more powerful than terrorism.
As reported on PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), the first report investigating the chain of the virus after isolating several patients was made on January 7, 2020, and in the two months since, more than 200 papers have been published on the study of the virus, the epidemiology, the study of the cause, the diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.
This review attempts to summarize the research being done on this rapidly evolving new subject.
Whenever possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other CoV-borne diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an infectious disease that emerged in 2012.
We'll talk about everything we know so far about prevention and prognosis, as well as some of the remaining pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally harmless pathogens that are primarily responsible for an estimated 15% of the common cold stage 4.
However, in this century, we have seen two highly contagious CoVs in humans: SARS-CoV in 2003 in China and MERS-CoV in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, which have recently spread to other countries with alarming rates of infection and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Figure-1,1, the first report of a mass outbreak of cold pneumonia of unknown origin was sent to the National Health Commission of China in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the subsequent status of the coronavirus was released.
The first case of death was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, states and countries bordering the border.
On January 20, health workers were told they had been infected and noted that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan shut down the city, stopping all public transportation.
On 24 January, the first experimental study of the disease found that of the 41 confirmed cases of the virus, only 21 had contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, where the initial outbreak is believed to have originated from an unidentified animal.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the outbreak had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
The situation is evolving rapidly, and the extent and severity of the final outbreak remains to be determined.
The following link provides the latest information on the infectious disease, based on a multi-center study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of February 11, 2020 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects at any age, but primarily between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, with very few cases under 20 years old and only 14 cases under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more prevalent among men (0.27/100,000) than among women (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in large numbers, mainly in and around Hubei Province.
COVID-19 lasts on average 5 days (2-9) from the onset of the outbreak until a diagnosis is made.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset of symptoms to death was 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI, 3.51-4.05) and the positively corrected R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases had multiplied by January 23, 2020, when many transport vehicles were running ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate in confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the corresponding adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three groups most at risk of COVID-19 are men, people aged 60 and older, and people with severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of viruses that are large, single-stranded RNA, with a closed DNA.
They can be divided into four generations: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha- and beta-CoVs can be re-infected in humans.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the Envelope Spike (S) glyco protein forms after attaching individually to its cleavage receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dapeptidine peptidase 4 (DPP4), and then to the synaptic membrane.
Viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm: after viral gene transfer, the genetic RNA, consisting of a closed glycoprotein and nucleoside, is transformed into an infectious form containing plasma fluids, which combine with the plasma membrane tissue to release the virus.
On 10 January 2020, the first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, Hunan. Ten genetic samples collected from the Hunan seafood market identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new beta-CoV strain with over 99.98% genetic compatibility.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
When viewed through an electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the surface of human respiratory tract tissue.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a host for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 attached to human ACE2 is less potent than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may also be a short novel protein created by orf3b and a cell-expressed form of protein created by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 virus may be a sign of viral infection and may inhibit the formation of IFNβ, but does not contain any known effect domain or structure of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. presented the cryo-EM structure of a full-length human ACE2 mixed with B0AT1, an amino acid transporter, at a resolution of 2.9 Å.
The cluster with closed and open structure is formed as a dimer, and its ACE2-B0AT1 cluster can bind two S proteins, which can be considered as evidence of CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 could be a potential therapeutic target in drug trials to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host.
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via feral cats and camels.
A comparison of the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs showed that the new virus was 96% identical to SARS-like CoVs in bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, which suggested that bats were the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the species barrier to humans is still unknown, and the pathway of transmission remains to be clarified.
Ji and others suggested that snakes could be the intermediate carrier for the virus to be transmitted from bats to humans, as the mutations contained within the S protein are all homologous.
A preliminary study that found 99 percent viral genome similarity between coronavirus (CoV) in snails and SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the long-billed, ant-eating, mammal snails, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, could be potential hosts for SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to researchers in Guangzhou, China.
However, the 1% difference in prevalence in both bioreproducers is still a significant difference, and the results of the final analysis are awaited for stronger evidence (Figure: Figure-33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a test tube in a dry environment for 48 hours and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 is not resistant to ultraviolet radiation and heating at 56°C for 30 minutes, and ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated pesticides, peroxide, chlorophane and other fatty solvents can kill the virus, but chlorhexidine does not.
In general, all humans lack the immune defenses to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore not immune to the novel virus.
At present, no detailed findings have been published on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).
Typically, after a viral pathogen invades a host, the host's innate immune system first recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus causes inflammation, matures dendritic (immune system) cells, restricts viral proliferation, and the phagocytic cells produce type I interferons (IFNs) that accelerate the multiplication of the virus's antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV virus can help the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, an adaptive immune response was playing a role in fighting off the virus.
T white blood cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the prevention of the disease.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that fight the virus, while CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
The T helper cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the protective cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by causing T cell death.
The body's immune system, which is able to fight infections in the blood, including C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovering patients have been shown to destroy MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's overreaction releases a barrage of pheromone-like byproducts that can severely damage the lungs and internal organs, and in the most severe cases, can cause multiple organ damage and even death.
In the form of a cluster outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect pregnant women, elderly people with concomitant illnesses, and people with chronic kidney disease.
Typically, people who are exposed to large numbers of the virus or whose immune systems are weak are more likely to become infected than others.
A study of 425 infected people in Wuhan estimated that the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, with most cases lasting 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 patients found that the average onset time was 3 days, and the incubation period ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study based on the incidence of disease in 8,866 people as mentioned above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective period of isolation based on the exact period of the outbreak, so that the spread of the virus from asymptomatic infected individuals to others can be prevented.
As a routine, people who have been in contact with someone who is infected with the virus or who have been infected with the virus are required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the curfew and quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main symptom of COVID-19 in the early stages is often a cold, which may occur when it is not accompanied by other symptoms, but also when it is accompanied by coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nausea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and nausea.
Some patients have experienced shortness of breath and/or oxygen deficiency in the lungs and blood for a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly develop severe respiratory symptoms, hypertension, high levels of acid in the digestive tract, and bleeding.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and patients in critical condition should be screened for viral infection early, until lung imaging abnormalities are detected.
A local diagnostic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptomatic cases was 98% sickness, 76% cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea, and 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Two recent studies have shown similar conditions in a group of people who were infected by a family member and a group of people who were infected by someone who was asymptomatic.
In comparison, a 2012 population study also reported that MERS-CoV patients had nausea (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them require ventilator support, and this is much more common than in COVID-19 patients, which is almost the same as MERS, which poses a higher threat to life than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Fever (99% to 100%), wheezing (29% to 75%), shortness of breath (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13%) are the main symptoms in SARS patients, and respiratory support is required in almost 14% to 20% of patients.
The death toll from COVID-19 was 2% when there were 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide on 14 February.
By comparison, in November 2002, deaths from SARS were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
As for MERS, a population-based study conducted in June 2012 found that 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases were fatal.
According to an earlier study, the R0 (average infection rate) of SARS-CoV-2 was 5.71-7.23 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) to 6.47, while the R0 (average infection rate) of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their morbidity, mortality and R0 (average infection rate) is shown in Table 1.1 below.
In higher numbers, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower mortality rate than both.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more difficult to contain than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Mass transmission is usually within the same family, or from a common gathering of friends, or from a vehicle such as a luxury cruise ship.
The patients are those who have a travel history within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms or who have been in contact with residents of Wuhan or other areas where the infection is present or infected or with patients.
However, it is known that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, which could lead to the imposition of quarantine.
In the early stages, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normalized or reduced.
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients were found to have a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/L, a white blood cell count of < 4×109/L, and abnormal low lymphocyte count, elevated acetyl-CoA transcriptase enzyme levels, and the presence of viral bacteria in the blood.
Some patients had elevated levels of red blood cell myoglobin and liver and muscle enzymes, while most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell accumulation.
In patients with severe infections, the levels of D-dimer, a type of fibrin, increase and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreases.
Abnormalities have been found on chest X-rays of most COVID-19 patients, with the presence of shadows or glass-like spots on both sides of the lungs as the main features.
Patients are more likely to suffer from abnormal pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, it causes uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and connective tissue proliferation, which greatly impairs the gas exchange process.
Type-I and type-II cell dysfunction can lead to a decreased level of surface tension, which increases surface tension, reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and can lead to rapid lung damage.
The most severe chest X-ray findings therefore tend to coincide with the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first ever COVID-19 diagnostic study of a patient who died from an infection showed significantly increased pneumocytes in the lungs, a cleavage of the hyaline membranes, lymphocyte infiltration between blood vessel tissues, and pulmonary cysts.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection process is used as the primary standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, from RNA sample samples through the combined action of the RNA-producing enzyme and the polymerase enzyme chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, the high rate of false positive tests may have accelerated the pace of the epidemic, and the use of medical technologies for diagnosis (rather than relying on single-reaction RT-PCR) was introduced in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of diagnostic, clinical, laboratory, and photographic findings is essential and critical to effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 using the CRISPR technology-based SHERLOCK method, which uses a dipstick to be immersed in a liquid for less than one hour without extensive use of measuring equipment and to detect artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with a concentration of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microl of the input), in a range of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microl of the input).
Hopefully, if it is validated in clinical trials, the new technique will significantly improve responsiveness and well-being.
As no novel coronavirus disease has been reported, physicians may provide primary care to COVID-19 patients while testing existing or proposed therapies for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table)).
Treatments include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive agents, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, treatment with traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma has also been proposed for use in patients recovering from the disease.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibiotics and vaccines that fight the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 virus initially attacks the lungs, but may also attack other organs that express the ACE2 enzyme, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory disorders and degeneration are the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore important to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen circulation, non-invasive inhalers, and implanted mechanical inhalers, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with pulmonary auxiliary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technology that allows the blood to be mechanically circulated and oxygenated by paralyzing the function of the modified heart and lungs, which is used in the treatment of life-threatening cardiovascular diseases and respiratory dysfunction.
It is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients to prevent and treat secondary infections and blood clots by maintaining electrode balance and protecting the function of vital organs.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of an over-reaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytoplasmic hypertrophy of a cell is a form of systemic inflammatory response caused by cytoplasmic breakdown processes including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
The cytoplasmic disruptions in the collagen induce immune cells to produce large amounts of pheromone-like byproducts, which are the main causes of ARDS and other organ malfunctions.
In patients with severe disease, immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms.
Corticosteroids, tullesiuma and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat the disease of cytokine deficiency.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storms (cytocin overproduction) include the modulation of T cell-directed immune response, inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK enzyme, suppression of cytokine cell signaling 4 and HDAC inhibitor drugs.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressive agents in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory disease.
However, in SARS and COVID-19 patients, administration of large amounts of steroids for severe lung damage was ineffective.
Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially bone tissue death, and have a significant impact on diagnostic prognosis.
However, for severely ill COVID-19 patients, short-term use of corticosteroids in small doses to moderate doses is recommended.
No effective antibiotic treatment has been proven to work.
However, intravenous injection of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of infections caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was shown to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these facts, Gilead has provided the compound to China for the purpose of conducting synthetic tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricithin, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been studied as potential therapies for patients with recent respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after treatment with the combination drug lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between these treatments and other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Producing plasma and immune antibodies from recovering patients
Treatment using plasma from patients recovering from an infection has been performed in the past to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent infection of someone who has not been infected.
In patients who recover, the ability of their blood to produce antibodies to fight the disease is very high.
Immunoprotective antibodies are immune proteins produced by white blood cells, a type of white blood cell, to fight pathogens and other foreign invaders. They recognize and fight against the different molecules in the pathogens.
Based on this, plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 has been extracted and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms were alleviated as inflammation decreased, viral count decreased, and oxygenation in the blood increased.
However, before specific therapies are developed, the method needs to be tested and clarified for widespread use at the time of its introduction.
In addition, some of the side effects associated with plasma should be considered carefully, as the results of treatment indicate.
For example, antibodies over-stimulate the immune response, thereby causing cytokine secretion syndrome, which can become life-threatening toxicity.
The levels of protective antibodies in the blood are usually low, and patients with severe liver disease require large amounts of plasma.
It is difficult to scale up and produce specific antibiotics fast enough to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovering patients and to identify antibodies that are effective in fighting the essential proteins of the virus, or to identify the genetic codes that generate the effective antibodies.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, its effects depend on the combination of different ingredients that will be included in a formulation, which may vary depending on the diagnosis of a disease, based on the principles of TCM.
Most of the most effective components are unknown, or the precision for isolating and validating such components or their optimal combinations is uncertain.
There is currently no known effective treatment for COVID-19, and TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or recovering from severe symptoms.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rate for treating COVID-19 patients was found in several Chinese provinces, including Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), where 87% of their patients were treated with TCM, and the lowest recovery rate (13%) was found in Hubei Province, where only about 30% of patients were treated with TCM for COVID-19 patients.
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influential factors such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease need to be taken into account when making an assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone and combined WM and TCM.
The time required for body temperature recovery, symptom recovery, and hospitalization was found to be significantly shorter in the group using the combination of WM+ TCM than in the group using WM alone.
Most encouragingly, the rate of symptom severity (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% and 46.2% respectively), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% and 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still subject to larger, systematic, controlled trials that are widely and in many settings to be conducted.
It would also be interesting to identify the unique physical characteristics of the mechanism of action and clearly identify the effective components of TCM treatments or, if possible, its associated uses.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are often highly alarmed by the rapidly spreading and potentially life-threatening disease, while those with limited mobility experience feelings of frustration, isolation, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infectious diseases such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as treatment side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and emotional distress.
Various episodes of psychotic disorders have been reported during the early stages of SARS, including frequent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, hyperactivity, manifestation of bipolar disorder, hallucinations, and suicide attempts.
The mandatory contact tracing and quarantine procedures as part of the public health response to the spread of COVID-19 have made the community more anxious, and may blame themselves for infecting their families and friends, isolating them, and embarrassing them.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected patients, and those who may have been exposed to them, as well as the general public who may need assistance.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multi-role mental health teams, regular and clear communication of accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of high-tech electronic devices and apps to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for cutting the transmission pathway from infected animals and humans to susceptible hosts, where pathogens live, and are equally important for controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses as is antiviral therapy.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine based on the S protein for the production of long-acting antibiotics and/or immunity to protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccine modifications of live viruses have been tested for SARS in animals.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in elderly and life-threatening test animals and whether these vaccines will prevent transmission of the animal-to-human virus cannot be determined precisely until clinical trials begin.
This is also possible because SARS disappeared more than 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, occasional measles outbreaks and mass outbreaks of MERS have continued in the Middle East, and the disease has spread to other regions as animal-to-human transmission continues in the affected areas.
The MERS vaccination strategy was implemented using vaccines containing inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits (vaccines derived from identifying antibodies), and some of the vaccines tested in animals.
Producing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for immunocompromised populations is an urgent and critical task to contain the current outbreak.
However, the time required for a vaccine to be developed and for the various mutations of CoVs to occur is quite long (average 18 months), which poses challenges to navigation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only begun to show its full pathway after infecting thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without developing complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has been associated with severe illness and death in patients with severe infections.
Therefore, health care agencies need to develop a model of disease prognosis to prioritize treatment, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Clinical findings to date suggest that the following factors may influence or be associated with disease outcome in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age was the most important factor in the SARS diagnosis and was also valid for COVID-19.
As mentioned above, a study of 8,866 patients found that COVID-19 primarily infects people aged 30-65, with the over-50s accounting for 47.7% of these cases.
Patients requiring intensive care are generally those with poor health status, and complications are significantly more common in older people (average age of onset is 66, compared to 51 years old). It is recommended that age be considered as a factor in predicting outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Outbreak conditions and subsequent complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care may experience more severe cardiac arrest and arrhythmia.
Heart disease is also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to be associated with ACE2-positive cholangiocarbon and may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and susceptibility are not mutually exclusive and can interact with each other.
Abnormal chemotherapy - C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates inflammation or severity of tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictor of disease status, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between COVID-19 severity, prognosis, and CRP status has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely found in many organs, especially the heart and liver, which release these enzymes during tissue damage.
They are therefore common signs of liver or kidney failure.
Major symptoms: A chest X-ray and the progression of symptoms over time should be considered among other issues to predict the consequences of COVID-19 and further illnesses.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs that are often used as a co-therapy to reduce severe inflammatory pain in infections.
High doses of corticosteroids were widely used for severe SARS patients, resulting in many survivors suffering from avascular osteonecrosis, which led to lifelong disability and health damage.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be given to COVID-19 patients only for a short period of time in small doses.
Emotional stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, most patients experience extreme stress due to prolonged lockdowns, as well as the death of a close family member or friend, and the uncertainty of survival.
Psychological counseling sessions and long-term support are essential to help patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
To date, studies of the population in each region have suggested that COVID-19 has different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to penetrating the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also effectively invade the upper respiratory tract, infecting it in the same way as other CoVs that cause the common cold, and causing mild symptoms or no symptoms at the early stage.
This makes it very difficult to control the disease as infected patients may spread large amounts of the virus during their early stages or during their daily commutes during the recovery period.
However, SARS-CoV infection is thought to occur in patients in the acute phase of the disease, and is not infectious in its early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Excellent measures of prevention are currently being implemented in China, including the lockdown of Wuhan and its surrounding cities and continuous movement restrictions involving almost the entire population, in an attempt to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
These measures have significantly affected the country's economy and other sectors, but the number of new cases is decreasing and the pace of the epidemic is showing signs of slowing.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end in March, and the phase of recovery will last for 3-4 months.
But some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others predict that COVID-19, which is more infectious than SARS, will not be eliminated by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., constructed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the central airways and throat of patients who had been hospitalized less than 2 weeks after recovery, indicating that the newly identified virus has a seasonal recurrence similar to that of influenza.
However, there are some promising signs in China, where the number of new infections is decreasing, and the current strategy is showing results.
The number of Ebola cases could reach one million, with half a million deaths, according to the original estimate.
However, by implementing strict movement controls and quarantine, the disease can be brought under control gradually.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could become less infectious and eventually disappear, as does SARS-CoV, or become a less co-infectious viral disease in humans.
The relative prevalence of COVID-19 and the prevalence of SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with infectious materials to which the virus attaches.
The virus has also been found in faeces, creating a new possibility of transmission from the faeces and hands to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 infections, including 17 other infected people and 40 healthcare providers, found that 41% of infections were likely to have been transmitted in hospital.
Therefore, good preventive measures should be used to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients or people who have been in contact with infected people.
The first protection method that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is masks.The use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks can prevent fluids from a potentially infected person from spreading into the air and attaching to surfaces and materials, which are potential means of transmission to others.
However, N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against viral particles as small as 10 nanometers to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of viral particles are penetrating.SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, with both viruses measuring approximately 85 nanometers in size.
Since the particles can escape through up to five surgical masks that are fastened together, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with the patient should wear N95 (series #1860) masks instead of surgical masks.
Healthcare providers should wear masks and matching protective suits to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted to a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 through wearing an N95 face mask.The virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear face masks or goggles when they are in contact with patients.
As a public in areas of infection or susceptible to infection, it is especially recommended that everyone wash their hands frequently with disinfectant and soap, stay indoors, limit their movements, and strive to maintain isolation, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
For humans, standing at least three feet away from the patient is considered an appropriate distance.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and also to prevent the spread of the virus.
For the rest of the world, SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, but a report on 7 January 2020 found it to be highly similar to SARS-CoV, and China was alerted to the emergence of a deep-rooted memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, until 19 January 2020, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control (Wuhan) had reassured the public that the novel virus was not a problem to prevent and control the disease due to its low transmission and limited human-to-human replication.
This message significantly relaxed public awareness, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, a crucial time to keep the disease at a minimum in Wuhan.
The Centers for Disease Control in China will learn this hard lesson and make significant progress in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful in making public statements because every word matters to the public and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) respond more carefully to unusual and unique information from clinics rather than waiting for official statements from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in controlling potential outbreaks at an early stage rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) be less targeted and effective in publishing public statements more frequently and improving public health response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread across China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
The virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, so a COVID-19 outbreak can feel like a SARS outbreak.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the control of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, men more than women, and has a higher incidence and mortality rate among the elderly than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus from them even when they are asymptomatic, whereas in SARS, patients are usually infected when they are very ill. This makes the spread of COVID-19 more difficult to control than SARS.
This may partly explain why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may be found to have SARS-CoV-2 but may be negative on a standard RNA test.
On the other hand, cured patients can be reinfected with the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the surge in COVID-19 research, critical issues still need to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS CoVs from bats has been identified, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species that transmits the virus from bats to humans, the so-called original host?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the outbreak can reoccur at any time.
Although molecular imaging and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly did the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause the subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also integrate with ACE2 signaling cells in other internal organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not have quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus mutate when it is transmitted from person to person?
Could it become a pandemic, disappear like SARS, or come back as a regular flu?
The first question is not necessary, but it may take some time to get answers to the above question and many other questions.
But no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Genetic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for many years together.
By 2003, two human-transmitted CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The widespread outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been a major backlash in defining how devastating and potentially life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China in late 2019 has further inflamed the CoVs, surprising us with its high transmissibility, but less pathogenicity compared to its SARS-CoV counterpart.
HCoV transmission is animal-to-human transmission, and understanding the animal genetic origins of HCoVs will enable us to do this well.
Most HCoVs first infected by bats originated from non-pathogenic bats.
Intermediate hosts of some HCoVs have also been identified.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct impact on preventing human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-pathogenic host interactions in animals may also yield important insights into human CoV infection.
In this review, we present a summary of the knowledge about seven existing HCoVs, with emphasis not only on their clinical record, but also on their animal origins and interspecies hybridization.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral mutation and recombination of genetic material.
This topic discusses the current COVID-19 epidemic.
It also highlights the requirements for successful host-to-host infection mutations and the implications of viral mutation on the severity of the disease.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are members of the coronavirus family, which comprises a group of proteomics-containing single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses are named CoVs because of their crown-shaped morphology under the microscope, and they are believed to inherit the largest species among RNA viruses, ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases.
Structurally, CoVs have non-splicing genes that share a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the organic content consists of two large structures (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into coprotein polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which overlap each other and can be read from both ends.
The polyproteins act to produce 16 unstructured proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the structure of ORFs containing organic matter consists of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A large number of the specific particle proteins are also encoded by different CoVs genes.
Based on the different protein sequence effects, the CoVs pathogens are grouped into four families (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), from which the beta-CoV family contains HCoVs, further divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Genetic analysis evidence has shown that birds are the main clusters of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs, while bats and rodents serve as the genetic source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been subject to a series of species limitations, some of which have emerged as critical agents of human disease.
To date, seven human-caused CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are the pathogenic alpha-CoVs.
The other five viral diseases include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Infections with HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause common symptoms such as a common cold and/or diarrhea, which are mild symptoms.
Comparatively, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly susceptible to viral infection and cause severe respiratory tract infections, with a high incidence of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe pulmonary disease in many patients.
The first HCoV-229E subtype B814 was isolated from the nasal secretions of a common cold patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through extensive studies of both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which can cause limited symptoms.
Indeed, before the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infections with HCoVs were generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak, which emerged in 2003, was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing an estimated 10% deaths.
The next decade saw the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak result in a series of infections that spread to the rest of the world in isolation within the Arabian Peninsula.
The HCoV (2019-nCoV) that emerged in 2019 was later renamed SARS-CoV-2 and is the main cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
As a result, the world is preparing for the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Both HCoVs are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans, and both were initially transmitted by bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Diverse evidence supports the genetic origin of all HCoVs from mice, which are well-adapted viruses and show good genetic diversity, but no outbreak.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and spiritual challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic roots of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, including the driving and limiting factors of transmutation of species.
It may also serve to guide or facilitate the detection of host sites, intermediate and advanced infection of SARS-CoV-2 by the host animals, important contributions to preventing future infections.
In this review, we have presented the findings of animal-to-human infection origin, cross-infection and HCoVs infection.
Alternatively, we have highlighted and discussed the patterns of association of HCoVs with the source viruses that may not cause disease in their natural hosts, but can cause disease after infection within the species to a new host.
We have also reviewed the HCoV's evolutionary pattern of decreased incidence with increased infectivity.
The implications of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were also discussed in this context.
The animal-transmitted CoVs were first identified in the late 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E gene B814 was isolated from nasal secretions from patients with a common cold, different CoVs were isolated from infected animals, including chickens, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV detection is presented in chronological order (Table 1) to provide a comprehensive and informative overview.
The first HCoV-229E gene was isolated in 1966 from patients with upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently adapted to survive in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of the common cold, including headache, runny nose, nausea and sore throat, and fever and cough, which are common in 10 to 20% of those infected.
HCoV-OC43 was isolated in 1967 from a developing organ tissue and subsequent mutations in the brain of a mouse.
The diagnostic features of HCoV-OC43 infection by HCoV-229E are similar and do not distinguish the symptoms from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally and are mainly transmitted in winter during warm to cool climates.
Generally, the incubation period of both viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A human trial with volunteers found mild symptoms of the common cold in healthy people infected with HCoV-229E.
A few patients with weakened immune systems have developed severe respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "specific pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV-induced epidemic in human history, and the infectious agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV identified.
The first SARS outbreak can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
SARS also spread to countries and continents around the world, causing 774 deaths and 8,096 infections.
Except in highly active cases, it is estimated that there are approximately two outbreaks per case within 4 to 7 days of the onset period, with the peak of viral infection estimated to occur on the 10th day after infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV develop muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting, as well as post-event respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough.
Low white blood cell count, complications in liver function tests, and increased enzyme metabolism are the most common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Damage to the lining of the lungs, epithelial cell proliferation and proliferation of macrophages have also been observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients require inpatient care and subsequent mechanical ventilation.
The infection can affect not only the lower respiratory tract, but also various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, and is accompanied by a severe process of cell mutation called cytokine storm, which can be fatal in people with such severe disease, especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was initially isolated from a lung biopsy of a patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, remarkable efforts have been made in the detection of HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, elderly people and patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of diarrhea, conjunctivitis, fever and pneumonia are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study isolated the same virus from the nasal passages of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
The virus was identified in the Netherlands, but has spread globally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of respiratory infections, with its peak incidence occurring during the summer, spring, and early fall.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a throat infection known as laryngitis.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old patient in Hong Kong who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchopneumonia.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma exacerbation.
HCoV-HKU1, which causes mild respiratory illness, has been detected worldwide, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43.
All four community-transmitted HCoVs have become compatible with humans and are less likely to mutate to cause more viral infections in general, but in a rare case of unknown cause through accidental transmission, a highly contagious and potentially lethal HCoV-NL63 variant has recently been reported to cause severe respiratory distress in China.
In general, severity or pathogenicity decreases when these HCoVs become effective in transmitting and persistently present in humans.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia who had developed pneumonia and renal failure.
In fact, most laboratory-confirmed infections originated through the Middle East, and outbreaks of infections from elsewhere, occasionally transmitted by close contact, have been reported in various European countries and in Tunisia.
Another outbreak of the variant virus occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The SARS pattern and the MERS pattern are characterized by an advanced stage of severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, severe epidemic renal failure also occurred in many patients infected with MERS, making MERS isolated among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of infected patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed infections have been reported, with a high mortality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
A review of the known clusters of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, between mid-December and late December 2019.
The World Health Organization has declared the recent outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern, and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide with a 3.4% incidence of violent death.
The number of deaths in China is 4.2% in Hubei, compared to 1.2% in an open area.
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which exhibit symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
In some cases, the patient may have a stomach ulcer.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can escalate into an acute respiratory illness.
However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the 82% high genetic abundance of the organism's cells, and they are grouped into different sub-organisms.
SARS-CoV-2 has significantly fewer cases compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more transmissible.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been identified, which may contribute to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
Similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six emerging HCoVs are very interesting.
The period of the initial viral infection is very similar to the period of the HCoV infection.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general direction of six other HCoVs.
Second, the symptomatic severity of COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs that are commonly found in humans (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to exhibit symptoms commonly seen during infection with HCoVs common in humans, including cases that are not specifically symptomatic or are mild or asymptomatic.
In other words, a sub-cases of severe COVID-19 cases, although in a slightly smaller proportion, are also found in the case of SARS-CoV.
Third, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs that are socially transmitted.
On the other hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs, at least in humans.
In other words, whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased after transmission to humans, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, remains to be seen.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in contaminated samples, as can HCoVs.
Future clinical studies need to clarify whether gastro-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV infection.
It is particularly interesting to see if there is a detectability of the seasonally emerging SARS-CoV-2 as in the case of HCoVs from social-derived infections.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenesis, and contained spread once it occurs in humans will determine the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-transmitted HCoVs cause mild symptoms and are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be remnants of previous HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe infection in humans and people who have been severely infected with HCoVs are rarely isolated.
To do so, HCoVs replicate in humans to allow enough time for mutations to take hold against resistance factors.
In this scenario, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, the more people infected, the more likely it is to fully integrate with living humans.
If it does, it will be difficult to stop it from spreading in the living world through isolation or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, the community-acquired CoVs have been widespread among humans, causing the common cold in people with normal immune systems.
These viruses do not require a host animal.
In comparison, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have a high incidence rate, are not well-adapted to humans and are unable to control their spread in humans.
They are contained within host animals and must be able to spread, and they also seek opportunities to infect vulnerable humans through one or more vectors and host hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs that are present in humans.
It is as highly virulent as the four HCoVs that have been identified in humans at the time of its current occurrence.
However, it is more transmissible than HCoVs acquired through social contact and less transmissible than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still present in human-to-human transmission with no complete human or intermediate zoonotic transmission.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, let's discuss the definitions and characteristics of the pathogen-receptive evolution, nature, pathogenicity, intermediate and amplification of HCoVs.
An animal that inherits a closely related ancestor that shares a high degree of similarity at the level of the genetic base serves as the genetic evolution of an HCoV.
The ancient virus normally settles well and is not infectious in this host.
A similarly pathogenic host has been a carrier of HCoV for a sustained period of time.
In both cases, the hosts were naturally infected and were the natural hosts of HCoVs or their original viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV starts as an intermediate host before transmission to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and can usually become infected.
This receptor not only serves as a zoonotic source of human-to-human transmission, but also acts as a highly pathogenic host that can temporarily replicate the virus and increase the rate of human-to-human transmission.
If HCoV is unable to control its spread in the host medium, it can cause hopeless infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can survive infection in the host and can cause long-term disease progression.
In this case, the intermediate susceptibility becomes the natural susceptibility.
A review of the history of the outbreak and prevention data reveals that the first SARS case was a documented case of exposure to predators.
Follow-up investigations of the pathogenicity of blood tests indicated that the animal traders had the highest prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Cat turtles (Paguma larvata) and raccoons in live animal markets were first identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like virus.
The incident has implicitly contributed to the spread of SARS, which has not been reported since the killing of all the wildcats in the markets.
However, it has been shown that feral or farmed kittens cannot be infected with SARS-CoV without exposure to live animals, and that kittens are not a natural host of SARS-CoV but can act as intermediate host.
It is not excluded that various animals in markets, especially in Guangzhou, have antibodies to SARS-CoV that are present in 80% of cases, and that various small mammal species have been directly amplified as potential SARS-CoV host sites.
All of these appear to be the most recent hosts of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent discovery of the natural zoonotic receptors of SARS-CoV revealed a close relationship between the bat CoV and the SARS-related Rhinophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) found in the Chinese horse milk.
These mice have antibodies that prevent SARS-CoV infection, and also have a genetic sequence similar to SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other bat CoVs share a genome-based cell sequence of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have provided the basis for a new hypothesis that bats are hosts that carry pathogens that can cause disease in humans.
Several SARS viruses, such as the SL-CoVs, have also been identified as being caused by bats, but have not been isolated as live viruses, except for a specific WIV1.
Human enzyme-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a pathogenic receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 is derived from bat ancestors and has been shown to be highly sensitive to the use of bat, cat and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell-mediated disease.
Interestingly, the SARS virus was found to be less susceptible to WIV1 than the serum of patients with the disease.
WIV1 has thus far been shown to be most closely related to SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% of the genome-based cell sequence shared.
Despite the high genetic similarity between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that bats are not the direct hosts of SARS-CoV, just as WIV1 is not the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic biobased of MERS-CoV strains is the same family as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 groups.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are transmitted by the same dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymatic effects of MERS-CoV are genetically close to those of the milky beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been identified in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% of the same genetic base cell sequence.
The virus is transmitted through the bloodstream of the host, which is the body's first line of defense against the virus.
On the other hand, findings in the Middle East suggest that single-clawed camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV due to a lack of antibody focus, and similar to Middle East native camels in various African countries.
A separate sample of live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was extracted from the nasal cavity of a turtle, and it was further demonstrated that the turtle served as the actual pathogenic host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that infected camels, as tested with MERS-CoV, are generally not asymptomatic, but can have a high risk of transmitting the virus through them.
Infected turtles not only release the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for viruses to be released by bats.
However, in MERS infections, there was no history of contact with camels prior to the severe outbreak, and questions remain as to whether there is a logical human-to-human transmission or an anonymous spread involving a known animal species that has been infected with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% biochemical share with CoV RaTG13, isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for determining the relationship to the original.
If no bat CoVs are found that are nearly identical, it is likely that bats are not the related hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
It is thought that the intermediate stage of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic transmission may have occurred between the slaughter of wildlife species at the Hainan seafood wholesale market, suggesting that there may be early infections and animal-to-human transmission associated with COVID-19.
Several recent studies based on the results of genetic studies have suggested that a subfamily of mammals known as the dangerous manis javanica may also host the related source beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
This novel strain of the HCoV genome has a 85-92% similarity in the cell lineage of the existing SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 and are characterized by about 90% of the gene sequence.
They group together in the evolutionary tree into two subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses, one of which is more similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence characteristic.
Significantly different from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the RBDs are more diverse, but have a higher degree of genome-wide sequence similarity.
An initial study on infected ticks showed that removing viral overlap from lung samples translated into a similar association with SARS-CoV-2.
This study combines multiple sources of data and is notable for its attempt to cure human infections by inducing a partial biochemical effect of 86.3% of viral genome.
The shellfish also does not rule out the possibility of intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present, the direct descent of SARS-CoV-2 from the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been proven, based on the difference in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2, which are related to beta-CoVs.
Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection mutations in bats, bats and other mammals is required.
The highest sequence genetic similarity was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the serval, and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, shared the highest sequence genetic similarity in terms of lineage.
There is increasing speculation that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 affinity is driven by selection-resolution-interaction.
The reaction favors a mutation between the beta-CoV associated with the SARS-CoV-2 strain and a third wild animal species, RaTG13.
Mutation as a driving force in evolution is common among beta-CoVs.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains a deciding factor.
In addition to the HCoVs that have a high rate of viral infection, the genomics of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also being studied.
Genetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the original viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodent animals.
ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been reported to have been identified in North American trilobites that have been shown to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another mouse CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was investigated in Ghana, and is thought to have been transmitted by camels.
For clarity, the current scientific knowledge on the animal origins of the HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Bioevolutionary analyses have shown evidence of historical transmission between variants of HCoVs.
Around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory infection was documented when HCoV-OC43 crossed species and transmitted to humans via domestic animals.
The history of HCoV-229E's interspecies transmission is less clear.
The most closely related mouse alpha-CoVs to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is alpha-CoV, found in camels.
There is a variety of evidence of transmission from bats to humans.
In a shared ecosystem, humans may have first encountered bats, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are in close contact with alpaca turtles.
Second, the bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are differentiated in bats and are not pathogenic, while the alpaca alpaca-CoV causes respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV, which is found in camels, a type of furry animal, is not found in wild animals.
For this reason, the possibility of a furry camel-like animal infecting humans with a related HCoV-229E alpha-CoV cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that can infect humans, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the near-parasitic virus, and the guinea worm virus.
It is therefore not very surprising that bats can directly infect humans with HCoV-229E.
In other words, alpha-CoVs actually act as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, a type of hairy animal belonging to the camel family, and camels specifically act as intermediate hosts for transmission of the virus to humans, as in MERS-CoV infections.
MERS-CoV is the best-known example of trans-species transmission, not only from bats to dromedaries, but also from dromedaries to humans.
MERS-CoV, originally evolved from bats, is known as the initial identifier, and has been strengthened by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats are responsible for the inter-species exchange of genetic fragments and the transmission of a wide variety of viruses.
The long-term survival, tightly packed colonies, close genetic ties, and high flight capacity are all factors that give preference to bats as long-term virus vectors.
In other words, MERS-CoV has been present in the single-celled turtles for decades.
The direct transfer of disease from the host to a stable, natural host is well suited to the camels' situation.
MERS-CoV is maintained to cause a very weak disease in these animals, and to reduce the mutation rate.
Its rare transmission to humans is accidental and the virus's transmission is uncontrolled, leaving humans as the only host that cannot spread to other hosts of MERS-CoV.
Comparatively, the role of camels in the spread of MERS-CoV is different from that of snails in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The beta-CoVs, especially the squid, cause high infection rates in squid.
They may be the main host for SARS-CoV-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 related to feline SARS-CoV-like.
Various possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered for inclusion and declassification in future studies.
Bat may be a host for SARS-CoV-2, a closely related virus that has been identified as SARS-CoV-2.
The first is the use of the newly discovered fossil fuel, carbon dioxide, to produce carbon dioxide.
Second, the spermatozoa may be the enlarged host that initiated the emergence of the related virus SARS-CoV-2.
The virus is transmitted to humans through the slaughterhouse and the consumption of the meat of the victims.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
This is further confirmed by a survey of immunity between domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and colonization of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that is exposed to both bats and ticks.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the variety of animal hosts, three key viral components are also important in facilitating the crossing of interspecies barriers by CoVs.
First of all, they have a high rate of mutation during RNA replication.
Compared to single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be defined as a moderate to high average replacement rate of , with a rate of ~10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year, depending on the type of compatibility of CoVs with novel receptors.
CoVs contain the enzyme exoribonuclease, which is read and modified, and its deletion can lead to extremely high mutations, leading to thinning or even survival.
Remdesivir, a novel nuclear inhibitor, is known to inhibit CoV homologation via the restriction of this exosome and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising investigational drugs for the elimination of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is also about one million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when CoVs do not integrate well with the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower and a higher level of compatibility in humans is suggested.
The hypothesis is that it may have spread to other hosts close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also related to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-celled turtles.
Theoretically, genetic mutations may not cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs to be ineffective so quickly.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs provides greater flexibility during genetic modification for mutations and recombinations, thereby increasing the possibility of coevolution between species, which may lead to novel CoVs emerging at the time of the condition.
It is supported by a variety of open reading frames and protein processes that are coded to the 3' end of the chromosome pair.
Third, CoVs mutate rapidly and frequently during RNA replication by differentiating the copy-selective component.
The filament bias occurs during CoV RNA copying in a host that acts as a mixing medium.
High endogamy and recombination of transcelular RNAs may result in the emergence of new CoVs.
Evolutionary evidence of mutant combination has been found not only in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 but also in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral host response associated with infection
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the location of the host host and the interaction of the virus are other important factors influencing interspecies transmission.
In this context, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a common example of evidence of selectivity during interspecies cross-infection.
Based on a comparative analysis of human and feline SARS-CoVs separately, it is thought that SARS-CoV may be highly susceptible to mutations in the RBD of the S protein in different receptors.
In general, RBD in the S protein of the CoV interacts strongly selectively with the receptor and the antibody response of the immune system, which is composed of cells.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment, which is the co-infected host site for the virus, in addition to human ACE2.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize various ACE2 receptors in animals, including bats, roosters, mice, and wasps, which are the viruses responsible for infection.
In fact, only 6 different amino acid residues from isolated human and feline viruses have been identified in RBD, and 4 of them are located in the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations within its RBD that increase the inter-receptivity of the human ACE2 receptor and spike protein.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids could be crucial for human disease.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares a cellular receptor that is similar to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV within the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that its S protein has been able to alter the ability to bind to human ACE2.
In fact, cryo-EM studies have shown a 10 to 20 times higher co-synthesis than the co-synthesis between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also of interest to determine if other major host sites are needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection to spread.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2, but with a different subunit of S.
There are also several other HCoV disease reservoirs, such as the N amino acid peptide for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silicate for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful interspecies transmission of these CoVs in humans following their animal hosts.
In addition to the host's cell receptors, the outcome of interspecies cross-infection of HCoVs is governed by other factors and constraints that depend on the host.
The difference in protein acceptance between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, bats, and mice, may act as a barrier to cross-infection.
HCoVs must invade the host areas and invade the restricted host areas to achieve infection.
In this context, further molecular components and characterization within this critical viral-host interaction region are still needed.
The highest level of CRISPR may be useful for detecting host-site dependence and limitations for SARS-CoV-2 in non-biased genome-wide assays.
The emergence of HCoVs as new variants: back to the beginning
The strain diversity of the bat CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this view, bat CoVs act as a gene pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and combined genetic changes also lead to HCoV mutation, and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of genes encoding the novel protein has the potential to radically alter the external forms of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV co-proteins, the bat viruses associated with SARS-CoV were found to encode separate but distinct ORF8 proteins, which led to the hypothesis that ORF8 is involved in the human adaptation.
The 29-gene-based cell-blocking features of SARS-CoVs were found in isolated variants early in the human infection.
This deletion can be interpreted as a conformational mutation, with the grouping of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and as a mutation of the host.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with a large number of smaller recombinant domains isolated within RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes in the alpha- and gamma-CoV lineage.
Recombination sites can also be identified within the constituents of nsp9, most of nsp10, and nsp14.
A similar outbreak in Saudi Arabia in bats has shown that MERS-CoV has been found to have undergone a number of intergenerational recombinations.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination cases have been detected in other HCoVs, and the findings suggest that HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in genes that are not related to their structure.
It should also be noted that non-selective recombination can cause undesirable changes in the genetic code of the virus, which can be caused by the host's immune system, which is less sensitive to the viruses' selection pressure.
An example of such effects is the loss of the entire ORF4 in the HCoV-229E protovirus gene, which causes nuclear duplication.
While undamaged ORF4 can be detected in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV of the alpaca camel shows a single genetic linkage that causes a frame mutation.
Finally, but most importantly, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by forced selection within their host sites.
When CoVs are infected in bats, only asymptomatic or mild symptoms are detected, suggesting a cross-compatibility between CoVs and bats.
It showed that bats adapt well to CoVs, both organically and biochemically.
For example, defects in the stimulation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the incidence of viral infections caused by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the enhancement of the NKG2/CD94 receptor site against the killer cell and by the lower expression of the master cell homologation group Stage I molecules.
Furthermore, highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from the metabolic activity of the bats suppress CoV replication and act on both exoribonuclease and enzymatic repair, thus forcing selection for the production of pathogenic high viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV variants can also evolve by recombination, leading to the accumulation of novel proteins or protein profiles for mating with the host.
The emergence of new pathogens in the past two decades is therefore not accidental.
CoVs cause asymptomatic or mild symptoms in their host proteins, such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without taking away the immune response of the strong host.
Here lies the mystery of how severe infections occur in humans who are infected with no symptoms in the case of carriers.
Acute symptoms are caused by an overactivation of the immune response, and acute respiratory symptoms are caused by a stronger immune response, and more severe lung damage.
In contrast, the immune response is different from the CoV replication during asymptomatic transmission.
The same strategy that affects the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 immunotherapy, the immune response cut-off approach, may also be useful.
The immune response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, it may be beneficial to feed the type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the NLRP3 burst sensitivity in bats is imperfect.
For this reason, MCC950 and NLRP3 parameters may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been accompanied by a similar pattern of generalization as the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses.
In fact, bat beta-CoV has a 95% co-biocell affinity with SARS-CoV, and bat beta-CoV has a 96% co-biocell affinity with SARS-CoV-2.
In fact, the virus has been found to be identical to SARS-CoV in domestic cats and other animals in the market, but no direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
The conch-beta-CoVs were found to be significantly related to SARS-CoV-2, and it has been demonstrated that conch-beta-CoVs may act as an intermediate host or as a genetic complement to SARS-CoV-2 in its final form.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have re-emerged in recent times due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of animal-origin infections and animal hosts of HCoVs in the transmission of infection to humans.
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a mammal origin and are transmitted to humans through intermediate infections.
If the SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and the market's cat litter, then closing the markets for live fish and killing the cat litter would have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, as detected in the beta-CoVs, a family of tetanus viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, tetanus viruses should be removed from retail outlets to prevent animal-borne transmission of the disease.
However, further studies are still to be done to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via snails and other mammals, and how it is transmitted.
In other words, MERS-CoV has been present in loggerhead turtles for a long time.
These turkeys are a major source of tourism and a major source of meat, milk, wool and fur products for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is not possible to release all camels to contain MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A broad-based approach to effectively and efficiently develop a MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, combined with other infection control measures, is needed to halt the recurrence of MERS infection.
These viruses have not been eradicated, and new genes may emerge that are responsible for the transmission of the infection.
Different zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
Bat CoVs, especially those that are most likely to be zoonotic, are highly variable.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic CoVs will mutate and combine to produce new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly to humans.
The Chinese government has banned certain areas of China that have a culture of eating wild animals to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the difficult tests of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They live in their native habitat until they are allowed to leave the body.
However, although bats have many features that encourage the spread of the virus, humans can minimize their exposure if they are wise enough to stay away from bats and other wildlife species.
Continued monitoring of organisms is essential to better understand the ecological relationship between CoVs and their natural pathogen hosts, which may prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the spread of animal-to-animal transmission of viruses is to keep humans away from natural pathogenic reservoirs of animal-to-animal viruses.
Some pieces of the puzzle of the origin of SARS-CoV-2's animal-to-human transmission remain unanswered.
First, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and bats share the same relative survival status if bats transmit the source virus of SARS-CoV-2 to ticks.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmission to humans, then it should be analyzed how humans can be infected by bat saliva.
Third, if the third mammal is indeed a mid-level host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and bats.
Finally, many mammals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and should be monitored and tested for infection.
It is expected that in the future, the virus, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus, will be isolated in its natural host, if it is a bat, a scorpion, or another mammal.
Subsequent investigations may provide a clearer picture of the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with important parameters of COVID-19 prevention and control in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients need to be upgraded.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Prudential Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, which incorporates our experience and provides a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and understanding of it has gradually increased based on current research findings and experience in treatment practices, but our methods for diagnosis and treatment are also constantly being refined.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and stated the new standard of diagnosis of both the "suspect" and "confirmed" patients according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was identified as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
Our team has written a handbook of useful tips for fighting the SARS-CoV-2 infection, published online on February 6, 2020 in Army Medical Research.
Since its release, it has received a lot of attention.
It is important to note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and understanding of the disease is continually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice, and thus continuously improving diagnostic and treatment strategies.
The Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have published a total of seven revisions on some of the things that are changing as a matter of fact.
The new guidelines were developed by Zhou et al., who introduced a simple scoring proposal based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added new evidence to our guidance and will serve as a valuable reference in the fight against this global epidemic.
We acknowledge their remarkable work and show our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be revised according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition of the review) and guidelines.
According to the seventh amendment (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected event, if there is no clear record of infectious disease spread, one of the two clinical manifestations of infectious disease spread must be combined to perform a comprehensive diagnostic analysis, or one of the three clinical manifestations must be matched:
Records of infectiousness: (1) records of travel to or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, or other areas where COVID-19 has been reported; (2) records of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (with a nucleic acid test); (3) records of exposure to patients with illness or contact with other areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) records of exposure to patients with infectious disease during the last 14 days (with a letter to the school office); and (2) records of exposure to patients with illness or contact with other areas where COVID-19 has been reported, such as during the onset of symptoms;
Symptoms: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) symptoms in an X-ray of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count that shows normal, decreased, or reduced white blood cell count at the initial stage of the infection.
Confirmed cases should be based on the diagnosis of the causative agent or suspected agent by any evidence from a blood plasma study as indicated: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a whole sequence of strains associated with the virus showing high affinity for the known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody in the SARS-CoV-2 plasma test; or a negative for specific IgM antibody in the SARS-CoV-2 isolates; or a positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody mutation in the critical phase with ≥4 positive in the critical phase.
The second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions included real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid levels in respiratory tract or blood samples.
The blood sample for detecting the causative agent was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) revisions, followed by the plasma evidence in the seventh revision.
These modifications, along with the ongoing work of researchers to find the most suitable nucleic acid detector for rapid detection, will contribute to the development of a good specific antibody result based on respiratory samples, which increases the availability of different samples, including blood sampling, in accordance with the approved criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that warns us to be careful about patients who show unusual symptoms, as well as those who do not.
Therefore, they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk" and therefore the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be adapted.
The scoring system must also be validated by clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we would like to see more direct evidence and comments from readers.
We recommend that all suspected and confirmed patients monitor and follow the latest guidelines in their home countries for screening.
Our team will be updating our guide in real time to help you as well.
Bangladesh reports its highest daily number of new COVID-19 deaths in five days.
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a day.
This was the highest number of deaths from the virus in one day.
As of today, the number of recorded cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh includes 114 patients in treatment and 33 people who have recovered and are living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In an online news summary, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the patients were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told local news agency Anadolu Agency that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission (BAC), who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport will remain closed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The ban on public transport began on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of basic supplies, medicine, fuel and food remains permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
All three have been in remission since March 19.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The day the first confirmed coronavirus infection in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia happened on the same day set a new record.
On Thursday, North Korea said it was one of the few countries that had been completely free of the coronavirus.
As of today, the World Health Organization reports 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the last twenty-four hours as of 10 am Central European Standard Time (08:00 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus outbreaks have been documented, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS reports that more than 1,000 people died in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries have declared strict measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian citizens will not have to go to work until April 30 and will be paid.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for another 15 days, winning the vote by 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one against.
In Saudi Arabia, curfews have been extended to all day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, where they were previously only in effect between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand has implemented a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced the extension of the stay-at-home order in the state until May 1.
The Australian government has reduced the limit on the number of toilet paper purchases per unit in stores.
On Saturday and Sunday nights, Woolworths and Coles stores in Australia have nationally limited their supply of toilet paper to two packs and one pack per purchase in all stores.
On Monday, ALDI also began to introduce a restriction of one batch per person.
The restrictions are posted on checkouts and on the Facebook pages of the delivery channels.
The buyers are said to be storing goods in case they are required to live in isolation due to fears of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limited toilet paper purchases to one batch per order, as well as home delivery.
This change follows restrictions that Woolworths and Coles put in place on March 4 and 5 to sell four packs of fruit per purchase.
Coles reported in his March 8th news that many of the stores, which sell only four items per person, are still selling out within an hour of arrival, a demand he described as "unprecedented", though in a Facebook post ALDI called it "unexpected".
The company has been selling its products in the United States since the beginning of the year, and has been selling them in the United States since the beginning of the year.
The Kimbra Kosco store also limited the permitted quantity to two bottles last week.
To reduce the supply shortages, Coles ordered larger quantities from manufacturers and increased delivery frequently. Woolworths took over the supply and made the supply available early for the Wednesday specials set by ALDI.
Russell Zinnman, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are struggling to keep up with the demand for more stocks, but local authorities are limiting the amount of time trucks can travel.
He hopes that the cost of production will rise as suppliers struggle to meet demand and there are fewer special events.
Following early sales, ALDI announced on Tuesday that some stores will not be able to hold the special Wednesday sale.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, says that grocery stores are being filled with goods every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a time-consuming item, and that the lack of toilet paper makes people uncomfortable as it leaves a large space on the stage when it is sold out.
"If there are plenty of products on the shelves at Coles and Woolworths, such as toilet paper and detergent, and if there are a lot of them, I think you can minimize the gap", says Russell Zamran of the ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap, a company that sells recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that it was running out of supplies.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex toilet paper, and Solar Paper, the manufacturer of Sorben, are working hard 24 hours a day to keep the supply running.
The real estate website Domain.com was the first to offer free toilet paper to buyers at auctions in Melbourne, Australia, where sellers of real estate were given a long weekend off for Labor Day.
The Thursday editions of the daily NT in Darwin contain eight pages of cut-out toilet paper.
ABC Australia reported on 3 March that the stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on shoppers.
Russel Zimmerman added that demand for other products, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, laxatives and wheat, has also risen.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday, British online supermarket Okedo limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 12 packs.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, to be a pandemic.
The term "epidemic" refers only to the extent to which a disease has spread, not to the severity of the outbreak, and the WHO noted that governments should take the following measures:
Each country can still change the course of the epidemic.
"If only countries could detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their populations as a response", said WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We're taking a very close look at both the prevalence and severity levels, the alert levels, and the alert levels for inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "the most unprecedented thing that has ever happened".
In a comment published by CNN in February, he said that no respiratory virus other than the influenza A virus has ever been tracked to cause a continuous global spread.
Gebriyassof also shares the same view: "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
"We have never seen a pandemic that could be contained", he continued.
The WHO team decided to declare a public health emergency of global concern in January after a new global epidemic emerged.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, said the situation could get worse with the pandemic.
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, according to the AP News Agency, and more than 4,600 people had died.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the sudden severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and an estimated 97,000 deaths have been reported from approximately 210 countries and territories.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated to be around 4% in China and globally between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Secondary symptoms may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from infection to symptomatic symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment that can specifically target the virus.
The main treatment is symptom-based treatment and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth if coughing and sneezing, and self-isolation and surveillance if suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded with measures such as travel restrictions, surveillance of traffic restrictions, the issuance of curfews, workplace risk control and the closure of businesses.
The pandemic has caused a global socioeconomic collapse, leading to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events.
Schools and universities have been closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting an estimated 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
The spread of misinformation about the virus on the Internet has led to fear and discrimination against people of East and Southeast Asian ethnicity and appearance, as well as Chinese, who live in areas where the virus is highly prevalent.
The reduction of travel and the closure of factories has reduced air pollution and reduced carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a mass outbreak of pneumonia due to an unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and the investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The virus was thought to have originated from an animal source, as most of the cases were linked to the Hunan Bay retail market.
The virus that causes the infection is SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered strain of the virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, the leopard coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The earliest known symptomatic patient was later reported to have become ill on 1 December 2019.
Two-thirds of the earlier cluster of infections reported in December 2019 were found to be linked to the market.
An unconfirmed report published in the South China Morning Post on March 13, 2020, traced an outbreak back to November 17, 2019, with a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province as the first suspected case. While new cases in China have been declining significantly, there have been sudden spikes in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China has exceeded the number of new infections in China for the first time, the WHO said on February 26, 2020.
There may be a significant under-reporting of cases from the case register to cases that have only mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, only a few cases were reported among young people aged 19 years and under, accounting for less than 2.4% of the global total.Patrick Vallance, the head of scientific advisory at the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population could achieve herd immunity after infection.
People who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to official protocols are referred to as infected.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have legal policies against screening people with weaker symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of 23 January had not been detected, and that these unclassified infections were the source of infection for 79% of the classified cases.
A review of the data released on March 30th estimates that the number of infections in Italy is much higher than the number of reported cases.
The original estimate for the baseline generation number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time between onset and death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with a typical symptom duration of 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, the death toll from COVID-19 is around 97,000.
In China, 80% of the deaths as of 5 February were over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official death lists from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deaths that tested positive for COVID according to official procedures.
This does not include people who died without medical treatment, such as those at home or in a nursing home, so the actual death toll from COVID-19 could be higher.
Partial data from Italy shows that the death toll during the outbreak was 4 to 5 times higher than the actual death toll from COVID.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we are aware that the death toll is underestimated". Underestimates are made in the US, and uncertain reporting reinforces the statement.Such underestimates are common during epidemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.
Outside of mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy have recorded more than a dozen deaths each by February 28.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica have reported deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by demographic factors such as the number of tests, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, the length of time since the outbreak, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and overall condition.The death-to-patient ratio is the number of confirmed cases divided by the number of deaths in a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death to disease ratio as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The amount varies by region.
Estimates of the incidence-to-fatal ratio in China have decreased from 17.3% (for those who had symptoms between 1 January and 10 days of 2020) to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other estimates include the highest case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with the disease and have died as a result, and the highest infection-fatality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of people who have been infected and have died as a result of the disease, whether or not they have been diagnosed.
The figures are not data for a period, but data from the field of infection of a group of people through a process that is considered to be infectious.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
Estimates from the Reference-Based Medicine Center at Oxford University suggest that the probability of death from the spread of the disease is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimate for this scale is consistent with the results of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and the statistical analysis of the trial's impact on mortality estimates.
The WHO has claimed that the epidemic is under control.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are unknown and vary by location.
Al Masoni of Penn State University said that the outbreaks are likely to continue as normal and may begin to decline as the number of infectious agents runs out.
The first is the "Great Depression" in the United States, which is expected to last for about a year.
Zhong Nanshan, the chief medical adviser to the Chinese government, said the epidemic could be ended by June if all countries follow the WHO's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could be circulating for a year or two.
The study, led by Neil Furguson at Imperial College, suggests that social distancing and other measures are needed until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schnapfer of Vanderbilt University said that because of the rapidity of the spread, we don't see the coronavirus disappearing completely, and it's likely to turn into a seasonal disease that will reappear every year.
The risk of re-infection depends on the immunity of the population and the amount of mutation.
COVID-19 is not as symptomatic as it is in other people who are infected.
The two most common symptoms were high fever (88%) and cough (68%).
The less visible symptoms include fatigue, respiratory tract mucus, loss of smell, shortness of breath, sore throat, and joint pain, headache, chills, vomiting, blood vessel blockage, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. According to the WHO, one in six people who contract the disease become seriously ill and die.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends immediate medical attention if these symptoms are present. Further symptoms include difficulty breathing, sudden chest pain or feeling of pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty sleeping, and facial or lip swelling.
Some infected people are asymptomatic but tested positive for the disease, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with confirmed infected patients be closely monitored and tested for infection.
Estimates in China suggest that the asymptomatic rate ranges from a few to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is between 1 and 14 days, and usually symptoms appear within five days. An uncertain example is the estimated number of patients who lost their sense of smell or taste in COVID-19 from 30% at first to 15% later.
Some details are yet to be determined to understand how the disease is spread.
The disease is believed to be primarily transmitted by close contact and tiny fluid particles released by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Close contact is defined as within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without a mask can cause fluid particles to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus may also be transmitted through particles emitted from talking, which can remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory particles produced during breathing while talking may also be transmitted, but are not generally transmitted through the air.
The liquid can be in the mouths or nostrils of people nearby, or inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause leakage of fluid in the respiratory tract, which can lead to particles in the air and spread through the air.
It can also spread when someone touches a contact surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus is thought to be less likely to be transmitted through the urine, although there is considerable concern that it could be transmitted through the urine.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from one person's feces to another person's food. While transmission is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease, the virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms begin to appear.
The diagnosis is made three days before the onset of symptoms, so it is assumed that the infection may have been transmitted before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed infections, but these have been detected in some countries during follow-up investigations of suspected infections.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that although it is not yet completely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.The virus can survive on surfaces for several hours to several days.
Specifically, the virus has been found to survive on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
Humidity and temperature vary.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
Although there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, as well as after contact with sites where infected people may have been.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus.It was first isolated in three people associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has all the same features as the naturally related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus dies in household soap, where it dissolves its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a source that can be transmitted from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis suggests that coronaviruses are genetically the same group as the two species of bat-derived viruses, the subtype B (serbo-virus) and the subtype B (beta-coronavirus).
It is identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) with 96% accuracy across the entire genome.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome between the virus strain in the tick and two strains of the virus in humans.
So far, a comparison of entire clones of a living organism has revealed a genetic similarity of more than 92 percent between the coronavirus of the African anteater and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the African anteater is the vector.
Although the presence of viral infection can be tentatively diagnosed based on the symptoms, confirmation can only be made by replication of the infected person's DNA with a reverse response (rRT-PCR) or CT scan.
In a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but had poor accuracy, and many of the image features overlapped with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 or as a primary screening test.
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done with a breath sample or a blood sample.
The results of the tests are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is used for the oral and throat tests, as well as the throat test. Laboratories and companies are increasingly testing plasma for antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, they have not been proven to be accurate enough to warrant widespread use.
The US plasma testing trial, conducted by Cellex, confirmed that only accredited laboratories have emergency use approval.
X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scan people with symptoms, including the appearance of asymmetrical non-transparent sores in the lungs and fluid infiltration in the lungs, to look for unique features.
The Italian Society of Radiologists is compiling an international online database of the image findings of confirmed patients.
Because of the similarity of symptoms to other infections such as respiratory viruses, the diagnosis of COVID-19 cannot be accurately determined without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT scans with PCR, demonstrating that imaging is faster and more convenient, although not specific to infection, and suggested its use as a pilot screening tool in outbreak areas.
Complex neural networks based on artificial intelligence are being developed to image and detect the physical features of the virus with both X-ray and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, hand washing, touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing and sneezing on tissues and then directly disposing of tissues in garbage bins.
It is recommended that people who are infected wear surgical masks in public.
Social distancing practices are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned all non-essential travel to and from countries and regions where the infection is present.
However, the virus has reached the stage of becoming widespread in communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and individuals within those communities do not know where or how they became infected. Healthcare workers caring for someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further infection.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about the security of personal data, and International Peacebuilding and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile phone apps have been proposed for implementation or voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy data solutions, such as using a user's Bluetooth to get the closest access to another mobile phone.
Users will receive a notification if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Widespread misconceptions about infectious disease prevention, such as nasal rinsing and flushing with oral rehydration solution, are ineffective misconceptions.
There is no cure for COVID-19 yet, although many organizations are working on developing it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are noticeably dirty, before eating and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus is external to the human body, and the virus bursts the bubble of protective household soap, causing death.
The CDC further recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if it is not available for washing with soap and water.
The WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without washing their hands.
For surfaces, many solvents can be removed, including 62-71% alcohol, 50-100% isoprosol alcohol, 0.1% sodium hydrogen chloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% potassium iodide (by exposure to a water-based disinfectant for a cast-iron surface in one minute).
Other pesticides, such as benzalkonium chloride and chronohexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC urges that if a suspected or confirmed COVID outbreak occurs in a facility such as an office or daycare, disinfect office spaces, bathrooms, public areas, tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, and ATM machines where the patient may be in contact with a shared electronic device such as a tablet, keyboard, or remote control.
Health organizations urge people to cover their mouth and nose with a toothpick, cover with tissue, and dispose of tissue immediately after coughing or sneezing.
People who are at risk of infection are encouraged to wear surgical masks, which reduce the amount of fluid particles that can be spread by speaking, sneezing and coughing, and the distance they can travel.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing face masks can reduce people's exposure to their faces, which are the main source of infection, and lack good hand hygiene. Nasal masks are also recommended for those who care for someone who may be infected.
The WHO recommends that healthy people, such as those who are caring for COVID-19, should only wear masks if they are at the highest risk, but says that wearing a mask can help people avoid contact with their faces.
Campaigns have been launched in many countries to encourage the use of face and face masks by people on public transport.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical fabric face masks.In China, it specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks when healthy people are required to be in close contact with people more than 1 meter (3 ft) away.
In Hong Kong, surgical masks are recommended when using public transportation or in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are urging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
Czechoslovakia and Slovakia have banned public movement without a face mask or covering of the nose and mouth.
On March 16, the government of Vietnam called on the public to wear masks to protect themselves and others when visiting public places.
The Austrian government has issued a decree requiring all people entering shopping malls to wear masks.
In Israel, all people who go to public places and other public places are required to wear masks.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, announced on April 1 that passengers on trains and intercity buses will be required to wear masks.
Panama has also proposed mandatory face masks for all outdoor use, and recommended the production of homemade masks for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (physical distancing) involves actions that aim to control transmission by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Measures include quarantine, restricting travel, and closing schools, workplaces, indoor sports stadiums, cinemas, or shopping malls.
Individuals can practice contactless social ways such as staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using non-contactful speech techniques, and avoiding physical contact with others.
Many governments are now mandating or encouraging social distancing in affected areas.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered, recommended by US government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 to 50 (if there was no local spread of COVID-19), and then to 10 later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people.The CDC recommended that older people in areas of outbreaks and people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and those at risk of severe disease due to decreased immune systems stay at home as much as possible.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations were working to reduce contact with crowds or close distances, but to help facilitate understanding of the goal of reducing physical contact, the term social distancing was replaced by the term physical distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been interpreted to imply that people should live in complete isolation from their environment rather than encouraging them to interact with others in informal ways.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include encouraging sexual intercourse only with someone who is not infected or who does not show symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who suspect they may have been infected.
Health services have issued detailed guidelines to follow when implementing appropriate self-isolation practices.Many governments have also taken steps to encourage or legislate prohibitions on self-isolation for all residents in affected areas.
The most severe self-isolation and monitoring guidelines have been issued for members of the most at-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 or have traveled to areas or countries where the infection is highly prevalent are encouraged to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their last exposure.
Strategies to contain the spread of the disease are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Control is achieved in the early stages of an outbreak by tracking and isolating infected individuals or by other infectious disease control measures, with the aim of preventing the spread of the disease to the remaining population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer contained, the next step is to reduce infection: take measures to slow the spread and mitigate its impact on the health care system and the community.
Both the prevention and mitigation functions can be combined simultaneously.
More stringent measures are needed to reverse the global spread of the disease by reducing the number of primary infections to less than one, as part of the management of the spread of infectious diseases, in an effort to reduce the peak of infection as part of the effort to smooth out the spread of the disease.
This reduces the risk of health services being overwhelmed and allows more time for the discovery of treatments and cures.
Medical and non-medical interventions to contain the spread of the disease include hand sanitization, personal preventive measures such as wearing face masks and self-quarantine, organizational measures aimed at minimizing physical contact such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings, and community-led actions to encourage participation and participation, such as public engagement and face cleaning.
Other countries have also used different measures to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and quarantine, and has issued warnings about the movements of people who may be infected.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who self-quarantine, and imposes large fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face and nose masks and has sanctioned the storage of medical supplies.For Great Britain and the United States, similar tests found that there are major challenges in reducing infection (only slowing down, not stopping spread) and containment (reversing the rate of growth of the epidemic).
Optimal recovery policies can reduce the need for health care by up to two thirds and halve the death rate, but there are hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems are struggling.
The containment strategy can be strengthened, but if measures are lax throughout the period of the virus's transmission in the community (if treatment is available first), the infection could quickly replicate and the situation will need to be contained.
Long-term action is needed to contain the epidemic and it could have social and economic consequences.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop drugs, including testing existing drugs.
Taking anti-cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the infection, oxygen therapy, anesthesia, and ventilation support may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Many drugs that have been approved for other viral diseases are also being investigated for use in COVID-19.
The WHO also says that traditional and home remedies can help alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Improving capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental response to the outbreak, WHO said.
The WHO European Office and ECDC issued guidelines for hospitals and front-line healthcare services to change resources on several levels, including focusing on laboratory testing for COVID-19 testing, eliminating voting procedures where possible, quarantining and isolating confirmed COVID-19 patients, and improving intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available emergency ventilators and beds.
There are several theories about when the first patient (called Patient Zero) began.
The outbreak of the coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019, when it was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily rising in the past month.
Most of them are associated with the Hainan seafood wholesale market, where animal owners also sell their animals. One theory is that the virus came from one of the animals, or in other words, the virus had an animal-to-human origin. The mass outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on December 26, and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to the CDC on December 27 by Wu Zhang Zhang.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues that they had a new coronavirus similar to SARS.
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was severely reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.
The Wuhan Health Commission later issued a public statement on December 31 and informed WHO.
After receiving enough reports of an unidentified pneumonia outbreak, Wuhan health authorities began investigations in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of infections doubled every seven and a half days.
The virus spread to other provinces in China in early and mid-January 2020 as Wuhan became a transportation hub and major railway hub, with travelers coming for the Chinese New Year.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new infections, including two in Beijing and one in Shaanxi.
Later official data showed 6,174 people had developed symptoms and were positive on 20 January 2020.By 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy as the country with the most confirmed cases in the world.On 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
In Europe, the epidemic has led many countries in the Schengen Area to restrict free movement and impose border controls.
The national action includes measures such as restrictions on movement (also known as stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns) and curfews.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or 90% of the population in the United States, more than 50 million in the Philippines, more than 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India, are under lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion (one third of the world's population) two days later.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case was first identified in Wuhan on 1 December 2019, and the earliest outbreak was on 17 November, according to an unconfirmed report.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26 and reported the diagnosis to Wuhan Jainghan CDC from her hospital on December 27.
On 27 December 2019, a preliminary genome test of the patient's genetic samples was conducted, which revealed the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
The Wuhan Health Commission issued a public warning on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
While these warnings were being issued, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about the spread of "hoaxes" about the infection.
China's National Health Commission initially said there was no concrete evidence of human-to-human transmission.

Responding to the decision by central government officials to implement a transport ban in Wuhan on 23 January, WHO Representative Gordon Galeya commented that "it is definitely not a recommendation of the WHO". He said that this was "an extremely important indicator of the mental disruption to contain the epidemic in the most concentrated places", calling it "unprecedented in human history".

The WHO's executive director of health emergencies program, Mairead, warned of a current trend that "is something that every government in the world really needs to control: Wake up".
"The virus is on its way and you need to be ready", he said, urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid the "worst case scenario".
Ryan added that the current data is not strong enough for public health officials to declare it a global pandemic, and that declaring it would be a false assumption that all people on earth would be infected with the virus.
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO is extremely concerned about the critical level of infection and severity and the critical low level of response.

"During the current public health crisis, the lives of American and European troops are not only at risk, but also the lives of the people of the countries where they are operating", said Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticizing the Defender 2020 exercise.The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus, with about two dozen parliamentarians and fifty-five current or former political leaders infected.
The outbreak has led to calls for the United States to adopt higher social policies, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and increased funding for public health, as well as other similar policies in other wealthy countries.
Political analysts expect that the election of Donald Trump in 2020 could hurt the chances of his presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated amid the outbreak.
South Korea criticized Japan's "lack of clarity" and "lack of activism" in the effort, when Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-In's response to the crisis.
South Koreans have signed a petition to either blame Moon for what they say is his government's mishandling of the outbreak, or to praise him for his handling of the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed fears that the case could strengthen the grip of governments on their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán unlimited powers, suspend elections and parliament, and punish those who spread disinformation about the virus and the government's handling of the epidemic.
The global increase in the consumption of equipment to combat and contain infections due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to some instances of supply disruptions, including unnecessary cuts in consumption, panic buying and shutdowns of factories and logistics.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of pharmaceutical and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in supply.
The panic and the mass buying caused the grocery stores to buy everything from food, toilet paper and water bottles, which led to shortages in many areas.
As usual in the tech industry, the company has issued advance warnings about the delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal water protection equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand has resulted in prices being 20 times higher than normal prices and delayed the delivery of medical supplies by four to six months.
It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which could put health workers at risk, the WHO warned.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Australian-made goods to be sold to China, through the daigo (foreign-to-Chinese trade).
The movement triggered a baby milk shortage in some supermarkets, which was later banned by the Australian government.Food shortages have become especially widespread in both regions, as a result of the increasing number of COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the increased demand for food.
In response to the anticipated massive food shortages in Europe and North America, China and Italy have blocked the storage of critical products and smuggling.
Industry representatives say that while there is no big drop in the sector, which is critical for northern Italy's agricultural production, prices could rise.
The empty food shelves are only temporary. In Wuhan itself, Chinese government officials have released pigs to ensure that the population has enough food.
In Italy, there are similar laws that specify requirements for food manufacturers to store food in emergency situations.
The global economic downturn has hurt China.On March 16, according to a news media, China's economy suffered a major blow in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to slow the spread of the virus, with retail sales down 20.5%.
As a key economic and manufacturing hub, China has emerged as a major threat to the global economy in the event of a virus outbreak.
The economic intelligence unit's Arthur Damaris predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible outcomes is emerging.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the impact of the recession on global development during the current pandemic could be worse than during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
The impact on global supply chains has been estimated by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis to be more than $300 billion and could last for up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reports that the crisis has been triggered by the oil price spike and the lack of demand from China.
The global stock market crashed on 24 February due to a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections outside China.
On February 27, worries about the coronavirus pandemic caused the US stock indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall, setting a record for the biggest drop since 2008. The Dow fell by 1,191 points, the largest one-day index fall since the 2007-08 recession.
All three indicators dropped to over 10% by the end of the weekend.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH approved China's credit rating, but the rating remained positive.
The stock market plunged again on March 16, to its biggest drop ever, based on the coronavirus fears.
Many people consider a possible recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency response by central banks and countries.
Central banks have responded more quickly than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors worst affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the fact that governments around the world have advised against any travel.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quanta Airlines had to cancel flights due to low passenger numbers, and British domestic airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact of the pandemic on the cruise industry is at an unprecedented level.
The train station and many ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist destination associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland by their own decision, while state and local governments have cancelled many of the annual public festivals, including the annual New Year celebrations.
In Beijing, the Forbidden City and many of its traditional Chinese New Year celebrations and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City and the traditional temples, were closed to prevent crowds.
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces, cities and regions under local government system extended the New Year holiday until February 10 and ordered most businesses not to reopen until then.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has declared a state of emergency, including the closure of schools until March and the cancellation of New Year celebrations, as well as the highest level of infectious disease response in the country.
In Europe and Latin America, visits to retail stores have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of 50 to 60 percent.
In addition, the number of people walking to shopping centers in March fell from 33 to 43% compared to February.
Shopping mall owners around the world are taking additional measures, such as more cleaning, installing thermometers to check the temperature of shoppers, and canceling events. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America could rise to 14 to 22 million by the end of the pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic level.
China lost about 5 million jobs in January and February 2020, when Wuhan had a high rate of infection.
Nearly 300 million rural Chinese migrant workers are locked in their homes in industrial areas or are stranded in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 Americans lost their jobs and asked the government for help.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis estimates that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment as high as 32%. In India, the lockdown has left more than 10 million Indian migrant workers (day laborers) unemployed. According to a survey by Angus Reid University, 44% of Canadian households have also been unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers were covered by temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers were covered by a comprehensive debt scheme. About half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to government-imposed short-term work schemes known as Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work-related injury plan was adopted by France and the UK.
The outbreak has had a major impact on the arts and cultural heritage sectors, as well as the operations of organizations, as well as individual employees and freelancers on a global scale.
The art and cultural sector organizations have tried to support public access to culture, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to provide all possible support to artists (which is often subsidized by the government) to carry out their mission.
As of March 2020, universities, museums, libraries, entertainment venues, and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events, and performances have been cancelled or suspended.
In response, there have been intense attempts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly accelerating cause of the pandemic has been the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and music and stage events, technology conventions, and other social events such as fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered losses, and the Vatican announced that it had canceled its participation in the Easter Week in Rome, held during the last week of Lent, in remembrance of the Passion of Christ.
Many parishes have advised older Christians to stay home instead of attending Sunday Mass. Some have made it possible for them to drive to and offer services while others have made it possible for them to receive prayers via radio, live online or television.
The Roman Catholic cathedrals and monasteries in Rome were closed, and Christian services were suspended, and meetings were banned in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples, and synagogues.
The Iranian health ministry has banned Friday prayers in the infected areas and later closed mosques.Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims from entering the country and its citizens from visiting the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most visible disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
Plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July, were halted due to the pandemic. The International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the Games would be rescheduled to a date later than the summer of 2021 and not later than 2020. Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were shut down, and live poker tournaments were postponed and cancelled.
This event has led to a large number of gamblers switching to online gambling, and according to online gambling sites, there has been a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many bands having to suspend or cancel their tours.
The movie theaters, like the dance halls on Broadway, also had to stop all performances.
Some artists have found ways to continue and share their work on the Internet instead of the traditional live performance format, such as live dance broadcasts or web-based events where artists perform, distribute and share their work with audiences.
Many internet memes have been created about the coronavirus, as people have turned to humor and distraction amid the unrest.
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, East Asian ethnic groups and others from the affected areas have experienced a decrease in trust, a rise in xenophobia, and a rise in racism in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility are found in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia Pacific region.
Since February, reports have documented racist attitudes expressed by various communities around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or are being punished justly.
In some African countries, we have also seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many of the settlers in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their place of residence.
The Chinese government has been providing support to the Chinese citizens in the areas affected by the virus, not only online but also externally.
The growing spread of infection to new countries previously uninfected has led to suspicion and fear for people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe spread of COVID-19. Countries with citizenship of these countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, have issued initial calls for a ban on Chinese nationals entering their country in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending in Japan.
Asian communities, including Chinese communities in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasingly experiencing racial discrimination and violence.
Critics have criticized US President Donald Trump's use of the term "Chinese virus" as a racist and anti-Chinese term.
In the UK, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who were being evacuated from Wuhan to Novosibirsk.
Students from the northeastern part of India, which borders China, who are studying in India's major cities, say they have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Dil Gosh, the state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that God is taking revenge on the Chinese for destroying nature.
The comments, which could later be deemed "not true", were condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta. The pandemic has fueled fears of non-Chinese living in China and racism, which has incited incitement to describe foreigners as "trash" and "things to be removed".
Many newspapers that had access to news via subscription have removed the feature that would have allowed them to read all or part of their news on the coronavirus outbreak by subscribing.
Several scientific publishers have made scientific papers on the spread of the disease available for anyone to read.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results on bioRxiv's now-open servers.

Laboratory tests for respiratory tract coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods to detect the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in patients was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects and tests for ribonucleic acid (RNA) of coronaviruses.
This test is specifically designed to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
Recent or active infections are often confirmed.
Antibody detection (plasmography) can be used for both diagnosis and follow-up in the community.
Antibody tests show that anyone who has had the disease, including people with symptoms that are too weak to report, or people without symptoms, has it.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the degree of mass immunization in the population.
Due to testing limitations, no country has released reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests performed in many countries varies widely.
This variation also appears to have a significant impact on the mortality of patients who have been diagnosed with significantly higher prognosis in some countries.
Using real-time polymerase chain reverse transcription reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory tract samples obtained by a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swab sample or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test of the throat and the larynx is only reliable for the first week of the disease.
The virus then disappears in the throat, where it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In the second week, infected people can either use a deep-air suction tube to suck the sample material or use saliva.
In January 2020, an early PCR test using real-time polymerase chain reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) was conducted at the Charité in Berlin, and 250,000 test kits were identified as the basis for the World Health Organization (WHO) distribution.
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit on 28 January 2020.
It has been tested for the E genome in all coronavirus strains, and the RdRp gene is specific for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive approval for emergency use from the Chinese National Medicines Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test suite. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the real-time RT-PCR detection of the 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) to the Penang Public Health Laboratory and through international oxygen sources.
One of the three previous genetic tests in the test kit was not covered by the results due to chemical falsification and bottle neck testing at the CDC in Atlanta. It was less than 100 samples successfully performed on average per day throughout February 2020.
The state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing until February 28, 2020, when the two-drug trials were determined to be acceptable.
The trial has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial US laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics followed suit by making COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limits have been announced. Tissue sample collection and operations must be conducted in accordance with the requirements specified by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Healthcare Improvement.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that must be performed in 3.5 hours in large numbers, so that each machine will be able to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization to Abbott Laboratories to test Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cepheid received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for a 45-minute trial on March 21, 2020.
The FDA has approved a test using the isomer nucleic acid amplification technique instead of PCR.
This does not require the necessary coordination of the changing temperature cycle, but this method can achieve a positive symptom result in five minutes and a negative symptom result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these in the US, and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.A test using monoclonal antibodies specifically synthesized to the nucleic acid (N protein) of the Novel Coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, and is expected to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid test for influenza.
A March 2020 language review found that while renal scans have little value for diagnosis in the early stages, CT (computed tomography) findings may be present before symptoms appear.
The typical features on CT include the discovery of large quantities of glass lenses on both sides with lateral distribution, without uniform edges.
As the disease progresses, dominance, crazy placement and cohesion develop.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, was less accurate, but its findings are more likely to be duplicated with other pneumonia and disease progression, and CT is significantly more predictive than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for testing for COVID-19 or as a first-line test for diagnosis. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR as a preliminary screening test.
The immune response to infection is part of the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to diagnose infections, monitor immunity and monitor the population 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms.Diagnostics can be performed at central laboratories (CLT) or point-of-care testing (PoCT) sites.
High-throughput automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to perform these diagnoses, but their performance will depend on the rate at which each system produces results.
Sequential tissue samples can be used to study the immune response, but are typically used in a blood sample with the joints for CLT.
A single blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained by skin piercing.
Unlike other PCR methods, the extraction stage is not required before the assay.On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 organizations that notified the agency and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, the medical diagnostic laboratory Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and the company Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their pathogen testing devices, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies that can fight the virus in human blood samples.
It is capable of testing hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, much faster than conventional PCR viral RNA testing.
Antibodies are normally detectable within 14 days of the onset of infection.In the UK, antibody testing kits purchased in early April were found to be inefficient.
Hong Kong has established a system to house suspected patients. The emergency department will give the patient a tissue sample tube, which they will then spit back into, and the result will be known shortly after. The British NHS announced that the model of testing suspected patients at home is a pilot trial. It eliminates the possibility of infecting others if the patient comes to the hospital and should be disinfected if an ambulance is used.
Driving test centers enable South Korea to have the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors said on March 2 that they could carry out 12,000 tests a day in the face of quarantine, compared to 10,700 tests carried out the week before.
The insurance company pays the costs when the doctor prescribes the test.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to do a total of 160,000 tests per week.
The test will be available in many cities on March 19.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests done in Germany is unknown, as only positive results are published.
The first laboratory survey detected SARS-CoV-2 in 33,491 samples (6.9%) and produced a total of 483,295 tissue samples in the calendar week 12/2020, including week 12/2020. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously. Further testing is continued only if the test samples are combined and the aggregate sample is positive. A sub-laboratory in Wuhan called Huo-Yan (Chinese pronunciation of Chinese: 火眼, English pronunciation of Chinese: Fire Eye-eye) can process up to 10,000 samples a day.
The model, which was developed over a five-day period overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, suggests that if this testing capability is not leveraged, infections in Hubei could be 47 percent higher and the cost of handling the quarantine restrictions could be doubled.
Immediately, in addition to the Wuhan laboratory, the clinics in Shanxi, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai Huayan followed suit in 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the daily pass rate is 50,000 tests per day. Open source, many of them are sophisticatedly designed, the machine produced by Origami Assays uses only 93 assays and can test tissue samples from 1122 patients for COVID-19 in a day. Such standardized designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for liquid handling robots.
By March, the EU, UK and US had become short of reagents, a major problem for many test clusters.
This has led some authors to invent sample preparation procedures that involve heating RNA genomes for 5 minutes at 98 °C (208 °F) for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that more coronavirus cases were now being tested per capita in their population than in any other country, and said that the majority of the population had reached the level of availability.
The group 42 and BGI (Bureau of Geological Survey of China) have been working together to create a road map for the entire country, which will be available in the coming weeks.
The lab, which took 14 days to build, performed more than 10 RT-PCR tests a day, making it the first laboratory in the world to operate on this scale outside of China.
Various methods of testing to target different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has offered the German formula for manufacturing kits to low-income countries without requiring the resources to manufacture them themselves.
The German combination was released on January 17, 2020. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delayed the availability of the tests in the United States, and they were not available until January 28.At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to adequately deploy the test kits and the tests supported by health professionals until the need was met.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's widespread testing availability could help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has built up its testing capacity over the years, primarily in private labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization urged the acceleration of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The widespread spread of the virus and the high demand for testing has caused private US laboratories to cram tests, and to break down supplies and chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by the CDC contained "errors". The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Company Limited, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explains that the incorrect results could be the result of weaknesses in the collection of samples or the correct use of test kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would recall diagnostic kits that gave false results and replace them with kits supplied by Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology.The Czech Republic purchased 80 percent of Chinese diagnostic kits that gave false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million diagnostic kits from China and found that they did not give correct results.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be dumped into the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a high error rate and that none of them were used. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing and quarantine of infected individuals and tracing of those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 have led to positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, which reported the first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested all of the population of about 3,400 people twice every ten days.
About half of those tested were asymptomatic, and all those who were positive were placed under quarantine.
Travel restrictions may help to prevent new infections.
Through intensive tracking, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore was found to be much slower to spread than in other developed countries, without the need to severely restrict restaurants and retail outlets.
Singapore was forced to close schools on March 23, after many events were cancelled and residents were urged to stay home on March 28.
Many other countries have implemented contact tracing, restrictions on inbound travel, and quarantine to manage the epidemic, but not strictly, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that do more testing have a lower mortality rate in relation to the number of deaths, possibly because they have a better ability to detect weak or absent symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capabilities and limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten non-COVID-19 positive samples to one of 16 laboratories designated by WHO for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
The following table shows the percentage of positive test cases affected by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of washing one's hands with the intention of removing dirt, oils, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain times of the day protects against many infections, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are spread through the fecal-oral route.
Respiratory diseases such as the common cold or the flu can also be transmitted if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (the mucous membrane).
The most important times to wash your hands with soap and water during the day include before going to the bathroom and after changing a baby's underwear or changing diapers, before feeding a baby, preparing food or handling raw meat, or pork.
If soap and water are not available, ash can be used to clean your hands.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
The Bible says that "the heart is a lamp to the wise ones, but the tongue is a lamp to those who are wise in heart".
Before and after caring for a hearing-impaired patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning a baby who has used the toilet.
The first thing you need to do is to check the air you breathe.
The first is to avoid contact with animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygiene practices associated with medical practices.
Hand washing before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The main pharmacological purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and harmful or pathogenic chemicals from the hands.
It is an important practice for the general public, though it is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field.
Hand washing can lead to many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing infections that cause diarrhoea, and reducing respiratory infections.
Then, there is a lower rate of infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study showed that increasing handwashing habits may slightly improve longevity in children under five years old.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple behavioral changes such as soap and hand washing.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea by a third, comparable to the work done to provide clean water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as is done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main cause of death in children under five years, is responsible for about 1.8 million deaths per year.
Nearly 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia combined.
According to UNICEF, making it a routine to wash hands with soap before and after eating and using the toilet can save more lives than vaccines or medication, reduce deaths from stomach diseases by almost one-third, and reduce deaths from respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Hand washing is often associated with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents infections from direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing causes skin damage by drying out the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin flap cleavage, known as itching, itching, or hand blisters, which is common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is known as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five times a day when it is important to wash hands with soap to reduce infection from the feces to the mouth: after using the toilet (to defecate or defecate), after cleaning the child's stool (to change diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when the correct hand sanitizer should be used to prevent infection include before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing, after handling animal waste or handling animals, and after handling garbage.
In most countries, the availability of soap and handwashing is very low.
In 2015, a study of hand washing in 54 countries found that about 38.7% of households practice hand washing with soap. According to a 2014 study, Saudi Arabia is highest with 97%, the United States is in the middle with 77%, and China is lowest with 23%. Many behavioral strategies have been developed to increase the behavior of soap and hand washing at the peak.
The Emergency Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
The national program is based on the idea of using hand sanitizer twice a year, daily hand washing with soap, and daily brushing with a floss toothbrush.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is promoted by soap in water or laundry detergent powder.
The main function of soap bubbles and soap powders is to reduce the dissolving barriers and promote dissolving.
The fat and protein components of natural soil are not easily soluble in water, so washing with water alone does not effectively cleanse the skin.
But cleaning is facilitated by proper flow.
The reusable nature of soap packaging allows it to retain bacteria from previous uses.
A few studies have examined bacterial transmission from pathogenic soap bubbles, concluding that the bacteria are removed by the soap bubble and infection is unlikely.
The CDC recommends that more hand-washing soaps be used.
The company has also been promoting antibacterial soaps for health-conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of recommended antibiotics or of selective antibiotics for naturally antibiotic-treated germs.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have multiple layers of resistance to microorganisms.
So, even if antibiotic resistance is chosen, antibacterial soaps may not be as effective as they claim to be.
In addition to the use of exfoliating and skin-protecting ingredients, many modern formulations use pH-regulating acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antibacterial benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (which may contain tallow, vitamins, calcium, vegetable oils). A full review from the Oregon Public Health University also found that soaps are suitable for use as antibacterial agents, such as those containing tartrate to prevent infection and remove bacteria from the hands.
The ideal water temperature for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that retain dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the presence of microorganisms on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most are isopropyl alcohols or ethanol, which are formulated as freezing agents, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymers) used as gels, or as a homogeneous liquid such as glycerin, or as a foam to make them easier to use and reduce the drying effect of alcohols.
The addition of flexible hydrogen peroxide further enhances the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
Alcoholic semen sanitizers kill bacteria, including many drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses and fungi (including HIV, mumps, RSV, rhinovirus, varicella, influenza, and hepatitis).
A 70% alcohol-based hand sanitizer kills 99.97% of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of hand washing (3.5 logs less or 35 decibels less), and 1 minute after hand washing kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logs less). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norovirus) viruses, which are the most common cause of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.Rubbing with a hand sanitizer or sufficient amount of alcohol should be used to ensure both hands are sufficiently moist or clean.
The front and back sides of the hands, and the tips of all the fingers and toes, are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of rubbing with hand sanitizer when hands are noticeably dirty.
The preference for this solution is based on its ease of use and its ability to kill microbes quickly, but it should not be substituted for washing with the correct water and soap if available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if no emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the lotions.
The skin-drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding cosmetic ointments and/or other skin-tender lotions to the makeup.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing skin emollients caused more minor itching and dryness than soaps or antibacterial lotions.
Allergic reactions to chemicals, such as skin rashes, contact phloem syndrome, or allergic reactions to alcohol, or dependence on alcohol-based hand wipes, are rare.
Interestingly, there are fewer cases of skin rashes caused by irritating contact compared to hand washing with soap and water.
While these are effective, non-water hand sanitizers do not disinfect hands, but simply sterilize them.
This is because pathogens remain on the hands, and hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends greatly on the ingredients and the formula, and has historically been significantly lower than the effectiveness of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
Recent formulations using benzalkonium chloride, unlike alkaloids, which have been shown to have a consistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, with a possible decrease in efficacy due to increased adverse skin reactions after additional use.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap, and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or earth may be more effective than water alone, but not as effective as soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it could increase the spread of the disease rather than reducing it.
Like soap, ash is a bactericidal agent because it forms alkali liquids when it comes into contact with water.
The WHO recommends using ash and sand instead of soap when it is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for preventing infections includes the following steps:
Keep your hands moist with hot or cold running water.
The water is usually kept at a constant temperature, and the water is then used to clean the dishes.
Wash your hands with soap and water, including the palms of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails, until the foam is gone.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap, not just water.
Rub and rinse for at least 20 seconds.
The rubbing causes friction, so it removes bacteria from the skin, and prolonged rubbing removes more bacteria.
Rinse thoroughly with constant flowing water.
Hand washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry it off with a clean towel or air dry it.
Wet hands and wet hands are susceptible to germs. The most commonly contaminated areas are the thumb, wrist, middle fingers, and the undersides of the nails.
Nail polishes that are separated from the nail polish may accumulate microorganisms.
To prevent dry hands, skin moisturizers are often recommended. Dry skin can cause skin damage, which in turn increases the risk of spreading infections.
"For example, where there is no access to public water and/or soap, using a water drain from a suspended rectangular bucket or a dry can with appropriate sized holes and/or using ash, if necessary in developing countries, can provide a variety of less costly options for performing hand washing. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water saving solutions such as 'tap pipes' and other less costly options".
Taping is a simple technique that involves pulling a rope around a water bottle and using a foot to pour a small amount of water onto the soap and hands.
While effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand sanitization process, there is still debate about the most efficient way to dry hands in public toilets.
A large amount of research suggests that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a tissue manufacturer, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene standards of tissue paper, air-dried hand dryers, and more modern air-dried hand dryers for immunization.
After washing your hands and drying them with a hand dryer, the total number of bacteria on your fingers increases by an average of 194 percent, and on the palms by 254 percent.
Air drying increases the total number of bacteria in the fingers by an average of 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing hands and wiping with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on fingers and 77% on palms. The scientists tested each method of drying to confirm whether it could spread to other toilet users and the toilet environment.
At 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), the hand dryer, which blows air from the machine, is capable of pumping out microorganisms from the hands and the machine to other users of the toilet and the surrounding area of the toilet, up to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of hot air dryers allows the microorganisms to spread up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
There is no significant microbial contamination in towels. In a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After drying the hands, we saw the following changes in the bacterial population:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and a comparison of hand drying with towels and hand dryers has been made.
Using hand sanitizer is a useful method when traveling where soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand-washing has become a medical necessity in the hospital environment long after the discovery of the effect of hand-washing on disease prevention by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (in 1846).
The hospital has electronic devices that can alert and respond when staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that they reduced infection rates.
Medical handwashing is the use of a hand to rub each part of the hand with a drop of soap and water or a gel onto the skin for at least 15 seconds.
The hands should be rubbed with the fingers.
Bristle brushes can be used to remove any debris under the nails.
Microbes can remain in the water on the hands, so it is important to remove the water and dry it with a clean washcloth.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and if necessary, open one of the outlet doors).
It prevents the spread of infection from these surfaces to the hands.
"The purpose of handwashing in a health care facility is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (""pathogens") and to avoid their transmission".
The New England Journal of Medicine notes that while poor handwashing remains an unacceptable standard in most medical settings, a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching a patient, and this can lead to infection of microorganisms.
Proper hand washing and other simple procedures have been shown in one study to reduce the rate of blood-borne infections associated with tetanus by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has distributed a leaflet to healthcare organizations that describes standard hand washing and hand rubbing.
The organization's hand hygiene guidelines are also available for public comment on its website.
The study was conducted by Whitby et al.
Vending machines can measure and verify hand hygiene if compliance with regulatory requirements is required.
"The World Health Organization has identified five 'moments' for hand washing -
The first is the blood/internal fluid.
Before the germ-free operation, and
After care and treatment of the patient, additional antiseptic chemicals (antibiotic or antimicrobial soaps containing antibiotics) are added to the disinfectant's effect on the hand sanitizer.
Such a procedure is required in cases where antibiotic-treated microorganisms are present or before surgery. For surgical procedures, a person's hand is washed without manual contact by a closed tap, a chlorinated acid or iodine solution, a disinfected towel for washing and drying, and a disinfected brush for rubbing and another disinfectant for cleaning under the kidneys are not required.
You should take off all your gloves.
This procedure requires washing the hands and fingers up to the elbows for generally 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't need to be a long, 10-minute workout.
And the water that is in the hand shall be removed from the hand, and the water that is in the hand shall be cut off.
After washing your hands, dry them with a cloth that has been sterilized, and put on your surgical uniform.
To reduce the transmission of germs, hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer should be used before and after treating a sick person.
In hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand washing for the control of staphylococcal infections was seen at the first 20% of washings, and very little additional benefit was seen at the time of increasing hand washing frequency by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing with plain soap has a three times higher rate of bacterial infection to food. Washing with alcohol-based fluids and antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds reduces the concentration of bacteria by 26% compared to washing with antibacterial soap and soap.
Hand washing with soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers for reducing the number of H1N1 influenza A viruses and clostridium difficile viruses that cause diarrhea. Measures to promote hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating staff about hand washing, promoting awareness, and increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers through verbal alerting staff.
The study of the most effective of these measures in different healthcare settings is needed.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap and water is recognized as a cost-effective and critical way to maintain good health and nutrition.
However, the lack of access to sufficient water, soap, or hand sanitizer in homes, schools, and workplaces can be a challenge to the adoption of good hand washing practices worldwide.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are inexpensive options to build hand washing basins, but very few hand washing basins are near private or public toilets.
But I would argue that the decrease in handwashing is more related to the habits of the people than to the lack of soap or water.
Promoting and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes for many people.
It requires monitoring and evaluation to work effectively.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based action methods were effective in increasing handwashing practices in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries), while social media marketing campaigns were less effective.An example of promoting handwashing practices in schools is UNICEF's Global Handwashing App, which encourages students to use simple and cost-effective methods in schools to ensure they wash their hands with a hand sanitizer.
When meeting the minimum standards, schools can range from one star to a maximum of three stars.
The construction of hand washing facilities can be part of a movement to promote hand washing that aims to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is an example of a consciousness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve behavioural change.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the use of handwashing emojis.
Some studies have considered the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries by avoiding DALYs.
However, one review found that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly less expensive than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in sensitive situations such as mothers after birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of private hand hygiene, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna, Austria, and the English founder of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale.
The majority of people still believe that the infections were caused by bad smells, called miasmas.
In the 1980s, the spread of foodborne infections and health care-associated infections led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap and detergent to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, public toilets and offices and handwashing basins in airports have posters with the correct handwashing methods.
The phrase "wash your hands" is meant to declare that someone does not have to take responsibility for something or share in it.
It originated in the biblical text of Matthew, where the rebellious Pilate washed his hands for the decision to crucify Jesus, but has become a phrase more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands fervently, trying to cleanse the stained image, reflecting her guilty conscience about the crimes she has committed and the sins she encouraged her husband to commit.
People wash their hands more often than others after remembering or reflecting on unethical behavior, and they value hand washing devices more.
In addition, those who have been given this kind of attention and then later wash their hands are less likely to engage in other alternative sanitation activities, such as volunteering.
Religious orders prescribe handwashing for hygiene and ceremonial purposes. Using only water to wash hands, and not soap, ceremonial handwashing is a form of traditional handwashing used in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, the Jewish faith of the Tuva and the Nahuatl Yiddish, the Lavo in Christianity, and the Judaism in Islam. Religious orders also prescribe handwashing in a healthy manner after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam teach us to wash our hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims practice hand washing before eating.
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19: The first of these is the use of the "Customized" (C) method.
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 include the use of workplace safety and health measures for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control in the workplace depends on workplace and work objectives, risk testing of exposure sources, severity of illness in the community, and factors that can pose a risk to individual workers who may potentially contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with minimal contact with the general public and other colleagues are those with a low risk of infection, and it recommends basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing for such occupations, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, enforcing a protocol for not to sneeze or cough, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace environment.
Positive risk of infection includes jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, as well as jobs that may be exposed to infection due to community transmission or international travel.
This includes schools, densely populated workplaces, and workers exposed to the general public, such as in situations where some car sales are high.
In addition to infectious disease prevention measures, risk controls for this group include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze protection, and personal protective equipment if necessary in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
Health care or mortuary workers who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of exposure, and workers who collect or handle tissue samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients or handle airborne particles are considered to be at very high risk of exposure by OSHA.
Suitable risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as rooms with negative pressure and good ventilation and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job objective.
The COVID-19 outbreak has many implications in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, need to provide care to others, or fear of possible exposure.
The patterns of trade can vary both in the goods in demand and in how those goods are obtained (e.g. by avoiding rush hour shopping, or by delivery or carpooling services).
Finally, imports of supplies from areas where COVID-19 has been highly spread may be delayed.The Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan may be used as a guide for preventive actions.
The projects address a range of risk factors for individual workers, such as exposure sources, including risks associated with different workplaces and business objectives, risks arising from existing home and community structures, and risk factors such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also indicate the controls needed to address these risks and provide backup measures for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases are based on national or regional recommendations.
The goals for the response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at higher risk for subsequent health events, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other businesses on their supply chains.
In the community where the work is done, the severity of the disease affects the response.
The Risk Management Scale is a widely used framework in occupational health and safety to group risk management measures according to their effectiveness.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by management controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls, which involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on the worker's habits, may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Executive control is a change in work policies or procedures that a worker or employer is required to make.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) may help protect against some exposures, although it is not as effective as engineering and management controls.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the hazards of the workplace for the worker, properly fitted (e.g. breathing holes), uniform and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, replaced as necessary, properly removed and cleaned, and then stored or disposed of without any further action.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a low exposure risk have the least amount of physical contact with the public and other co-workers.
Recommended basic infectious disease prevention activities for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay indoors if the weather is bad, covering coughs and sneezes, giving tissues and disposing of waste, respiratory behaviors including giving and taking away, preparing for remote communication or separating work shifts if necessary, prohibiting workers from using other programs and equipment, and maintaining and disinfecting the workplace and environment with regular hygiene practices.
Early detection and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges employees with symptoms of sudden respiratory illness to stay home until they have had at least 24 hours of no fever, symptoms of high fever, or other symptoms without the use of fever-reducing or antipyretic medication, and to make sick leave policies flexible, allowing employees to stay home and care for family members who are ill, and to inform employees of its policies.
According to OSHA, work involving frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of a suspected COVID-19 patient or unknown person is considered moderate risk, but the person may have recently traveled across the country to an area where COVID-19 was circulating, or may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to a local outbreak around the business where the patient works.
These include workers who have been exposed to the general public, such as schools, crowded work environments, and some high-risk retail outlets, and other issues that may require immediate intervention, such as the introduction of high-efficiency air filters for higher risk groups, increasing the air intake rate, introducing physical barriers such as a face mask, and finally installing physical barriers for customer service to ensure proper cleaning and installation of drive-through screens. This includes the provision of management measures for high-risk groups that may be involved in the control of COVID-19, such as providing appropriate training and equipment to workers who are exposed to the virus, providing a comprehensive workplace safety plan to prevent workers from being exposed to the virus, and protecting workers from exposure to the virus by wearing face masks, wearing face masks, and wearing face protection glasses at work, or other workplace hazard precautions, and the use of workplace safety equipment and safety training to prevent or reduce the risk of COVID-19 from spreading to other workplaces.
The workers in this high-risk group are not usually required to use respirators.
The correct controls to properly protect workers and other passengers if someone becomes sick on an aircraft include isolating the sick person 6 feet away from others, assigning a flight attendant to care for the sick person, and giving the sick person a mask when coughing or sneezing, or having the sick person covered his nose and mouth with a tissue.
When handling surfaces or bodily fluids that may be contaminated, or when servicing a sick passenger, flight attendants should wear disposable medical gloves. If possible, flight attendants should wear additional personal protective equipment if they detect signs of fever or persistent coughing or breathing difficulties in a sick passenger.
Handbags and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard protection bags, and surfaces that come in contact with the product should be sanitized and sterilized afterwards. For commercial ships, including pleasure craft, and other passenger ships, risk controls must be implemented, including delaying the voyage when sick, and self-isolation, and immediately notifying the on-board health department if symptoms of fever and other illnesses develop during the voyage.
The quarantine room is the best place to follow up with health care providers.The CDC recommends that schools and child care facilities be closed for a short period of time to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building, regardless of whether the infection is spreading in the community.
Social distancing strategies can be implemented during low to moderate mass infections, such as field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as exercising or singing classes, or eating in a cafe; increasing the space between tables; scheduling to avoid delaying arrival and departure times; limiting non-existent guests; and using separate health smiley locations for children with symptoms of asthma and chronic illness.
In times of high infection rates in local communities, social distancing strategies as well as extended school closures may be considered.The CDC has identified a low near-term health risk for law enforcement officers doing their daily routine.
Law enforcement officials who are likely to be in contact with people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical professionals, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during an emergency, workers should clean and disinfect their joysticks and gears using household sanitation sprays or washing cloths before reuse, and then follow the guidelines for loading and disposal of used PPE and loading and unloading of clothing.
OSHA classifies certain healthcare and breast clinic workers as high-risk or very high exposure category.
High-risk occupations include healthcare provision, logistics, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 cases.
If workers collect or handle contaminants from people known or suspected to have COVID-19 and allow them to disperse particles into the air, this becomes a very, very high risk.
Procedures that release particulate matter into the air include plumbing, cough suppression procedures, airway inspections, certain dental procedures and tests or internal tissue sampling.
High-risk post-mortem work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of patients known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death, if they are at very high risk, including a chest examination.In addition, additional engineering work is performed for these risk groups, including procedures that cause the formation of particulate matter in the air, and control of the isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The special negative pressure ventilation system is suitable for certain health care facilities and cold stations.
Tissue samples must be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newly arrived patients be placed in isolation based on suspected/non-suspected COVID-19 infection.In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends that anyone who is suspected or known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who works within 6 feet of a patient, and who performs procedures such as ventilation by mechanical ventilation, wear respirators.
In the United States, N95 filter mask respirators or better must be NIOSH-approved in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes a fitness test, training, and clinical testing.
Other respirator masks may offer greater protection and make the worker more comfortable. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that spreads through body fluids rather than through the respiratory system, and WHO does not recommend covering everything.
The WHO recommends that personnel who are screened at the entrance use only one surgical mask.
For those collecting respiratory tract tissue samples from COVID-19 patients, caring for or transporting patients, without generating airborne particulates, WHO recommends surgical masks, swimming goggles or masks, suits and gloves.
If a process that produces particles into the air is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirator masks.
The WHO recommends that the use of modern communication technology to provide healthcare (telemedicine) and physical barriers such as glass windows, such as the use of PPE suits worldwide, should be avoided, as only those who are going into the room of a COVID-19 patient with direct contact with the patient should wear the suit; PPE should only be used for necessary work tasks; continuous use of a respirator without wetting while monitoring multiple patients with the same disease; and the need for PPE should be reduced by continuous monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and encouraging non-symptomatic use.

In this month, we discover our own unique circumstances.
The spread of COVID-19 has made our human connection and responsibility to each other across the globe more visible.
We have no tradition for these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on global compassion, collaboration, and community building, which is at the heart of this organization.
The heroic spirit and concern that I have seen among all my colleagues through emails, phone calls and chats is a commendable testament to the humanity with which we are so fortunate to work.
I couldn't be more proud of you.
Last week someone said they were praised for their work.
They are reminding themselves of what it means to change Wikipedia in the world today, and what a powerful signal it is for this important resource to remain online and accessible to all.
Whether you're making a wake-up call at work, whether your colleagues are giving it to you, or whether your community is safe, the work you've done has made it possible.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This moment will have a meaningful impact on the world not only because of what we do but also because of how we do it.
Given the importance of this task and your role in it, we will be making some significant adjustments starting next week to see how we will work together.
The Bible says that "the heart of the wicked one is a snare, and his tongue is a barrier, and the heart of the righteous one is a trap".
As Robyn said earlier, the C-team had discussed their approach and schedule for the next few days and months the night before.
In this talk, they discussed their thoughts on how to best respond to the challenges they face and how to maintain the sustainability of the organization during this time.
Overall, we want to remove stress and make it a contributor to our long-term business goals.
If you need to call back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and all contract workers:
The daily work expectations are 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
They don't call it a day off - if you can work more than the normal hours, the employer can use you.
The world is unpredictable, but our priority is to meet your every need, whether it's to get care for loved ones, to buy groceries, or to see a doctor.
It's not about faking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
The video is a tribute to the victims of the violence.
No sick days or PTO: Talk to your manager and help your team reorganize calendars and schedules to cover key areas of work.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please notify Bryan within T&C Ops so that T&C can help ensure you receive the appropriate attention from support and management.)
Hourly workers will be paid full pay.
As we have said, we are once again determined to honor our contractors and part-time colleagues for our dedication.
Under normal circumstances, everyone is paid based on their normal hours of work.
The letter says you are sick and should not be working.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work to relieve their stress in the bustle of their surroundings.
We are happy to do what we can, especially at a time like this.
It is something you have to take care of yourself.
We ask that you contact your manager so that we can understand what needs to be done and negotiate accordingly.
The Bible says that "the spirit of the world is deceitful, but the flesh is weak".
There are some things we need to continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams (among others) do the critical work of providing the additional support we need.
We will shift our focus to working with all departments to identify current goals and to support what is essential to our business objective.
We have so much to do, and we will all be focused on the more important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt the future.
We are not planning to go twice as fast as we would if we were to get out of the pandemic.
You will no longer need extra time to meet deadlines, which is no longer possible.
We accept that these conditions have changed and will work to set new targets and appropriate timelines.
(Year Round Project) What about APP?
We would like to adjust the time of the 2020-2021 yearly plan to match our new reality and daily work expectations.
Their goal is to propose an extension of their 2019-2020 plan, which allows extra time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize important work, taking care of themselves and taking care of loved ones, while allowing those who want to or are willing to work a reduced schedule in the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule greatly reduces the workloads that are already in preparation and the pressure throughout the organization.
In the next week, they will present their nominations to the board, and once they have their approval, they will update the candidates and the team in the next step.
I would like to thank the APP team for their leadership here.
The office is a place where the office is, where the work is done, and where the work is done.
Last week, one of our partners in San Francisco was found to be a potential case of the COVID-19 virus.
But with so much to consider, we hired a virus-control team to screen all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral products to disinfect not only all surfaces, but also the reception halls and the elevator boards that reach their floors.
The building has a self-care responsibility protocol for the use of materials that support the safety of their tenants.
The office was well prepared and made us feel comfortable when we decided to return.
Their DC office is located in WeWork, where they share their COVID-19 protocol with all DC-based staff.
In line with the guidelines shared by San Francisco, our DC office was upgraded to a fully remote-operated system last week.
As some of our NYC based partners know, we are also consulting on renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but there may be delays.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Their long-term remote colleagues know that this needs to be balanced and want to give you some advice.
Limit the duration of a meeting to no more than an hour or two.
Think about how you would group them over a period of days if you needed longer-term tasks.
Describe the meeting clearly, have a schedule, and send the material to be read in advance.
Post the video in its original format to enable live collaboration and communication with programs like Google Docs and Zoom.
Lead each meeting in a way that is easy to remember: have someone monitor the conversation to ask questions and keep a list of participants, and have someone help take notes or co-write notes.
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Spend your gym money on your dentures.
Join the #remoties line on Slack to chat with your colleagues about remote tasks.
The HR team is looking at a web-based product development environment to support the growth of the activities across the foundation.
This past week, we asked all community organizations that receive funding to suspend public events, such as the Wikimedia-sponsored Editors' Conference, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
They will let them know that they understand that their demands for their cancellation and other restrictions will not allow them to complete their agreed tasks and that no one should be blamed for delaying or changing the objectives.
Next week, we will continue to provide additional guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment among communities around the world is sadness at the disruption, but they feel relieved when they can focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and more.
Moving forward, the CRT is working to build a Meta-Wiki page to allow the public to monitor the impact and follow-up of their and their connections.
Please have experience in COVID-19 related issues.
We are sending out invitations to your calendars for a special staff meeting for the next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share further edits, answer your questions, and spend time with each other to communicate.
We will face it together, and we are ready to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to browse through this email and explore other COVID-19 related unknowns on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will be displaying the latest information on these pages and will make it possible to view all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff living in countries where there is a significant recent outbreak.
If you have a question about travel, events, a major career path or insurance challenges, or any other issue that you need help with, please let the CRT know and work with them.
We are happy to help and communicate as needed.
If you have confidential or non-public information, please email Bryan Juan - Human Resources Director for International Business Operations around the world.
The people of the country are not able to see any of these changes as their job and responsibility.
Instead, it seems that they are now recognized and able to accept their work and responsibilities in a way that they did not in the past.
These are the things we believe in, and these things need to be mutually reinforcing, so that we can continue to work, so that our actions can provide the support they need, and so that we can continue to provide the service they rely on in the world.
The time will come when our planned works will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to support each other and make room for the important work that will take place in the coming weeks and months.
And to achieve this, we need all of you to work, and all of you need to take care of yourselves and your families, and then when your needs arise, that's the best for you.
Now please wash your hands and don't touch your face.
The show is hosted by Kathryn, CRT (Amanda K., Amy V., Bryan J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Jaime V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jaime V., Janeen U., Lisa S., Robyn A., Ryan M., and Toby N.).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is found on the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines (cell membranes).
ACE2 is very useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases as it inhibits the activity of its associated Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) by lowering Angiotensin-II levels and increasing Ang (1-7) levels. ACE2 also acts as an intracellular portal for some coronaviruses.
In humans, the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme-containing chain found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of cells in the lung and other tissues by its enzymatically active domain.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the intracellular domain by another enzyme called sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most parts of the body - ACE2 is mainly found in the cell membranes of lung type II aortic cells, intestinal androsteric cells, arterial and venous membranes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in most parts of the body.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum of the brain, the hypothalamus, which regulates the nervous system and hormones needed by the body, and the cerebral cortex.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counter-regulator to ACE.
ACE binds to angiotensin I and angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels.
ACE2 subsequently cleaved the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe), which was hydrolyzed to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also inhibit several other epidermal receptors, including [des-Arg9]-bradycyanin, epilin, neuron, dinonophene A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transmembrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in Hartnup's disease.
ACE2, a membrane-spanning protein, is one of the receptors that acts as a main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the fusion of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins in the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells can cause the virus and the enzyme to both enter and migrate into the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the host's cyanoproteins TMPRSS2 to modify the S protein, which is currently being studied as a protein therapy. This has led some researchers to speculate that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infections.
However, various academic and regulatory organizations have recommended the continued use of standardised ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and statistical data analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to comparable studies.
"In addition, ""the risk of pneumonia is found to be reduced when treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in patients with stroke and heart disease with an increased risk of pneumonia".
The results are not conclusive for all cases of pneumonia, but the use of ACE inhibitors may also reduce the death rate associated with pneumonia.
A genetically engineered human ACE2 (rhACE2) is being considered as a novel therapy for severe lung damage, and has been shown to improve pulmonary circulation and oxygen saturation in piglets who suffer from sudden acute respiratory infection due to the induction of immunopolysaccharide-stimulating lipopolysaccharide.
The 24-hour duration of effect of a drug week plus the half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of drug effect is 30 minutes.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a potential drug for people who lack resistance to the simple renin-angiotensin system antagonists (RAS antagonists) or for diseases with elevated circulating angiotensin II. Mixed rhACE2 has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to enable contact tracing, i.e. identifying people who have been in contact with infected persons ("contacts"), in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic".
In some territories and jurisdictions, a large number of applications have been developed or proposed with the support of official government.
We've created a lot of infrastructure to develop touch-trace apps.
In particular, privacy concerns have been raised about systems that track the geolocation of app users.
Other methods that are less intrusive include using Bluetooth waves to record the distance between the user and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be integrating the Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has developed an app that links to Alipay to allow citizens to check for exposure to COVID-19 patients.
The app is already used in more than 200 cities in China.
The app was developed by a local community of IT experts and will be made available for free and handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-based app StopKorona! was launched to help track infections and contacts and help healthcare authorities respond quickly.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"The government announced on 12 April that development of an exposure-tracking app is in the final stages and will be launched in a few weeks. A similar app is being developed in Ireland and France ("CoVirus")."
Australia and New Zealand are both considering developing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol, while Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure COVID-19 patients in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed practical problems that can occur with application-based systems, including inefficiency and error authentication if only a small percentage of the population uses the app.
"To address concerns about the spread of 'misleading or dangerous' 'coronavirus' apps, Apple has restricted the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, and only 'legitimate' or otherwise reputable organizations can do so".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Personal data security campaigners have expressed concern about the consequences of mass quarantining of populations using coronavirus apps, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created for coronavirus pandemic surveillance will be removed once the infection is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The eight conditions for government projects have been announced by the organizations.
The surveillance must be  formal,  proportionate,  proportionate.
Extensions of the period of quarantine shall include statutory provisions that automatically terminate after a specified period.
The use of information will be limited to COVID-19 purposes.
The data security and anonymity must be protected, and evidence-based protection must be guaranteed.
Digital surveillance must work to prevent discrimination and marginalization from becoming more serious.
Sharing information with external entities and individuals must be regulated by law.
The law must protect against torture and the right of citizens to respond to torture.
"The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published a list of actions to be taken by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups".
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking system from their device operating systems and eliminating its need.
Some countries have adopted network-based location tracking instead of apps to remove the need to download apps and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been confirmed.
The Internet-based solutions that access location data sets have significant privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers require the retrieval of individual location data. Several systems have been created that retain personal data that is used only for interface communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts and infected people.
Instead of using a specific app, the system collects data from various sources, including mobile devices and card payment data, and synthesizes it to send alerts to potential infected people via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts of an infected person, the government has made location information publicly available, and several changes to the information security law since the MERS outbreak in the country have allowed this to be done.
This information is publicly available on many apps and websites. Many countries, including Germany, have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Touch tracking, which protects the security of personal data, is a concept that has been supported by a comprehensive body of research papers developed since at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, several expert groups are working on appropriate solutions for personal data security, such as using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to record user's interactions with other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a mediation effort involving both centralization and decentralization methods, not a single process. The decentralized process methods include contact tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), and other security-critical processes and systems (PACT) for mobile communication tracing of personal data.
In these procedures, the authentication of self-certification data will only occur within the device and never reaches the outside of the device.
A separate team at the MIT Media Lab is implementing SafePaths, a platform that allows for the use of proprietary algorithms when collecting location or routing data to slow the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a document published in March 2020 titled "Maintaining Privacy Information Security During an Apps Gone Rogue Epidemic". Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform from Enigma MPC, a company that originally started at the MIT Media Lab, which develops privacy information security technologies.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share critical location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of their data.
The Global TCN Coalition was established on April 5, 2020, by groups that have come together with a fundamentally similar approach and almost identical practices, with the goal of reducing diversity and developing globally collaborative tracking and alerting applications that play a key role in achieving broad consensus.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, used in its official government app, freely accessible.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the controllers of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a method for touch tracking, which they claimed would protect the security of personal data by combining Bluetooth low-power technology and encryption/reading to protect personal data.
They also published details of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be officially launched in three steps:
Tools introduced to enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect personal data
In order to integrate the app directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple first released the app through the operating system update, and then removed the threat in a similar way to the way the system is currently being dealt with by the ongoing surveillance issues.
Drug re-purposing (also known as drug re-purposing, drug recall, drug re-purposing, or drug therapy re-purposing) is the re-purposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition that is different from the one that was originally prescribed.
It is the subject of ongoing scientific research to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and transfusion of plasma from patients recovering from the disease. SARS-CoV-2 contains 66 therapeutic proteins, each with multiple sites of molecular synthesis.
Analysis of these interferon sites supports the project of the targeted effect, which is developing an effective antibiotic to fight COVID-19 proteins.
The most important proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 are the papyan-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphate.

A study of lopinavir, a combination of the antibiotic-related retrovirus killer (lopinavir) /HIV/AIDS treatment (ritonavir) (Kelterra) concluded that "no benefit was found".
Drugs have been developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is working to improve drugs to identify compounds that can bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is debate within the scientific community over the sources that may have led to the re-targeting of drugs specifically formulated for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included the retrovirus-preventing drug (lopinavir) /HIV/AIDS treatment (ritonavir) in an international combination trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections.Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir could be used in the philo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronavirus-control processes.
One case of viral sterilization is the development of immunity through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and spread of infection.
Some early clinical trials suggesting that there may be a significant genetic barrier to immunity exist.There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two for patients with moderate illness and one for those with more severe illness, both conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals.
There are currently three drug trials with vitamin C supplements for people with severe COVID-19 hospitalized, two with placebo (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).

The anti-IL-6 receiver has been confirmed by China.
Also see the trials in Italy and China, and Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a potential vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has yet passed clinical trials, there are several attempts underway to develop a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it expected a vaccine that would eliminate the virus that causes SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccines in Phase I safety studies.
The disease was first diagnosed in December 2019.
The main outbreak spread globally in 2020, leading to significant investment and exploratory activities to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published cloning materials to develop a potential vaccine that could defeat SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI announced that it was taking a critical step forward in vaccine manufacturing with speed, capacity, scale, and availability around the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that there were 10 different technology platforms in the early 2020s to explore and implement to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that have progressed to Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (stage I agent and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral expression (stage I promoter and vaccine-designated drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 expression)
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 new drugs are already in the early stages of development, with 78 active confirmed projects (79 according to Milken University) and 37 projects that have had little public disclosure (considered to be in the planning or design phase) but have been announced.
More specifically, when determining which drugs are more effective, Phase I-II trials involve preliminary safety and clinical testing, including randomized controlled trials of ineffective placebo and multiple sites.
The optimal dose includes more participants, including a control group in phase III trials to monitor adverse effects, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines currently in development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (preliminary trials/research).
On or around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was exploring the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify the proteins of the virus to induce an immune response.
In Canada, on January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center at the University of Saskatchewan (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it had begun work on the development of a vaccine, which is targeted to begin human trials in 2021.
The vaccine production projects were announced on 26 January 2020 at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and on 28 January at the University of Hong Kong.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Co., headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.

On or around March 10, 2020, the company Emergent Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax Inc.
In the development of vaccines.
The research partners also continued to publish plans for a preclinical trial and Phase I clinical trial to be conducted in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 independent organizations and that it will take between one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine, if only it can be done as quickly as possible.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it had created a particle similar to the coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine is in laboratory trials with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac a "substantial amount" to secure the availability of Covid-19 vaccines, which the German government had refused.
On 17 March 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced its partnership with German company BioNTech to co-develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently in pre-clinical trials related to clinical trials, the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162 was expected to launch in April 2020.
In Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced on 17 March 2020 that their preliminary clinical trial results would be available in April 2020 and that their final vaccine trial on humans could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research team, which includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.The total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine has reached US$29 million.
Other CEPI investments in COVID-19 response include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started testing six different vaccines on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing their own self-adjusted RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed in 14 days after the Chinese case was received.
In late March, the Canadian government announced that it would spend $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical approaches to fighting COVID-19, including the development of new vaccines at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced that it would spend $192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to build a national vaccine bank with new vaccines to use in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine on mice, PittCoVacc, and reported that MNA had provided a SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine that could produce a possible pathogenic antibiotic-specific vaccine that became evident 2 weeks after vaccination [in mice].
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Medicine announced that they were developing a new DNA-based vaccine that can be administered by nasal injection.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA is engineered to multiply inside the human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles that stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that can fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, three US government, industry, and universities combined resources with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Current vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early research evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of COVID-19 using isolated animal models such as ACE2-clown mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates has shown that international collaboration is required to develop biosecurity-level 3 containment approaches and standardized security procedures to manage live viruses.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or pre-vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to investigative papers published in 2005 and 2006, the isolation and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a top priority for governments and public health agencies around the world, while there is no approved vaccine against MERS.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was believed that current SARS research could be useful in finding vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine completed its Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in clinical trials, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines: two adenoviral-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID-19 is already known and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents documented through various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic effects and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and stomach, and nausea.
The time between exposure and symptomatic onset is usually around five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
Most patients experience mild symptoms, but some develop pneumonia and multiple organ damage caused by the virus.
As of 17 April 2020, 2.24 million infections and over 153,000 deaths have been reported in 210 countries and territories.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is transmitted between people, mainly through close contact, often through small droplets released by coughing, sneezing or talking.
The particles that are released when we exhale are usually not very contagious and tend to travel long distances, but they do fall on the ground or on surfaces.
Many people can become infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching a surface that is infected with the virus.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The period of the first three days after the onset of symptoms is the most contagious, although there is a risk of infection in the pre-symptomatic and later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal tract.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Some authorities recommend against the use of masks, some recommend the use of masks, and others recommend that countries use them, with varying recommendations for the use of masks by the general public.
Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 against a specific virus.
Local infections have been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, shock, difficulty in waking up, and bruising of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, sneezing, or sore throat may also be observed.
The study found that the percentage of people with gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, varied.
In China, some patients initially showed only convulsions and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, organ damage, and death.
It's called the "birth cycle".
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days after infection.Reports indicate that all infected people are asymptomatic.
The role of asymptomatic people in the spread of the disease is not fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may be contributing to the spread of the disease.
It is currently unknown what proportion of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, and is still being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases did not show symptoms during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began adding asymptomatic people to the daily patient list on 1 April, when 130 (78%) of 166 infected people were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucous membranes and saliva and dental fluids carry large amounts of the virus.
The Bible says: "The tongue of the righteous one is like a fire shut up in the mouth of the wicked one".
In a Singapore study, unprotected coughing was reported to cause the droplet to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually found in airborne particles, the National Academy of Sciences has identified RNA of the virus in air samples from collectors installed along the corridor outside a public room, possibly in the form of biological airborne infections.
Medical procedures such as airway implants and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) cause respiratory secretions to become fine particles floating in the air, causing airborne transmission.
This risk is low when there is a possibility of infection through feces. The virus is most contagious during the symptomatic phase, when infections can occur before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.
Although it is not yet clear how the disease is transmitted, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that a person can usually transmit the disease to two to three other people, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours to a few days.
Specifically, the virus has been found to survive on cotton and paper for up to a day, on plastic (molded plastic (polypropylene)) and steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, it varies with humidity and temperature.
When used properly, soaps and disinfectants are also effective, as soap-related products not only break down the fatty membrane of the virus, rendering it inactivated, but also rendering it inert on the skin and other surfaces.
Other fluids, such as benzoyl chloride and clorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antibiotic), are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were collected two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six cases, the first sample showed the highest viral concentration, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral concentration on day two of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that first emerged in isolation from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory syndrome in the Wuhan community.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus also occur in the naturally occurring related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by bursting a protective water bottle with household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the virus enters the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most commonly found in type 2 ABLA cells in the lungs.
The virus binds to ACE2 and uses a special surface glycoprotein called a papilloma to enter the host cell.
In Wuhan, China, sudden cardiac arrest is seen in 12% of those hospitalized with the virus, and is more common in more severe cases.
There is a high incidence of cardiovascular symptoms due to inflammatory response and immune system deficiencies during progression, but severe cardiovascular damage may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are found in high concentrations in the heart and are involved in cardiac functions.
High incidence of venous thrombosis (31%) and blood clot obstruction (25%) in the arteries were observed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 infection and may be due to poor prognosis.Meta-examinations of those who died from COVID-19 showed extensive AV damage (DAD) and lesion infiltration involving lymphocytes in the lungs.
SARS-COV-2 has a change of direction for the respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE2, but patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of skin rashes throughout the body.
The pathogenic GM-CSF-permeable T cells in particular have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6-permeable monocytes and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
In the trials, infiltration of the stem cells was also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed with respiratory samples obtained by nasal and throat radiographs, but nasal radiographs or saliva samples may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require blood samples to be taken every two weeks, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists isolated the genome of the coronavirus and published its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral infection.
As of April 4, 2020, the antibody test (which can test for current infectious disease and previously infected) had been developed but was not widely available.
Chinese experience with the test has shown an accuracy of only 60% to 70%.
The US FDA approved the first point-of-care test for use by the end of the month on 21 March 2020. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest diagnostic methods based on clinical indications and epidemiological risks.
Asymmetrical spread of the dorsal fin, with small fragments of glass scattered across the lungs, and opaque forms of cells are common in early infections.
As the disease progresses, it can cause lung epithelial thickening, surface roughness (thickening of the interphalangeal space with irregular dental fillings) and clots.
There is limited information available on the causes of microscopic injuries and the physiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in breast exams are:
The first is the fact that the disease is not a disease of the lungs, but rather a disease of the heart.
Four severities of viral pneumonia can be investigated:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary infiltration, proliferation of large and abnormally large pneumocytes, infiltration of lymphocytes, and formation of large cells with multiple nucleases and mediastinal inflammation.
The disease is caused by a combination of the bacterial and viral infections that cause the disease.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Healing from pneumonia: secretions from the aviola tract and formation of pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: vascular clot propagation (DIC), the human chorionic platelet response
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and that the inside of the elbow be used when tissue is not available.
The article also recommends that you wash your hands thoroughly after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public places, partly to limit infection from asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing exposure of infected people to large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The social distancing guidelines also require people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from each other.
There is no known effective drug to prevent COVID-19 and as a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the high rate of infection, called "strain curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are too dirty, before eating and after snapping, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are readily available.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores. It is not an active ingredient for the disinfection of the skin.
The water is then mixed with glycerin to make a moisturizer.
The patients are managed through supportive care and other vital organ support, which includes fluid therapy, oxygenation and other supportive services.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a conventional face mask.
The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to treat respiratory failure is still being considered, but its benefits are still being considered.
To boost your immune system, you must practice personal hygiene, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and eat a healthy diet.
Supportive care may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care and treatment of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Emergency physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various healthcare institutions into an open source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptomatic treatment, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in healthcare settings where procedures such as intubation or hand-squeezed respirators are used to pump out air particles.
For healthcare professionals who are caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends following standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne particulate precautions, as well as patient care in the AIIR.
Recommended equipment: PPE, respirator or mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Where available, use respirators (instead of face masks) as a priority.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of masks with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Although they are designed to protect against particulate matter such as dust in the air, their effectiveness on a particular biological agent is not guaranteed for uses not indicated on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends wearing face coverings and the use of a final sleep mask.
Most people infected with COVID-19 are not so severely ill that they require a respirator or similar device.
A type of respiratory support for people with respiratory problems associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied for many people in hospital, and some evidence suggests that it may avoid pneumonia by using a well-flowing nasal tube or a two-stage extra-aortic pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two types of drugs leads to the same benefits for critically ill patients.
Compared to a nasal line with high airflow, some doctors prefer to live with a mechanical ventilator that is invasive if possible, because this method limits the spread of fine particles in the air. Severe cases are more common in older people (especially those over 60 and especially those over 80).
In many developed countries, the capacity of the health system to deal with a sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 cases with severe hospitalization is limited, and there are not enough hospital beds for each person.
A Chinese study found that 5% had to be admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people with COVID-19 in hospital are gradually admitted to the ICU.
COVID-19 causes sudden respiratory syndrome, which makes it more difficult to get oxygen, and complicates mechanical respiration.
Respirators and high PEEP are needed to be able to perform the required pressure controls to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respirator-associated lung damage and pulmonary-thoracic air leakage.
The use of a new respirator is not recommended, and it is not recommended to use a new respirator.
The exploration of potential treatments began in January 2020, and drugs to fight a wide range of pathogens are being tested in clinical trials.
Ramdisiva is the most promising.
Although it may take until 2021 for a new drug to appear, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses and are undergoing advanced trials.
In severe cases, antiviral drugs may be tried.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials to test the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has provisionally approved the use of healthy blood plasma as an experimental treatment when a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
The clinical studies needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy for the disease have not been done.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users must provide their name and ID number.
The app uses surveillance data to investigate possible close contacts and potential risk of transmission.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation when a risk is detected, but also alerts local health officials. In South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, mobile phone big data analysis, facial recognition, mobile phone tracking and memory technology are used to identify those who are infected and those who have been in contact with them.
In March 2020, Israeli government security agencies were able to monitor cell phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
Measures are being taken to strengthen the quarantine and to protect those who may have been in contact with the infected people.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared its collected phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, an agency of the German federal government, to conduct research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect people who break the lockdown.
Giulio Gallera, the Italian regional health commissioner, says that mobile phone companies have told him that 40% of people are mobile in some way.
The German government organized a 48-hour hacking competition on Saturday and Sunday with more than 42,000 participants.
Meanwhile, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has urged the world to create solutions to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
Many people may fear the risk of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or infection.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Social isolation, isolation, health anxiety, stress and the recession are a perfect storm that is putting people's mental health and well-being at risk".
The disease may be mild, with few or no symptoms, and similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as colds.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or chronic disease may take three to six weeks to recover.
Data from other viruses with similar strains, such as SARS and MERS, suggest that pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.However, there is no data for COVID-19 infection.In some people, COVID-19 infection affects the lungs and causes pneumonia.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory infectious disease (ARDS), which can cause shortness of breath, blood clots, or multiple organ failure.
Newly emerging diseases associated with COVID-19 include blood poisoning, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, especially increased plasma plasma time (clotting time), were found in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was found in 4% of this group.
It is estimated that 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, in patients transferred to the ICU, there is an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In studies of early cases, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death ranged from six days to 41 days at a rate of 14 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, compared to 1.7% for women.
Tissue pathology tests of pulmonary cardiology have shown extensive evidence of AVola damage with fibromyzoid secretions from cells in both lungs.
Viral intracellular mutations have been detected in lung cells.
The lung imaging is similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
The National Health Commission of China reports that heart damage, such as high troponin levels or heart failure, accounts for 11.8% of the deaths.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of hospitalizations are positive. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomy of a region also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of the incidence of deaths vary due to regional variations, but also due to technical difficulties.
Ignoring the benign process can lead to a higher than predicted mortality rate.
However, the fact that the outcome for previously infected people is death may suggest that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and 2.4 times more likely to receive intensive care and die.There are also concerns about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital authorities have reported a decline in lung function from 20% to 30% in patients recovering from the disease, and scans of the lungs indicate organ damage.
It can also cause a syndrome that is treated in intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether the previous infection has had a chronic effect on those who have recovered from the disease.
While resistance to disease may be possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, it has been reported that in cases of recovery from COVID-19 infection, they are later positive in coronavirus testing.
In these cases, the survival of the infection is worse than the re-infection.
The virus may be naturally occurring and may have evolved through animal sources.
The true origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the infection was almost entirely human-to-human.
The study, published in The Lancet in January 2020, identified the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients as having the earliest onset of symptoms on December 1, 2019.
The earliest date of onset of symptoms in officially published letters from the WHO is reported as 8 December 2019.
Different measures are commonly used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and duration, and also depend on the number of tests, quality of healthcare, treatment options, when the initial outbreak began, and other characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
In the WHO's coding for emergency ICD-10 infections after 2019, deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections are designated as U07.1, and deaths from clinical tests for SARS-CoV-2 that do not include laboratory-confirmed or epidemiological tests that do not include epidemiological tests are designated as U07.2. The patient-to-disease ratio is the number of patients tested divided by the number of deaths in a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality rate as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Figures vary by region. Other measures include infectious mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of the population that is infected with the disease and dies from the disease, and infectious disease mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who are infected (infected and non-infected) with the disease.
The statistics are not time-bound, but rather tracking the exact number of people infected through the intensity of the process.
While not all infected people have antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have already been infected.
Castiglione d'Adda, a small rural village in Italy, is the epicentre of the infection, with 80 deaths (1.7%) out of a population of 4,600.
The outbreak at the carnival parade in Gangelt, which was passed on to young people, resulted in relatively few deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is not yet fully functional.
In the Netherlands, it is estimated that about 3% of the donated blood may have antibodies.
69 people died from COVID-19 (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate differ between men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The difference between men and women at the end of life is only 90%, and the highest risk for men is men in their 50s.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of the six variations is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Gender-based immune differences, lower smoking rates, and a higher risk of co-morbidities such as high blood pressure in younger men than in women, all contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of cases are men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths are men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked data on the sex of COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Health workers, especially nurses, have a higher percentage of women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be COVID-19.
WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus, VI refers to the virus, D to the disease, and 19 to the date of 31 December 2019.
In an effort to prevent blame from being placed on the virus, the name was chosen in accordance with international recommendations, without reference to the relevant geographical location (e.g. China), animal species, or population groups.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the terms COVID-19 virus and virus that causes COVID-19 in public relations.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV Critical Respiratory Disease as intermediate names for the virus and disease in line with 2015 guidance against the use of disease sites and virus names.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the regular supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare devices such as nasal swabs and respirators.
In one example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed a ventilator valve, the equipment manufacturer was unable to deliver in the time required, and a small local business counterproduced and now made 100 needed valves overnight.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake news have emerged and spread rapidly online regarding the origin, spread, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease.
Humans may be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral outbreaks in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a combined trial to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing antimicrobial compounds that it believed to be the most effective.
Although no vaccine is available, various agencies are actively promoting vaccination efforts.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells, which is the function of the previous SARS-CoV.
Three vaccine strategies are being tested.
For the first time, researchers are working to create a vaccine against the virus.
The use of an inactive or dead virus is intended to accelerate the immune response of the human body to new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, vaccines made from antibodies to the pathogen, aims to create a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to fight back against some of the virus's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV-2 infected people, the research focuses on the S-binding protein, which helps the virus to bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines, DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel method for developing vaccines.
The experimental vaccines produced by these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy.The first vaccine trial with four volunteers began on 16 March 2020 in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code that has been copied from the pathogenic virus.Antibody-dependent immunogenicity has been suggested as a possible challenge in vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are reportedly over 300 ongoing clinical trials.
Many of the trials looked at approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
A report published in late April showed that many countries were involved in nine phase 3 trials of ramdesivir, a retargeted antiviral drug that is involved in most of the research in China.
The ongoing review of clinical development for a COVID-19 vaccine and treatment began in April 2020. A number of current antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are under study, including ramdizevar, chloroquine, and hydrochlorothiazide, lopinavir/totoinavir, and lopinavir/totoinavir, and interferon beta.
Evidence for the efficacy of Ramdesivir is expected to emerge in March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with ramdesivir, which has not been confirmed.
Phase 3 trials are underway in the United States, Italy, and China.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
Korean and Chinese health officials have endorsed the use of chloroquine.
The recommended daily intake is 1 gram, but Wuhan Virology notes that twice that amount is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine with the consent of physicians treating people with COVID-19.The seventh Chinese guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin, or umimicinovir in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that large doses of antiviral drugs are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus in the test tube.
Nitrozanoid has been recommended for further in vitro studies after demonstrating low concentration limitation of SARS-CoV-2. Complete membrane protein serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the ACE2 receptor and receptor.
Studies on chlorine and hydroxychloroquine, with or without acetaminophen, have had major limitations that have prevented the medical community from pursuing these therapies without further study.It is not known what role OTM has in the treatment of COVID-19 without also blocking SARS-CoV-2 externally.
In severe post-COVID-19 stages, it is often followed by a cytoarchitectal response, called a cytokine response.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have anti-cytocin-activation properties.Tocilizumab was added to the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
Italy is conducting nationwide Phase 2 non-clinical trials after patients with severe disease have been found to be positive for the virus.
The new test is designed to detect cytokine spike (a symptom of reaction-induced wasting) in combination with a plasma-removing blood test, which is thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved an anti-interleukin-6 receptor drug based on case studies for the symptomatic treatment of uncontrolled cytokine-producing disorders, and for the treatment of CAR T cell therapy, which occurs for different reasons.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tosalizolamb is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified, lean antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 survivors to those who need them is being investigated as a way to achieve automatic immunity without vaccination.
This strategy was tested for SARS and had mixed results.
Viral attenuation is an anticipated function as the antibody therapy that is used to treat the disease may be linked to the fight against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytokinesis and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other forms of automatic antibody therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are being developed and tested.
The production of the Nalan platelet, which contains specific antibodies to the virus, will be increased for more rapid practical application by recovering patients.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who contracted COVID-19 and later died after raising awareness of the virus' spread.
