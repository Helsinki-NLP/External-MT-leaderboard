Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it also offers details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brown-brown on top with a light-coloured or carotenoid background.
The find also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed tail, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - beards and whiskers - researchers infer that the rachis was probably a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but to regulate temperature or to exhibit. Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen presents the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage, not feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They discovered that the Sun worked under the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system depended on their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.
Some television reports show white smoke rising from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant not to go outside, turn off the air conditioning and not to drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high fatality rate".
Some patients may have picked up the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts over a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still seems to be low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

The government has also promised many millions of vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Vaccine delivery forecasts for the historically hardest hit areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funding and low prioritization of other diseases.

The infrared images show day and night temperature variations which show that these are probably caves.
They are colder than the surface surrounding them during the day, and hotter during the night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep clots in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a not-so-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can be witnesses that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added to them other than those of the voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the procedure, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and computer".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalised at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Scottish Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
He's in custody pending charges and trial, but any visual evidence could be rejected because his image has been posted everywhere.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown office, the prosecutor, has indicated to journalists that they will not make any further statements, at least until the sentencing.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to settle according to the pre-war borders of the Middle East in 1967.
Other issues reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley dispute.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accept it for five years.
Hunters in the supplemental pest control pilot trial had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, as the pilot trial was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sports Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Park's Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received proper security training and training.
Yesterday Martelly took the oath of office of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former Provisional Electoral Council be dismissed as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company termed "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report an "unfortunate miscalculation".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has said there have been no reports of damage in the nation.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman has held Hong Kong tourists hostage for hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, have recently been released.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Hospital for Women in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the infant.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black bag' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was as freaky as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll find her at the altar...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the poll's extremes, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question by his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication necessary to endure his pain because it's forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since some comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is speculated to be running in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old technology based on ground-based radar so that traffic controllers can locate pilots with much more accuracy and send them more accurate information.
There is no provision for increased transport and no surface trains will stop at Wembley; there are also no car parks or link car parks on foot.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have led to the possibility that the match will be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that it took much longer for this process, due to the crossing of a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a Galápagos finch of conical beak, Geospiza conirostris (outside).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into smaller figures.
It can be inserted into thin wires, which can be twisted and bent, and it can be beaten or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very fine and stacked on other metals, so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using the juice of the Lombardy cabbage.
The colour of col lombard juice changes according to whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the analyzed substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet clean hands, make a ball.
The humidity in the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewerage have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, bathhouses were part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered in joint company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back again, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most remarkable thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much faster and easier.
We have been transported by train, by car, and by many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including wild-caught domestic cats) that eat the small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called bands.
The herds are formed by one to three related adult males together with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are often closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion bands behave largely like wolf packs or wolf packs, which are animals with a behavior surprisingly similar to lions (although not other large felids) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the force of a forcible human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-voiced roar, but rather like a phrase shouted from the words of a naive.
The bird likes to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals he hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists believe that the birds follow and find the animals that eat (prey) with the smell, summing up the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The birds hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then flying over their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, crossing a mountain range or a river, or migrate to a new island and cannot return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants, and most of what we eat is plants, and without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had over seventy sharp teeth like knives, accompanied by an additional mouth-shaped game, so that there was no escape route for anything that got in their way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other biting animals, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could compete with it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of rare or unusual items at their banquets, such as boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called lyreons.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate seated on a stool, the rich men liked to participate in banquets where they would huddle together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that had come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built to each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the chaplains tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary which only the chaplains could access.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not as important.
Most Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple open counters facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder, and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it.
Well, despite its discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, there's a treasure map written.
Now, that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the document, lower down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its creation the long parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it seems that the notation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by Vichy France, Frenchmen who had signed the peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations in the strict sense of the term.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as their sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, as there was no national executive or judicial, it fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
Articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended and the states took over the central government so lightly that their representatives often abstained.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and have the presence of Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipel".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and used Chinese laborers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame size in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the era of analog films.
It still occurs today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital image cameras' sensors.
The 35 mm format does create a bit of confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate the suffering and poverty of the poor and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The church's main authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean segments, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical eras: each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was a period of unstable divided provinces, the most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which took place during the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many of the nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Similarly after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied for them allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This applies to the military as well, because instead of basing the army's ranks on classes, from this moment on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a deep interest in matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even knowing it exists, it's not easy to find.
There is nothing to be seen but a beautiful serene sky above, and the abundant mountains surrounding it, and there is very little of this world that can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward bow" sign resembles the letter V (see lower) and the "downward bow" looks like a grape or square without the underside.
When it appears upwards it means that you have to start from the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it is downwards it means that you have to start from the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow downwards.
Rubbing the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while doing it the other way around produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Feel free to write down your own indications, but keep in mind that the bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and babbled threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows fully open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles to the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, thus bearing a large part of the expenses and interest of the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The time in which the events take place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Croats had returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital left Constantinople for Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles could arrive in the West 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the practice of producing enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses native stored seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of the factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Some of these children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all by themselves.
The feral child, when raised solely by nonhuman animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The bastide theory is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The scaffold can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the small Microsoft Office assistant clip.
Virtual bastions are internalised in software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are put into foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of safety for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The host is supposed to grant all the needs that were not covered in the home from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet take it to additional dimensions in terms of its focus on uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these interpretative capacities of human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variation heritage that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the back and forth variation between the two genetic backgrounds in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to get would have been the proteins that leaves and vegetables provide us with, but unless they're cooked, these are hard to digest for primates like us humans.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" as the chimpanzees of the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up in a posture during the normal period of sleep and falling back to sleep after a short period (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a low-noise alarm clock that makes you aware but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you are one of those who restart your watch while you sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room so that you have to take it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is correlated in an opposite way to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present.
Anyone can reach enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
It spanned the next 40 years and was fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defences had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Contemporarily, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy disposal of milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other grazing areas, often watched over by herders who were usually children or teenagers. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they were used by horse-drawn wagons to achieve higher speeds and to carry larger loads over the most difficult sections.
The crossbows were introduced early on to hold the weirs in place, but it was soon seen that the weirs would be more efficient if they had an iron covering over them.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright in the usual way.
Bipedal specializations have been found in austrolyte fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes may have walked on two legs at all length 7 million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help reduce some of the suffering that might exist in the future.
This works as a symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been increased by overpopulation and extravagant human life-styles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap's flyers".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and that another is alive.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and hooves, they lay eggs and they walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus would.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific venom on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with the shrews, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both redwoods and shrubs are nest-dwellers, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific research.
Now, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the virus' DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus' protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits and ecosystem information study.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplace and pass alongside others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this enormous coal economy has unleashed one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail daily? Is it that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of the driver with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have a considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) horsepower, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the spiadimony and the ephemerides.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
There were people who thought what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because we don't have the sense that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
There is knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as they can all be discovered in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although according to his theory they also changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms would fit inside the last dot of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
Today, you can write messages on computer screens without ever needing a small sharpening machine.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The fission pump works on the principle that it takes energy to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy wheelbarrow upside down, separating the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break up with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust.
The bark measures 70 km thick at the nearest part and 100 km at the farthest part.
It is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar mars on the visible side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized so that they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can appear as administrators begin to lead their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is to try to continue as "just another guy" (or girl).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary action, carrying out assessments, assigning responsibilities, and making others responsible for their actions.
In the opposite case, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that you have to change everything that the team has been doing and make it your own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often ends in arguments between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual equipment is subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional equipment, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that the local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member addresses. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, an organization's joint work to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to customer need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous approximation as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and so it narrows the area of inquiry and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It's been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been built into various home computer applications and video games.
Thematic outings are an important part of any classroom. Very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with prospective students.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a memorial book.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills, although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this often changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog began to make an effort to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be more astute with the world around them".[32] The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; they can define their own positions in the context of which others write and also highlight their own perspectives on concrete issues by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all of these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the Canadian city par excellence.
The population of the great northern ranges is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wildlands.
To make a comparison of populations that is often surprising, there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by a wide margin, and a continent in itself as far as wildlife is concerned.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and made a great way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe Route to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be chased, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazonian fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benimerians as a strategic port, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, terrissa, leather goods, nargils, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the downtown.
Although Goma is considered safe, it is worthwhile to investigate before making any visit outside this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the special program "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than African feel.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one witnessing diverse wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is considered the benchmark of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee is payable.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a selection of South African parks, or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main hub.
The set of buildings that make up the urban skyline of Hong Kong has been related to a bright bar chart that is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side of the Kowloon Waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on land gained from the sea along the north coast.
This is the place where the British colonists occupied, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of coastal mangrove, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stops of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now has 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tigers.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Panakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs are expected to be cleared.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), with a value set equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
On the outer islands credit cards are probably not accepted, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you have to make do of going.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less unchanging throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife!
As docile as it may seem, buffalo, woodpeckers, ants, bones, and almost any large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bones and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Beaches are plentiful, as Auckland is a two-port city, with the most popular ones situated in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have shade thanks to pohutukawa trees.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family beaches filled with a good range of shops along the coast.
The best known local beer is the "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
You can drink a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines don't quite tolerate travel.
It is safe to drink water from the local tap, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a carlat is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso coffee, the cappuccino comes well laden with cream (without foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate chip is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year many trips to the reef are made and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, he follows the recommendations of the authorities, he respects all the signs and pays close attention to safety warnings.
Cubozoos are found near river banks and estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and shy away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not make active ocean life; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations give travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport shuttle or even combined flight and hotel packages.
You can keep the reservation if you also need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any requests or suggestions should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp outright, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll want to get there early enough to get a campground near the music.
It should be remembered that even if the music has ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, because crossing the ice creates a terrible noise in the hardest hit.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include a time in the city, and passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money their visitors spend in the casino.
They often have special food, drinks and entertainment offerings to cheer the guests and keep them from leaving the establishment.
Some bars serve alcohol in the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive on them as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or wind-swept snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without many interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most relevant to many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy, which is why you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "rural walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") is a type of hiking activity that can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket for about ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have ironing tables and ironing machines, even if there are no ironing tables in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not like to wear your socks on, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, shock).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it may take a few minutes.
Effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and if you have concerns you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not familiar to them in their home regions.
Plagues can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of forcibly injuring or killing people, are not usually considered plagues.
Duty free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers bound to countries with high taxation can sometimes save themselves a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and closed curves are common.
The speed limits indicated are notably lower than those of other front and rear sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to the limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Curiously, though, the cell phone service is more powerful here than in many other sections of the trail, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good and Bavarian pastry is very, very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Fruit pies are common, with apples baked into the pies all year round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also carry almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits. The most well-known pastissos often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but tasty meals, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is in common use.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the food native to the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find all over the archipelago and offers a wide variety of dishes seasoned with simple flavours.
The stirrups are supports for the legs of the rider that hang from either side of the saddle.
They are more stable by the gene, but can present safety problems because the gene's feet could get trapped in them.
If a horse jumps from a horse but has one foot stuck to the stirrup, it could be dragged if the horse runs away.
For starters, most genets wear mounting boots with a taco and a single coat and very thin.
In addition, some saddles, particularly the English saddles, have safety bars that allow the steppe leather to fall off the frame if a horse pulls it backwards in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also called the Yosemite of South America, boasts many large granite walls and cliffs.

Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a surfboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old - there are rock paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, but it was not until 1861 that Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called skiing, ski tourism or ski excursionism.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter performed on rough terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something like a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat longer distances than walking - though you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speed without a heavy backpack on flat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling between different countries would involve many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a single country in this respect.
While you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographic differences, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Crafts products can be classified as antiques, although they are more recent than other similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other trades.
Even in tradition, however, not all Sami have been related to reindeer breeding on a large scale, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, holding reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.

If the country you are visiting is subject to a traffic alert, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may be interested to hear the recommendations of governments other than your own, but their recommendations are for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The considerations presented are often brief, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur all over the world, and there are different classes that can occur depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, squalls, excessive rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe atmospheric phenomena are turbulence, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travelers be aware of any adverse weather risks affecting their area as it could alter their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the problems that have been covered here in greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aiders and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo sex change surgery in another country should ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports where no gender is specified (X) or updated documents to show the desired name or gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents can vary widely.

Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns after the waves have collided with the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper stations, and a strong current can be formed there towards deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim backwards against the current, which can be impossible.
So good point of departure from the current, swimming backwards is no harder than usual.
You'd better head somewhere where you won't be captured again or, depending on your skills or if you've been briefed, you may want to wait for a rescue.
The return shock comes before the culture shock (with a smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture often have a particularly hard time adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first moved to a foreign land, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Sometimes you don't realize that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.

Scenes from the story are shown on the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains here merge to form a plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m (16,060 ft) of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as one must be outside with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is usually used on boats, including recreational vessels, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among people who are considering a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among undergraduates, giving them the option to take a year off before starting college, without compromising their education.

Typically there will be enrollment fees to sign up for these educational programs.
Finland is an important shipping destination, and the 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's also quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises make an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic city centre using a couple of full days sleeping back on the night boat.
If you only land with excursions on board, you do not need an independent visa (dated 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or if they have suffered a traumatic experience.

Courier companies charge well for delivering things quickly, often time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the goods by air, there are routes where the unloading and passage through customs can take days.
The only way to get it out faster was to do it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger carrying it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a good chunk of money for that privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
Now, this is not cheap: normally, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and to pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is in common use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.

Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't ruin the place by painting or engraving on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Castilian. Nearly half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the official language of priority.

During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets to women who don't come prepared, but if you wear yours, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Men should also wear trousers that cover their knees.
This piece can also be ordered at the entrance, but it is clothing that is not washed after each use, so you may find it uncomfortable wearing these skirts.

Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or places of education.
As light pollution at its time was not a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Non-Christians in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have also adopted many of the traditions surrounding the holiday.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night by staying up at night in some place in the open sky to watch the sun rise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin the celebrations at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the island did so by swimming, flying or leaping.
