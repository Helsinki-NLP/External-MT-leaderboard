Welsh MPs are worried they'll be confused with the "mapets".
Some Members of Parliament have expressed concern over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern has arisen in connection with the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
MEPs across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it would "make a homonym with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "low" and the word "pwp" means "rubble".
A Plaid MP said the whole lineup was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his own list was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "mapet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to adopt the name change, stated: 'The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will naturally be the Members' own decision.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the House as the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of Members, the Commission voted in favour of the name 'Member of the Welsh Parliament' or WMP, but the choice of MWP was the one that received the most support during the public consultation.
MEPs are obviously proposing alternative options, but the effort to reach consensus can be a difficult affair for Speaker Ellen Jones, who is expected to table the name change bill within the next few weeks.
The reform law will also include other changes to the way the parliament operates, including rules on the removal of the MP's office and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide on the issue of their name in the final vote during the debate on legislation.
The votes are being cast by the citizens of Macedonia for the referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour hides territorial views and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
The President of the Republic of Macedonia, Georgy Ivanov, a supporter of the referendum on the name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that change is simply the price they must pay for their membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say that once there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither".
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing differently today", he said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood's 'lounge' where people frequent regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the authorities hope "and sooner or later return to where it started".
The congregations, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who would not be willing to help the remaining places of worship in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move into these apartments will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
The occupation of the St. Martin building was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners took over the rebuilding and ordered the carriage.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carriage "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July described it somewhat differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance".
The expert, Tiffany Ann of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lidd, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What's been happening in St. Martin's in recent months is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church's popular leaders, while others by the bishop.
The commissioners - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - sent a letter to the bishop in July expressing their concerns that the bishop "would seek to transfer the costs" to the body of commissioners, despite the fact that this had no involvement in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark attack on 13-year-old in a scuba diving spot for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during loose-fishing dives in California on the first day of the loose season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cry of the child crying out for help and approached a group of people sailing to get it out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a shout of excitement because he caught an octopus, but then he realized he was shouting, "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His whole wrist was open", remarked Hamel as he arrived at the boy's location.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Randy's Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Shipwreck rescuer Larry Giles told the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to be of any danger species.
Giles added that the victim is carrying serious injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Pease in Cassabland to Swamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for security and search purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's designs are putting pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is being re-established with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing beauty shelves similar to those of department stores, staffed with special staff.
As the UK cosmetics market continues to grow to a significant rise of £2.8 billion, with sales of clothing and household goods falling, the largest cosmetics shelves will be put on trial in 11 stores across the country and spread to more stores if the project is successful.
Cosmetic investment comes as supermarkets look for ways to fill the space on shelves that once occupied televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will also be given more space with shelves with the company's logo, similar to those of shops like Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its own boutique make-up line so that most products are vegan - something that younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products at two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online shopping and the trend of buying small quantities of food every day at local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make a greater effort to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will increasingly resemble wholesale stores as supermarket chains try to compete with the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services other than food.
Sainsbury's put outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, while also introducing some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute the profits from the pharmacy stores to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury maintenance companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of companies is designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a potential destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping".
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Williams withdrew from the £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from her £11 million deal with her lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wiloby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business has been likened to Goop's company, Gwyneth Paltrou.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced on Instagram her decision to step down.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones, leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden girl of television admitted during a tense conference on Tuesday at his empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to devote to clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company and appears to have doubled Willowby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his country homes.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was about its long-term future, its source of income for decades to come.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlow ready to be put up for sale".
Experts estimate that the departure of the host of Britain's most commercially successful "This Morning" show could cost the company millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares, and further delay in her presentation.
And that could mark the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained close friendships with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the central figure in M&S' campaigns and replace Ed McPartlin in presenting ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source from Jones's close circle said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his business affairs".
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism he received for a comment that some would consider inappropriate for a president, as well as his so positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said that in a telepresenter's style.
"I gave up nothing".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Rai Yong-ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "corresponding response" from the United States following the early disarmament of North Korea.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the Internet in the context of the European Union's internal market is therefore not a sufficient step.
Trump maintained a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have yielded positive results - ending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the remaining American soldiers home.
While he upheld his unusual stance in statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a presidential look, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we would have only 200 people here", Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep through an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their path
In the wake of the Lompoc earthquake, for example, it was announced that no assistance from foreign NGOs would be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is quite difficult", said Ms Shubung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Paulo, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on site.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Service, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palo to determine whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the frequent earthquakes that afflict Indonesia, the country remains tightly unprepared for the fury of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, the same is not true of other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm in Palo, even after a warning, may have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters complicate administrative care even more.
A naval hospital stationed in Lompoc to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had focused his campaign on improving Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and generously allocated money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding plagues Mr. Joco's administration before his re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, using knives, bows, and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Stirridge is tied against Chelsea
Daniel Stirridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stirridge was passed by Serdan Shakiri about 27 metres away from Chelsea's finish with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left and hit the back of the net.
His attempt was driven very high up from the large area and ended up right in the nets.
The ball finally fell over Cape Arisabalaga who jumped to repel it and got into the nets.
"I was trying to get this position, to get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible", Stirridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach, I made a direct switch, didn't think much about it and I shot".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead in the half after a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue forward gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass in this game before he took a valve shot near the centre of the field and ran to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic did a one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the large area.
Azar ran ahead of the defender and finished by sending the ball into the net in the back of the net with a left-handed shot in front of Liverpool's Allison Baker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The tragic death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to statements from the country's natural disaster service early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the area on Friday, creating waves up to 6 meters high, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Puruo Nugrocho, said in a press interview.
The city of Paulo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after killing a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Moose on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something to report it to the police .
Police Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would like to appeal to anyone in the John Street neighborhood who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway as police say they are in the process of informing their immediate family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson-Muse, in an attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that it may be hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene at this time.
A woman came to the stage in tears.
He kept saying "it's awful".
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the police belt and one outside.
Police were standing outside the belt and watching the apartment building.
Anyone with any information please text @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument to be hit by the "recording of history" feud.
His extermination would have been poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of numerous cultural and religious works in England by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "dumb" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In this discussion on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would not be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconography of the English Civil Wars was neither dictated nor executed by Cromwell.
It is possible that the wrong member of the Cromwell family sacrificed for the actions of Thomas's ancestor during the last century.
The excellent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hameau Thornecroft is a feature of his 19th-century image and part of the historiography of a personality many believe to be worthy of homage.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely accurate assumption is the subject of open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable".
Slayer pigs wound Chinese farmer deadly
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose name was revealed only as "Uan", was found with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pigsty at the Liuwangsui market in Guizhou province, southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farm worker prepares to give pig vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of a neighboring pigsty open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig weighed 227 pounds and had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised", said the cousin, known by his nickname "Wu", according to the Guyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Wang entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wan or his cousin.
A market official told the evening news that the pig was placed in a cage to avoid attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wang's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 200-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales onto his tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal away.
After the incident in which a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a poison.
"They're just playful.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should simply show them the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are about to bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern United States .
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa reached winds of 85 mph, constituting a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Puda Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area of winds has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring about 25 centimeters of rainfall across parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity combined with the approaching low-pressure wind zone will create extensive heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall will cause dangerous flooding, overwhelming flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of close to 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour locally, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 centimeters of rain is expected locally in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapidly worsening phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended that you avoid any walking in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rainfall can turn the canyons into tidal rivers and storms will cause local strong winds and sandfall.
The low-pressure area will create some locally heavy rainfall on the coastline of Southern California.
Overall rainfall of over 1 centimetre is likely, which can cause small flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first wet season rainfall in the area.
Some scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the effects expand late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, some strong temperature changes will be observed across the United States as temperatures in the Arctic drop, but in the tropics remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very strong temperature changes at close range.
A typical example of the sharp temperature differences between the central United States was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and will spread again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to begin with high temperatures of 27°C from the Eastern Plains to parts of the Southeast.
The temperature in New York City may reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance of observing above-average temperatures in the eastern United States by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million viewers watched the deposition of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blaisey Ford, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political deadlock continued, with television networks shutting down the regular stream of the show to reverse the last minute on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she's 100 percent sure that at a party when she was a high school student, Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a deposition filed, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's estimates, more than 20.4 million viewers may have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average television viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately made available to other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually has a hard time calculating the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office space.
To see this TV show in its proper dimensions, it's a medium-sized audience that's comparable to watching a playoff football game or the Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News, whose reporters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, averaged 5.69 million viewers during the daytime broadcast, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was cast in the Friday drama.
After the Republican moderate declared he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded protesters disapprove of him on Friday morning as he tried to get into the elevator for a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
He stood up looking down for several minutes as he was being cheered on live on CNN.
"I stand here before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She told him, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were live a few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee vote on advancing Kavanaugh's candidacy for the full Senate floor for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced after discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Counsel and several other senators thereafter, Flake passed away.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that Republicans would not gather the votes to approve Cavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her own on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is a vocal critic of the Chechers Brexit plan, saying the proposal for collecting tariffs between Britain and the EU was "absolutely irrational".
Shot by Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Dayton Simpson for killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and is being held in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Sims's confrontation with Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police located the glasses at the crime scene and said they've traced traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB, which works with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by the Eastern Baton Rouge medical examiner released Friday, the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department has put a special task force at the Louisiana State Police, the police forensics lab, the Southern University police force and local citizens to assist in the investigation into the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joey Aleva thanked local law enforcement for "the thorough investigation and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Oued said the team was "disintegrated" and "in a state of shock" over Oued's death.
"We always worry about incidents like this", said Oued.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popocatepetal volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after activity at the crater peaked, recording 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various signs and small earthquakes.
Images on social media show car blinds covered in thin layers of ash in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as SochiMillo.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the restore units as thousands took part in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote to secede Catalonia that sparked a polarisation.
A group of masked independence protesters, held by the restore units, threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the roads usually flooded by tourists.
Clashes also occurred later in the day with police using their clubs to suppress the clashes.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted the slogan "We do not forgive, we do not forget" against groups of pro-unity protesters who were chanting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid, which is however celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although attendance was low with the anti-independence movement boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt voting in the polling stations in the area where violent clashes took place.
Independence groups camped in barricades on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcisse Termas, 68, an electrician who took part in the independence protests with his wife, said he no longer gave hope for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they were able to vote, but now the situation is stagnant", he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit limited, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders being self-exiled or in detention pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Poots, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded protests in favor of the police with his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunceras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were jailed last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European elections.
"My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the repression we have been receiving from the Spanish Government", he said.
London: Man arrested after car crash at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash at a London residence.
The incident occurred at Bollinagaard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a car fire at some point.
Meanga's strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory.
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard just his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Aubrocks.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed levels with Hibernan in second place.
Gerard's team is undefeated in the league this season and will face the Hartz, who have an eight-point lead next Sunday.
Before this game, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile is on a six-game unbeaten streak in their division, with head coach Holt yet to experience a losing streak since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing opportunities to the visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with its immediacy putting the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and nearly made it to the finish line, but Alan Lithgow thwarted his attempt by slipping Craig Halkett's head off the finish line.
The field officials willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could strain the visitors with free throws and corners.
And that's how the big goal came.
The Rangers were unable to prevent a free throw and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to send the ball to Mengha, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession but found the field's defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced no difficult situations.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos deflected the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was deflected by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow's pass was knocked out in another free throw by Livingston.
Several vertical passes were made in the Livingston area and were repeatedly repulsed, while two penalties were requested - after a claim by Halkett against replacement player Glenn Middleton and one for the hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alexander Lamond from BBC Scotland at the Tony MacArony Arena
Amazing performance and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, were exceptional, exceeding expectations on this upward journey.
Their playing style and personality changed little after their return to top form, but the credit should be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, recruiting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Worrell on guard throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were not inspired.
As good as they have been in the past under Gerard's guidance, they have not met these standards.
Their last game was flawed - they only managed to pass the home guard once and that's a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
The first is the fact that the European Union has been able to make a positive contribution to the development of the European Union.
The weather was good on Saturday (29 September) at the breakfast meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to restore relations with NATO allies.
They had broken down on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police prevented the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close to their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also gave their present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The split of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turks-Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Car accident in Detford: death of cyclist after collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came a few months after a similar incident in which a driver hit and left a cyclist, who lost his life on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said authorities are making efforts to identify the man and notify their immediate family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prisons: Six police officers injured in clashes
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in the men's maximum security prisons, according to the prison directorate's statements.
Riots broke out at Her Majesty Long Lartin's Worcestershire Jail at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been deployed to deal with the riots, which involve eight prisoners and which were manifested in one wing.
The officers were hospitalized with minor facial injuries during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have taken over the incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin prisons.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may serve longer sentences".
His Majesty Long Lartin's prisons hold more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison administrator was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the prison's law enforcement units were called to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwestern portions of the desert, bringing flooding to their passage.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warning notices for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric state less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest models from the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with individual rainfall volumes up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest States, including the central Braconia and the Great Basin, rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is likely, with individual total rainfall volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial as the Southwest States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought", reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining its intensity, on Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Puda Eugenia, Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and, therefore, weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall may occur in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall volumes of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to the northwest Sonora are expected, likely to reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and will reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. states", said the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy flooding and mudslides in the deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Attack on Mintsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terras area of Midsomer North, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are calling for anyone who may have recorded what happened on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says Cavanaugh "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before a hearing on her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Cavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding public service career", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am", he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting outstanding candidates".
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican aide to the leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total death toll is projected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by the giant waves sweeping the shores when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Paulo on Friday when waves of six metres [6.5 ft] hit the land at sunset, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they were hit by it", said Sutopo Purgo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster response agency BNPB, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it swept away cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land", said Nugrocho, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palo Alto.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management agency show many ruined buildings and shops, bridges that have collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugrocho described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He said that heaps of victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palos, in an area called Donghala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication systems "have completely collapsed and there is no information" from Donggala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get even worse", he said.
The Office was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had struck Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting panic-strickenly trying to warn people down the street about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, dragging homes and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also cut communications in the wider area of Paulo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened only to help with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo Alto on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia are over 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala managed to reach the city of Palo, where workers took refuge in Muslim shelters set up in their office yard, they were disaster-stricken on the way, Mr. Dosemba said.
"I was told that they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have taken the sad task of starting the process of relief of the victims, some complain that foreigners, especially experienced aid workers, were not allowed to travel to Paulo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be initiated if the site of an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Auliya Arjani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can apply for international assistance, but there's no decision yet".
As the second day in Palo Alto after Friday's earthquake and tsunami passes, the friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less sad.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman trapped under rubble for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subandono, coach of the Indonesia national paralyzing team, had trained two of the missing paralysts for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Ro Ro Ro Hotel, including Mr. Maddaji, were his students.
"As an older percussionist, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Genton recounted how, when news of the collapse of the Ro Ro Ro Hotel spread to the slum community, he began sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his rivals in Palo who were attending the beach festival.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while supplying an automatic pick-up machine at Newport-on-the-Left.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was supplying an ATM machine in Newport on the Levy, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine from the entertainment complex and was preparing to hand over more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact Newport Police, calling 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature who is officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long been a fan of the late-night Y-pop group and used that alias as the title track for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator stated.
Besides being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you,' West had stated earlier this year, in a discussion about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, meaning "the one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused self, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of several famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Cobbs is known by various names, such as Paff Dandy, P. Diddie or Diddie, but this year he announced he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, TZJ-ZI, is also content with using his name with or without a pun and capital letters.
The president-elect of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student crackdown.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who attend and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment is in addition to statements by various parts of the US government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not have an overall official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to become the world's first country to innovate in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget for AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking to make the next major discovery in the field of AI", Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that won the Best American Player Othello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and questioned when the next one would be held to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the best in academia, it's the companies", he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university officials to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li argued that changes to immigration policy could also help the US support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to those with a PhD in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China adopted a Plan for the Development of Next Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, respectively, to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be joined by partners from business and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation now invests more than $100 million annually in research in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in months in U.S. legislation to create a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
The citizens of Macedonia hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would trigger a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George H.W. Bush has said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the required 50 percent to validate the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to be paid to pursue membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will make our lives safer for all of us", said 79-year-old Olga Gyorgievska, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the outcome of the vote in order to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout reached just 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia Zorof Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in the referendum on changing the country's name to pave the way for the country's NATO and European Union membership in the city of Strumica, the Republic of Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarov, 54, sets up a small tent and places chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as second-class partners", Kavardakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring a lot of investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Polish Policy Research Institute, the referendum would have a turnout of 30 to 43 percent, below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the TV station Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City 's Sergei Avoir is going through Brighton 's entire defense to score .
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were Brighton's defending champions, winning 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguirre showed a very easy lead in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward took a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the stage.
He passed three of Brighton's defenders before he spilled himself into the open.
Then, Aguero was found surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled one defender, then escaped several others on the edge of the greater Brighton area.
Then he passed to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move in the area returning the ball to Averroes, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the net.
"Aveiro is having some problems with his legs", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguirre got the ball deep in the Brighton area at this point.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sané kept the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the back of the net.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the net just before he went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Seine-Saint-Saint-Germany.
Serser wants to beat the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always-competitive Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still repercussions for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a game in the National League West.
The Rockies have made the playoffs with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in first place in their division.
"Even though we have nothing to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game that will probably be the highest level I'll ever play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a race like this?"
The Nationals haven't announced who's going to be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but they're reportedly tending to let Serge throw the ball.
Serge, who's making his 34th start, had practice pitches on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a day off for him.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average (ERA) and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is giving a speech in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation regarding his nominated Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, in his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important election processes of our lives.
This is a very important moment. I am not a candidate, but it is actually like I am and for that reason I travel everywhere to support outstanding candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this miserable, miserable radical Democratic group, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power using whatever means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a "resistance and deterrence" mission.
"And you've seen this for the last four days", he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and evil, miserable and liars".
He referred the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Republican Senator Diane Feinstein, a reference that was met with strong public disapproval.
"Remember her answer?
Did you find the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad-based faction.
He's intolerant of people who express their opinions.
I was not surprised at all that activists in the Momentum movement in my local group voted to impeach me.
I am also the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, precisely because we are giving our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, my indictment was criticized for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, on issues similar to those that Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders about.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, there is not that much of a meeting and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really began to take shape.
It is increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I previously believed we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I was really saying, I heard a whisper on social media, where some people were calling for my rejection, rejecting the centre's policy and telling me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues, as comments to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a surge of sexist or racist attacks every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every motion for a resolution or change in the rules of selection the boundaries of the party narrow.
I've been advised a lot over the last couple of years not to get up, not to talk too much and that "it's gonna be okay".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student still, due to the negligence of the Thatcher government which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my aim has been to secure better public services for those who need them most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, and I did the same in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political views and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have put forward the impeachment motion on Friday, all I can say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will affect our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not to the Momentum members in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Nottingham East constituency.
The Invincible Air is climbing to the top
Two late goals may have somewhat twisted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely entertaining Tenet Championship match today.
They are now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
Ultimately, it was her superior defense, as well as her best exploitation of opportunities, that lifted the balance in favor of the fieldmen, and coach Peter Murcy had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tested our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with a change by Fraser Climone, brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scot Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott scored a goal without a change.
Climate increased Ayr's lead on penalties before scoring a conversion goal just in the half, leading Ayr to the locker room with a 17-5 score.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baggott's conversion, cut the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaring Not, who was dismissed by carriage, and, after the restart, Ayr further increased the gap with a goal from Stafford McDowell, with a change of pace.
Deputy captain Blair MacPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical advantage with a goal by Bruce Colvin without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The fielders returned, however, and when Strouan Hutchinson took a yellow tagline card to the Climate without the ball from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a goal in the back of the attack that Air launched.
Climate made a shift, as it has done almost every time since the reboot, after Kylie Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth home run.
Still Game star starts a new career in food
Still Game star Ford Keernan looks set to make the jump to the food business after it was revealed he's been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hepfield.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth series will be the show's last, and it looks like Keernan is planning his life after Geigland.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Keernan wants to be involved in the "winning food business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Closed Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Seamen patrolling the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are waving in public buildings.
The ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have a slogan: "Our sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to get her back".
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that Chile captured after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been raised today more than ever in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calmness, and naturally looks forward to the outcome with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzandala, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of unstable talks, to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the gifted indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a contentious battle for re-election next year, has a lot to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to grant thousands of territories and has made clear that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court's decision is to be issued only six months after the final arguments are presented suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further advancing Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivian government has seized the issue of access to the sea", Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted any remaining goodwill in Chile, he claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Belje, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements to mutual benefit", he said.
Calzandala also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders, is using the issue of going to sea as a political ruse.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past".
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has stated that his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ray spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
It called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of state.
Ri made these comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared poised to restart a nuclear diplomacy that had come to a halt three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the view that continued sanctions and the US refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the North to "conquer" is a summer nightmare.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes major disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering declassifying an arsenal that the country likely considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available at a store near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or avoid the sun altogether, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the show at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the streets.
The thing that stood out from Valentine was an exaggerated bezel hat decorated with a wide, winged bowl that completely covered the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included carpets decorated with stones, a magic hat, and even an anise, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high-end sewing.
One design brought to mind full diving gear with a breathing apparatus and glass, while another looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you want to adopt this style of fashion with huge accessories, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach the central shopping streets near you.
Supersized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Bomba", the very wide-brimmed hat we've seen so many wear, from Rihanna to Emily Rayechkovsky.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent another big creation to the wallet, a beach bag of sand almost as big as the model carrying it in his swimsuit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelf crosses and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus's 2019 La Riviera Spring-Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing big hats and big beach bags in retail stores next summer, as the designer made such a big impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with a further string of outstanding results in examinations, which were simply further bolstered by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to pupils and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher education degrees, the career they will choose and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a school curriculum on demand, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice course in schools.
Nelson Mandela had said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, then what you say goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say enters his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance charts, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved an A-level.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A-level in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also had an A-level.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as a choice course, are considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that, for reasons why employers found it difficult to fill vacancies, a proportion of the 17 per cent were due to lack of language skills.
The need to acquire language skills is therefore becoming increasingly pressing in order to prepare young people for their future professional careers.
As more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future because of this skill that you can use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in the independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
There is no denying that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for young people in Scotland.
They have to.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council for Scotland.
Lemron's making his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The fan's longing to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After practice a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
"I don't need prep races at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
The Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies starting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings of Trump next week, which includes tours of friendly neighborhoods like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court pending, Trump is seeking to boost popular support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be referred to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, with a Senate confirmation vote pending for up to a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans facing a mixed outcome in the November elections gain momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign staff said that these five rallies next week are aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as we move into the busy campaign period", a Trump campaign spokesman, who chose not to be named, told Reuters.
The planned evening rally at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia's Senate, who is running low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the polls", said Simon Hunter, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has the guts to fight with hope alive as it heads to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon's four might be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendants of the momentum are a perfectly conceived sporting idea, but players believe deeply in it, and especially in such measurements.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were six degrees ahead and now they're four, so we're probably on a little pace", said Jordan Spit as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of leading by four points and remaining 12 points ahead.
Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air in their sails" and have a lot to encourage, like twin Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spit was deadly from tee to green and sets the example.
The festivities' voices got louder as he continued his lap, achieving a decisive blow to get the four all-square game when he and Thomas were down two by two.
The 15th-place game was followed by similar celebrations that showed his conviction that the American team was not out.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your own game", said Spit.
It's what every player has left behind.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin of Europe has won four out of four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only pair not to hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow back and forth from the noisy spectators, highlights the fact that it is the players who will have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory is still premature.
Daddy Watson and Webb Simpson put their glasses on Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles in the front nine they stuck the Spanish and the Swedes so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there won't be anyone to help you out of your hole.
Fourball and foursome are such exciting games to watch up close because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome match also showed that the US team has the courage, despite some doubts.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after leading the fourball and foursome on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the USA.
The inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari twins made a two-game win-loss run against a competitor Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far on four points.
Thomas Björn's European side, trying to keep the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unfortunate American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 draw.
The United States held out the most in the foursome, winning two races, but failed to cover the gap.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Flightwood is the first European newcomer to win four straight points, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a stunning weekend he is only the second twin to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they joined forces to crush a tired Woods and the emerging American Bryson DeSambo with an even more striking 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged into Saturday's two games, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven innings.
Justin Rose, who had rested for the morning fourball, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson for the foursome with 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
Things did not go well for Europe, despite a pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas tied for the American lead with two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome while missing both holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to recover while losing by four points in singles, although because he is the trophy winner, Furyk is only good enough to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence measures.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and that his country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and ballistic tests, decommissioning nuclear testing facilities and a commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it progresses gradually through the process, his statement was significant in that it did not completely rule out unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the "de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "give up" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for easing the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization be done first and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve its goal by blackmailing, even obstructing the declaration of the end of the war", said Rie.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust".
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader pointed to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with ballistic missiles from North Korea was inevitable because "Bullish President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said much more had to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it's okay".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its measures.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until complete, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to neutralize funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, and that North Korea had denounced him hours later for having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dry up a missile facility and also a nuclear compound if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He clarified that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and promoting the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking classes on how to get enough rest.
This year, a new class at Harvard University is looking to get all undergraduate students more sleep in an effort to combat the growing buzz culture of overnight study by consuming too much caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the world's number one university often do not know basic things, such as how to care for themselves.
Charles Chiseller, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the class after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Eventually, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I just learning about this now, my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The class, which first began this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course when it found that students were significantly sleep deprived during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", added Professor Chiseller.
The culture of pride in studying all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sufficient, good-quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" for fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a persistent feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a class across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before they begin their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chiseller advised students to set up a wake-up alarm for when they should go to bed, and an alarm clock for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can dissonance the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores on Gerard 's men
The Rangers suffered another sad off-field defeat as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Gerrard's dissonant side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Aibrocks were looking to score their first away win since their 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerard's only second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind Harts, who are first in the Ladbrokes championship standings.
Meanga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired roster seemed incapable of returning.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is in third, just one goal away from the Hibernate who are ahead.
And Rangers may be in more trouble, as Superintendent Callum Spence had to get first aid for a head injury caused by an object thrown off the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the squad and spooked Ayr in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Livi 11" that got a score from Hartz last week and would be happy how this well-charged machine of his could stifle every effort of his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the middle didn't find the ball.
A deep free throw from Keegan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but fellow defensive back Alan Lithgow all he could do was send the ball away from the stake.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the last quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he should have won a penalty at 15 when he clashed with Stephen Lawless, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers had only two home runs in the first half, but former Aibrox quarterback Liam Kelly was not at all concerned about Lasanna Kuliballi's head and Obi Ezzaria's undertoned shot.
Although Livi was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of the game, no one can deny that he was worth the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to address Jacobs' problem.
Scott Orfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga just completing the effort.
Gerard made changes to the halftime by taking out Culiballi and putting in Ryan Kent, and the change paid off almost immediately as the extreme passed the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of play she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Halcett removing one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the gap towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Litgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another penalty phase towards the end as he collided with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from the Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BUT... the day that in Germany the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, and this invention eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science ever since, Geiger's counter has moved into the pop culture sphere, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of atoms caused by radiation on metallic elements".
Evans: "Look, he's acting like crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues its work.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problem cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problem cells and kill them
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells in the context of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein that is common to various cancers and then re-energize
A vaccine under trial has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who received treatment with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine on our hands".
As Professor Berzowski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force behind the development of several cancers", such as breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the tagline MAGA, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was dismissed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a high-profile interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After also presenting his third song for the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a parody rally against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to a white guy a lot and he says, 'But how do you like Trump?
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blazey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it didn't air, the video of West's insanity was leaked to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West with this post.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was not treated well in the background because of his hat.
"I was bowled out in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with your hat".
They bowled me!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
I'm going to wear the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments were rejected at least twice by the public and SNL's presenters appeared to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person stating to the magazine: "There was a death silence throughout the studio".
West was called in to replace the late singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused a lot of people when he sang I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous minds: THE ANTITY OF THE WORLD".
However, the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "his own self and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embodying and promoting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddie, also known as Pff Diddie, Pappy and P. Diddie.
Rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

The charges will be investigated by the D.A.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington is criticizing toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the heroic pack, saying that such roles on screen send the message to young boys that they must be tough to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said "something is wrong" and questioned how to fight the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has a "strong view" on the matter.
"Personally, now I believe it very much. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow older about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must display such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people".
In the interview he also admitted that he had no intention of playing in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, saying "an end to battles and horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever done since Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the lineup, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Higgrit, the love-hate outcast of John Snow, the character played by Kit, on the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of cases, new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly in some parts of China because of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had nearly declined, as health officials in China had stated at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT community members remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that senior Republican senators leaked data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters disproved claims that a member of her staff posted personal information on the legislator's Wikipedia pages for three Republican senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were being promoted by commentators and "far-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies", Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information published is said to include the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and appears to have been posted by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill area during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the details of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and a foolish lie", Waters continued.
'The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false claims was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and a foolish lie".
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Flaisser.
"This deception is full of anger", wrote Flaisir.
"This shows he has no guts to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
It doesn't have to be cowardly.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and calm".
Fletcher appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of appearing very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything to find those responsible", he continued, "and hold them accountable for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all of my staff".
Criticism of Johnny English Re-Hit - a subtly spying film starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new British-themed film, and that seems to be true in this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Could this humorous auto-satire about how obviously bad we are turn into the nation's next export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglis with his blindfolded eyes was able to renew his license to make them a mantra for the second time, and his name indicates that it is a broader comic creation designed for non-English speaking film audiences.
It's of course the shrewd secret agent who, while pretending to have the glow and manners of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bean" and something from the guy who played one note on the theme music of the movie The Roads of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the most forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, sowing chaos in his path.
There's a good time or two in this last J.E. movie.
I liked it when Johnny Inglis approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent for comedy, however, humor is quite subtle and oddly subtle, especially as "serious" film franchises like 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite a bit of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny Inglis' crazy backstories are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's film-style sketches of the character of Bean.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret internet spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on assignment, much to the dismay of the agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a sadly small role for his own safety.
It's the last straw for a pompous and ambitious prime minister on the brink of collapse because of anti-popular politics: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script isn't helping her much.
The intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she should bring back someone disarmed.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as a principal at an aristocratic school, but gives informal courses for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers a spy academy like One School Too Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunits with Buff's former and passionate partner, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role that Vicky Pepperdine is not fully utilizing.
So Batman and Robin of the Secret Service of Her Majesty's Caucus return to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ophelia Bouletova played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's technological misery: the menacing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Buff begin their epic of farce: disguised as waiters, set fire to a quaint French restaurant, cause chaos as they attempt to illegally board the luxurious Volta yacht, and Inglis provokes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and noisy as it is, it still reminds me a little of children's TV.
It's only a matter of time.
And like the other Johnny English films, I wonder, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he'll really grow up with his talent?
Labour denies they're considering a plan to work four days for the British, but pay for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan to make British people work four days a week but pay for five-day work.
The party is reportedly seeking to channel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them one extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend without any reduction in wages.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the tide in favour of the workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to help workers benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry".
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
The secretary of the shadow government, John MacDonnell, used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from the "directors" and "earnings scouts" of the public benefit corporations.
The shadow government secretary's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire stake back, as a potential Labour government could make "holdings" due to suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and to create mutual funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual allowances of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are speaking on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelly, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said that on my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after the matter, when the matter came out in the court, and said to him directly, Didst thou do this?
He was steady, determined, decisive".
However, Graham's vote seems unlikely to change.
"I've decided on Brett Cavano and it will take some explosive charge to change my mind", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
"And whoever has named it cannot confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, tens of thousands are expected to creep into Central Park's Great Lawn as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to delight artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international lobby group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting it.
To secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or finding other meaningful ways to contribute to awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another instance of so-called "clique activism", when some people feel they are really making a difference by signing an e-request or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been deployed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, which has pledged to "help children reach their full potential", pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history", Tracy Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told audiences during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is aimed at 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to the question "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?" that is included in the FAQs on the website,
One member of the Global Citizen community responded: "The road will be long and hard, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the big human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickett, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mona are some of the artists to perform at this year's New York City event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington could turn to its Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from being delivered to markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zincke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinka claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in eastern and southern Europe", he said, according to sources.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to address Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that Russian energy is not put on the market", he said.
Zinka was addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group described as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He criticized Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, to a large extent, the exploitation and replacement of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "honey who knows only one trick", as it has an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The announcements came as the Trump administration has taken on the task of boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump says will make Berlin "occupied" by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is to double the existing capacity of pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude provoked a reaction from Germany, which stressed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at Holyoke Township, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that's why we need a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider a possible candidacy for the presidency".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying that he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren didn't say anything about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe he should run for the presidency in 2020.
58% of "potential" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% were in favour of such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from Democrats discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll have a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to the Traumatic Stress Disorder at the Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"From what my son has been through since he came back, I can understand other families living with the effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the wounds our soldiers carry when they return home", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb about to go off", and said of her son and other veterans that they "come back a little different, come back tougher, come back wondering if there is respect for what the soldiers, airmen and every other member of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new political asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region filed an amicus curiae brief on Friday in Washington, D.C., supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her, however, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing severe gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence situations to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Carl Rassin, said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
'In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "form an essential workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration court judges to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Failed rescue efforts in Paulo as the death toll doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very intense", said 35-year-old mother Rizza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
"Every minute, ambulances are bringing more bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Some residents tried to return to their destroyed homes and collect their belongings from the water, trying to contain whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to meet the needs.
Some wounded, such as Duy Harris, who suffered a broken waist and shoulder, remained outside the Paulo Army Hospital, where first aid was being given outdoors due to the ongoing strong earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the rubble of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "terrorism" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper bidding for mutual trade benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump cited last Wednesday the paid insert in the China Daily that appeared in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the US election signaled what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of the escalating campaign that Washington has launched to exert pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from advertising to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on imports on each other.
China's tariff retaliations in the early days of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt America's workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brundt wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is giving in to this kind of intimidation by posting propaganda ads in our free press".
"In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's precious tradition of free speech and free press by posting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Brundt wrote.
"In contrast, in Beijing's stands, you will find few divergent voices and no real representation of the different views the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic course, given that the media is controlled by the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided an offer to publish" his article, though he did not disclose which.
Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many leading Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn there will be a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The vote on this issue is particularly tense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored", Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill of a paper published Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move to call for an investigation by the FBI will be enough to lure angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday, they're not going to forget tomorrow, and they're definitely not going to forget November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national press spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the "November is coming!" slogan in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the green light to Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels", Stu Rodenberg, an unarmed political analyst, told the news website.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the group of undecided suburban women voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while hating the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had predicted that a reaction could be made if Republicans went ahead with the vote.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Still, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is going to be voted out, it's about how Republicans have handled the issue and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the Fort and Cavanaugh depositions, tending slightly more to favor the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Cavanaugh likely or certainly lied in his statement, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI began investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other alleged alleged, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while they were at a party when they were both students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new pain in this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on the open platform Solids by Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, who will be able to access it and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burns Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment.
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform allowing users to create their own 'personal electronic data storage space' or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in a single browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of personal data storage is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this a "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is for the company to offer the resources, processes and skills necessary to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company consists of Burns Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project, and a community of volunteer code developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they're allowed to make radical changes, toppling business models overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a Medium post released Saturday, Burns Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new fabric being created on the basis of the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Burns Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honoured in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military distinction.
On Saturday a memorial plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, which was accompanied by a parade at Rastden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the disclosures of the plaque were made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his regiment into the Seine-Centine Canal amidst very dense fog and while receiving heavy fire from battle arms and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "exceptional bravery" drove the line forward, before striking three of the detachment with a single gun.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's heroic deeds were "something I know I could never reach, something that makes you feel unlimited respect".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van stated that he "felt great honor to have participated in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support he has from many people".
MMA fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Pig
Consider the following scenario: You've slept through the night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you're deprived of the joy of seeing this unique sporting event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be broadcast live in the UK, from Channel 5, on the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gagard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out on the ring, viewers in the UK were left in a state of shock when the show switched to Peppa the Pig.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed up until the early hours of the morning especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the screening of the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"Under the law, this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be shown", said Dave Swartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppas the Piglet, of course".
Bellator President Scott Cocker said the programme would be developed to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the ripples, I think we can do it", said Cocker.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our time, their Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change happened, there was a lot of back-and-forth texting and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was the regulations.
I promise you, next time, that's not gonna happen.
We're gonna limit it to five games instead of six, like we usually do, and we tried to offer more to the fans and we got past it.
It's an unpleasant situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, however, that it did motivate him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne presented on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he's been less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter on the popular radio show, was on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt "inadequate" compared to others growing up because "it was socially unacceptable for anyone to like both boys and girls".
She said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and will to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympian is a prominent advocate for the rights of the LGBT community and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move toward decriminalizing homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak up because he felt lucky he could live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was "a surprise" when she fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar-winning Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years his senior, but he maintained that age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (he first competed in the Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has such good times and bad times".
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said he had changed "his whole outlook".
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal", he said.
"But there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you won't be around to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and he was dead finally accepted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life, competing in diving at the Olympics in my hometown, there was no better feeling", she said.
This also inspired his choice of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which stalked him in preparation for the Olympics and still gives him a twinge.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outfit Mickelson will be sitting on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who is competing for the 12th time (record number) in the two-yearly games, was forced by captain Jim Furyk to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as is the custom for the United States, the five-time winner has been assigned a day to cheer up the lines and "work" his game in the hope of correcting his troubles.
Without ever having been the most straightforward driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National, where long distance is often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the pitch were not enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, British Open champion, who is partnering with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can get the lead with a good start, Mickelson's play could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He took full responsibility for today's role, hit me in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"She has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he's done a lot for these teams, both past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, and so we felt we had to walk.
He wants to go out there like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday Ryder Cup games.
He could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that didn't reach the height of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence was beneficial for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spirited, likes to make jokes and is great in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed playing him this week.
His contribution is not just to the game".
The European team leader, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big lead may soon be lost.
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead starting with the last day of singles at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
The Danish made his debut at the 1997 Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros managed to take a five-point lead over the Americans, but only managed to cross the finish line by breast difference, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but hardly ever", said Björn, in the image, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're leaving tomorrow ready to give it all away.
We're gonna go out there and play it right.
Nothing's over until you see the scores on the painting.
We have one goal, to win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I always say I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players on the other team -- the best in the world".
Satisfied with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Björn adds: "I would not be in a hurry to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow is the day that individual performance counts, and that's something else.
It's great to be on the court with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you're putting your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, how to bring out their best tomorrow.
You leave your partner behind and he has to give his best".
Unlike Björn, Jim Furyk of the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their teammates, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both ends of the last day's upheavals as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat as Europe performed its miracle.
"I remember every last word", he replied when asked how Ben Cranso, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We decide our order accordingly and play the order we like, we'll try to do our magic tomorrow".
Thomas has taken over the lead and is facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Powler, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it covers the whole route", Björn said justifying his choices for singles.
New postponement for the new German warship
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it will not be commissioned until at least the following year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media report.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class all-new frigate fleet, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a representative of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems with delivery were decisive for the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They'll carry powerful cannons, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and audio signatures.
Other important features are that maintenance work is reduced in frequency, as it will be possible to use the new ferries for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that although warships are considered state-of-the-art, which will allow Germany to show its strength abroad until they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after the delivery.
Not much information has been released on the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of significant "defects with software and hardware" that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half as many as the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship is much heavier, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached the approximate amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3,6 billion) whereas the initial budget was EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems affecting the new frigates are particularly important as Germany's naval power shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said the problem had grown worse over time because the old ships had been dismantled, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is covering up the secret life of bats.
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting for their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to plan future environmental action.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanotrotter and microtrotter, as well as the brown oton-ratter and Dobbendan myodite in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Specialist loggers will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile searches using hand-held sensors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of calls made by bats, as well as which species have this behavior.
A bio-space map and an exhibition will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Diwar, environmental consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects affecting the places where they bark and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are fly-stick films and some building materials chemicals, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use an advanced sound-identification technique to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the locations where bats swarm, and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also set up Scotland's first and only bat-only refuge at Threave Farm, Dunfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, many big trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations".
It stresses that it is important to check for bats first before any household maintenance work, as destroying a single nest with young could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and are forbidden to be killed, harassed or disturbed or to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, executive of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer their help.
He said: "There is much to learn about our bats and about many of our species we simply do not know the evolution of their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him "fake news", saying that some "want to make themselves known" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The Portuguese national and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not report anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers following the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is fake news", said the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
"They want to expose themselves and exploit my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I am happy and all is well", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations it has published, which they described as "unacceptable reporting of rumors affecting private life", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Skerts said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage proportional to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her unnaturally according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but betrayed the other "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared possible reprisals" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of being transferred to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he joined Italian Juventus for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of the car industry
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car industry stated that the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's CEO in Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern concerns the risks to the supply chain according to the automotive industry in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of components according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold stock for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, thus stopping production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically aimed at solving the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal possible that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that supply chain continuity must necessarily be ensured".
Toyota was unable to say how much carrot it would stop production, however, it warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvallari, who has been working at Bernaston for 24 years and is Unite's union manager at the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House announces.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" as the debate continues over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump aides' ties to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump fires the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a hat to record his conversations with Trump and enable the removal of the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed so as not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote by the full Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no date yet, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week to be postponed given all other cases before the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, because I like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists have disputed this claim: Sanders has been holding a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why this was happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of the news was not due to dislike of the "impressive" moves of television journalists, though she said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are showing up".
Then let it be implied that there will be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president is interviewing more people than any previous president", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at those numbers".
Updates will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to apply it often and you've seen that we've been applying it often in recent weeks and it's going to take the place of the press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States".
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press interviews with official guests.
Individual press interviews are rare.
This week in New York the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a gathering of journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health Service amid fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health Service to express their gratitude and to wish them to remain after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.
Jean Freeman, Member of Parliament for Scotland, has sent a letter with less than six months to go before the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued and decisions are expected in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean newspaper reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before the halftime.
"He came to the bench and just collapsed there", said Reed.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave AmberCrooby oxygen on the bench and then put him in a hold and transported him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Ambercrobe was released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "not yet any data on the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Ambercrobe, a second-year redshirt student, is spending his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before retiring from the game, thus reaching 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher signage fee for buying real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tories plans.
The measure would counteract the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on non-taxable buyers in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will start to be charged a higher signage fee for buying real estate in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless, as announced today by Theresa May.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to derail the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and to target high wages.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons not taxed in the UK, while the additional funds will strengthen the government's campaign to fight homelessness.
The increase, imposed at the current end of the lease, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and rental homes, can be as high as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new homes in London are bought by people not resident in the UK, leading to higher prices and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's affluent areas - particularly the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the price of a ticket so more young people can get their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by acquiring land without using it and called on Mrs May to remove roofs on economic housing in order to restore Britain's "housing disgrace".
Mr Corbyn announced a series of impressive housing reforms, including rental controls and a ban on evictions 'without blame'.
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - to improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means fixing the broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it would not be right for non-UK residents and overseas-based companies to buy homes as easily as hardworking British nationals.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has now become too distant and the dishonesty of homelessness remains".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scotland team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that his "absolute ambition" is to become Scotland's national team coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of reviving the North East England team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a call-up to the second national team and that was it", Ross told the BBC in Scotland on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have success in team coaching".
Among Ross's predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paolo D'Cano.
The former coach of Aloa Athletic says he was not shocked when he was called upon to inherit such established names in such a large team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured by the answer to the question, "Can I get this team back to the Premier League?"
"Given the structure and facilities of this team, it is undoubtedly Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there".
Ross started his coaching career just three years ago, having spent a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the coaching staff at Hart's.
He then helped Aloe bounce back from relegation to the third division and led Saint-Myren from the bottom to win the Championship the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he said, recalling the position of Aloha's coach.
"I really believed that I was better suited to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making decent money out of it, and I had gotten pretty high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I still struggle with the stress and the pressure of work, but the job of a coach suits me perfectly.
I always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I have felt with myself all my adult life".

The best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturdays, according to research.
The summer heat boosted profits for Britain's tried-and-true pubs but brought more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which gathered the data, said: "The constant sunshine and England's higher-than-expected World Cup participation resulted in July following a similar pattern to the previous month, June, where pub profits rose 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered an even greater blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenue in June just worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcohol fared much better, with the corresponding figures in previous years rising more than the corresponding figures in restaurants fell.
Food-serving pubs also suffered from sunny days, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all pubs and bars operated, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, of the entertainment and hospitality analyst department at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since late April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in sales on the off-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year on year will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for businessmen in the food industry, and time will tell if the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give us a much-needed extension".
The overall increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyses performance data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over £9 million and is the industry's established benchmark.

A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a sharp increase in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo sharing website Instagram.
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they maintain a healthy "master" account to show their parents while maintaining private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website spotted a teenager who urged others to rape her ("rape me").
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools' Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to holding hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites where they cannot be identified by their parents and teachers".
Eylind Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Steering Committee.
Eylind Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Steering Board at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded female athlete and President Ian Beatty has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eaild is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and global steve community and we are confident that the steve in Scotland will benefit enormously from her membership", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, became paralyzed after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising of a mammal comparing mothers to cows divides online public opinion
A breastfeeding company has divided online public opinion with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to mating cows.
To launch what is being called the world's first silent and wearable breastfeed, consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous video clip to highlight the freedom the new breastfeed offers nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm grinding myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't haystacks, these are my boobs".
The choir goes on: "Pick it up, pick it up, I'm feeding babies, pick it up, pick it up, I'm baking my ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it doesn't take the "horror" of the dairy industry seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth", one commented.
Elvie's mammary gland is discreetly contained within a breastfeeding tube.
Another commented: "Apparently traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "A totally out of reality ad".
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "heartbreaking".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy a carnivore like that if I were still a carnivore.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't want to over-analyze it.
It's a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at moms who pump breast milk (often at work or in bathrooms) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women's team reveals that all of them were dancing with their distinctive breasts wrapped in their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk with breastmilk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breast, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding mattress, allowing women to move, hold their babies, and even go outside during the pump.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie steamer is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By making a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk extraction and all the challenges it entails, while also showing in a fun and relevant way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breed will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie storm has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared in a passenger seat for fashion designer Marta Yakumbovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has risen, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children with supporters.
Traditionally, most conservatives are immigrants without travel documents themselves and are afraid to come forward and ask for a child and thus jeopardize their ability to stay in the country.
The danger was heightened in June when the federal authorities announced that potential carers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who requested to be held in solitary confinement.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either caregivers or members of the caregiver household are in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreign criminals.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of the environment.
In order to handle cases of children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that some of these children should appear in court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as was previously the case, according to workers in shelters.
Many will appear via videoconference, in the position of a personal appearance, to develop their claims for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for exemption will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become stressed or distressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are heightened in larger facilities such as Torneo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to go unnoticed due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the movie theater without giving them enough time to prepare psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can worsen the trauma they already struggle with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'aleem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this holy battle until we expel all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily training and informing both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Muallem said the conditions were good for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that have driven refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would "be neutralized".
The UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Muallem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interference should be made.
Because Trump is gonna win a second term.
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
Which would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidential finale of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of viewers being tired.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the high-definition zone has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-definition area, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned satellite TV viewership figures, with 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand", said Neil Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Neil Skovel, veteran comic book writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovel said.
You can have fun even in chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roy v. Wade if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you sit for six hours watching a panel of experts discuss the use of "many behind-the-scenes interviews" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar strut-camel bomber jacket, and the implications of Storm Daniels' glaring descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm never gonna see Super Mario the same way again.
"What it does and gives you the feel of a reality show is that it gives you something every night", said Brad Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the television show "Pawn Stars", about the constantly changing cast and the daily twists and turns in the plot of Trump's show (flashes with the NFL, praises Kim Jong-un).
You don't have the luxury of missing an episode, or you're stuck.
When I met with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny day at 26 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
"I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, 'This is going to mark the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right after all".

Foreign money is entering the most limited contest for the midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a flow of money, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that put two incumbents running for the same position.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburb is represented by Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb, who was elected to another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former 12th Pennsylvania House District, which largely coincides with the new 17th House District.
The maps were redesigned following a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January that the old districts were being manipulated unconstitutionally to benefit Republicans.
The election contest in the new 17th constituency triggered a campaign of financial competition between the major financial divisions of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide victory in a special election contest held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which was attended by a large crowd.
That position has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China, but backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", the agency's press spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent refugees from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, effectively ending the idea of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, highlighting the importance of the meeting to the administration, as the diplomats said.
All three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House press spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Read the History
The next blow may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr Trump's obstruction of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been released.
It is rumoured that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation to the possibility of a match between Mr Trump's election campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to run for president again in the next election and perhaps eventually before a jury.
The "ifs" are many and I do not mean that the fall of Mr Trump or his European bonds is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unbridled course of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote in that paper that last year he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him unfit for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"What would we say if the recently requested F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the well-founded accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, given the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light a Jewish Sabbath candle at that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the fight with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Viaregio earlier this month, will give them plenty of chances to be eliminated from Group 7 of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Viareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Viarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game thinking we could achieve something and came out with a score.
Maybe we could get away with it at the end, but, in general, the draw was a fairly fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Well, with the things, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the people on the podium, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one, because of my injuries and the changes that happened to the team itself, but there's a positive feeling now.
The team's good and the kids are enjoying it, the training is good.
Let's hope we can put our best foot forward now, leave last season behind and make it work".
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their families.
Nearly half of the Nationwide survey respondents said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want their families to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to make the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
Start with that.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a purchase price to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Make your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Have a health care proxy to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider making a financial allowance.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on your behalf on financial matters and to ensure that your bills are paid in case you become incapable.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your aging parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please include these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issue, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan".

The victim did not see the perpetrator of the attack.
The injuries he suffered are not life-threatening and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, according to official sources, while the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications cut off, aid forces have been unable to get information from Donggala, a region north of Palo, which is closest to the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were displaced after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palo and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palo is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a reigning monarchy that stretches over 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline on the southwestern tip of Sulawesi Island.
The Viceroyalty, a tier of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic mainstays of Central Sulawesi, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is found most often in Morowali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palo and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located within the earthquake-prone Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Some of the most recent major earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of northern Sumatra, Indonesia on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude Richter-scale earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 Richter scale earthquake with a center near the city of Pudong, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude Richter-Scale earthquake struck one of the Mendai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-level earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya region of Ashe, causing disaster and panic as it brought to the world memories of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily deserted.
Sarah Palin's first-born son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence report and resistance to authority, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers Police.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, he grabbed her phone from her hands.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su's temporary detention facility on a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "certainly, innocent" when questioned, the network reports.
Palin is facing three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class A misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice for the crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His partner claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media is streaming videos of the disastrous event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Paulo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the infrequent death penalty for the suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipoff, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saypov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot van to attack a cycleway along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists found in his path on October 31.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saypov killed the eight victims "deliberately" and caused serious bodily harm "deliberately", according to the death penalty intent statement filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry the death penalty, according to the plea.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saypov to trial on a 22-point charge, which included eight counts of pro-criminal homicide, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violent and vehicular destruction.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saifov carried out the attack as "horrible, cruel and useless".
"Saïfulo Habiboulaévitch Saipoff caused pain, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Panúco", the intention statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York filed a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal case was sentenced to death in New York was in 1953 for the husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saypov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was satisfied with his act, according to police.
Saypov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS video he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to plant the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saypov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole will merely prolong the trauma that the events caused for all involved", Patton said.
Saypov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NITZEL FARATZ should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest rally at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have already left" by now if Mr Farage had been the minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge Ms May faces in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underscored by the fact that pro-Brexit supporters in the EU were taking part in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chechers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit supporters, pro-staying in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted on her pushing forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Boone told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to blow up "the Chers plan".
He said that Mr Farage should have been given a title of nobility and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have left now", he said.
The Welingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we must throw the Chekers plan out".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr Boone rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue".
Brexit supporter Tory MP Andrea Jenkins was also present at the protest and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checker plan has no public approval, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it has no approval from our party and our activists who take to the streets and ultimately elect us.
Please leave the Chekers plan and start listening".
With a sharp message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said at the protest rally that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now there is a question of trust between us - the people - and the political order", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it if you do that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We declare the people's army of this country that gave us victory over Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists were thinking of a Tory banner against Brexit after the group rallied this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the session.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-style agreement  Canada with enrichment, for unhindered borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"He is a complete fiasco.

The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future plans during a rally in western Massachusetts' city hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November, with Republican state representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, running for re-election.
He's highly speculating that he might be able to negotiate with Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event was the 36th meeting of voters using the city hall structures since Trump began his term.
A delegate at the meeting asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to form our broken government and that means a woman must be at the top".
Arrest for the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Sims
LAPD in Baton Rouge announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson in a press conference at 11pm Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man who appeared in the video.
20-year-old Sims was fatally shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wed Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which led to his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene with his gun in his possession and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is being held at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 1.98-pound third-year Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, with 10 starts as a starter last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is heading for a world title as his team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Valterie Boots passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
Initially, Botas had a good start and almost hanged Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Fettell to attack his homestay.
Fettell got to the pits first and let Hamilton run the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits a lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior due to the risk of falling into the double traffic violation to defend the third corner.
Max Fairstappen started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for much of the race, holding his tires aiming to finish fast and pass in front of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits in the 44th round, but he couldn't boost his speed in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen came fourth.
It's a tough day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did exceptionally well and did one or two", said Hamilton.
Body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn't leak the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "bad-will and miserable and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's happening these last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and mean and miserable and liars", he said.
"When you see the publications and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember ?
Diane Feinstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't", he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak was from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported in Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret as he asked".
But her refusal did not seem to impress the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you something, body language was very bad.
He may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president implied that the Democrats were using the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any means necessary.
You see the conspiracy, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to take power and control", the president said, according to the Mediaite news website.
The Nandy Stars are 5-3 with the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dandy.
The Dandy Stars have been relieved of their Friday Elite League defeat by the Belfast Giants, winning the 5-3 draw at Dandy on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowieer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought the tie to the field before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchar tied for the Dandy and then two goals from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who were coming off a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the scoring in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assist, while David Rutherford gave the assist which Bowieer doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an action-packed opening period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquard gave up the assist for a tie from Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when he scored his second goal for the night towards the end of the first period.
The field team was reorganized and Bouchar tied again with a power-show goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dandy a lead for the first time in the match towards the end of the second period and he secured the win with his team's fifth goal midway through the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of plane passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero as he lost his life trying to secure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing due to a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in ruins in the city of Paulo.
But even as his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position at the manically moving control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo Alto.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia press spokesman Johannes Shireet said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Paulo.
"We are shocked by his death", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to Donggala, Shigi and Butong cities is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further, as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them have not been reached", said the agency's press spokesman, Sutopo Purgo Nugrocho.
Floods up to six metres in height destroyed the Paulo, which will hold a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
"The mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work night and night to finish any work related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crash in a lake
The airline that operated a plane that crashed into a Pacific seabed in Micronesia now reports a man missing, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release said that as of Saturday afternoon it has not been able to find the tracks of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuc Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane sank in the lake off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jans said the plane landed too low.
"This is extremely good", said Janice.
Jens said that he and others managed to walk through the water reaching them to the midway to the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the aircrew were panicking and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped rescue by using a floating boat to transport people to shore before the ship sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline collisions registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these collisions involved Air Niugini.
Analyst quotes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecuting authority concluded its investigation Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to sequence the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location records from several cell phones that showed Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, disproving his previous claims, as reported by the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecuting attorney asked him if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life", Hale said.
The defense is about to begin its recall on Sunday.
The judge said he estimated that later that day the trial would be put to the jury.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view that prevails about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip-hop has moved away from its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent recovery in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
New York nanny sues a couple who fired her after receiving a "racism" message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a text message accidentally sent to her by her mother complaining that the nanny was "another black man".
The couple denies being racist, liking the suit to "chantage".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Morris was black, just as the latter showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
"THE WORLD of the Dead" wrote Mrs. Placko-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris and even twice.
Once she realized her gap, the embarrassed Mr. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done no good job at all and was waiting for a Filipino in her place, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her one and only day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Ms. Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and is seeking compensation of the order of $350 a day for the six-month work as an in-house nanny, for which she was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, while adding "I know it's discretionary treatment".
The couple dispute claims that they are racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they could not trust her again after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not racist.
We are not racists", said husband Joel Placco to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now".
Describing the case as "chantage", Placo said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you hunt down someone in this situation?
It is not so kind,' the banker added.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to convict the couple on social media, denouncing them for their behavior and reason.
The publishers of the Paddington were afraid that readers would not show interest in a talking bear, as revealed in a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the position of someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the massive success of Paddington".
She said her father, who worked as an illustrator for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet" as her father passed away last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a rather quiet man and he was not proud", he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of it even if it's not really your accomplishment.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he was a work of his own imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Nicaea Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling me and telling me it was too bad, that he didn't have much hope of making it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"At one point, Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tassi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were gradually declining and leaving her system.
He had already died a while ago and then and now everything was erased.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream or I couldn't cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
"I had my head down and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I had a feeling of compassion for Ned.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women mourning the loss of their loved ones hang cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales with cards with exciting messages and phone numbers that can be called for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lyndney, said her son was a very promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up the room".
However, he quit his job before he died, "because he was in very bad shape".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried that there will be an impact".
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Do not remain silent - you must speak".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or anything like that.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had fallen on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye".
He said that his death caused them a tremendous trauma, but they had to overcome it: "It's breaking up the family.
It's crushing us down.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited-scale and limited-subject investigation - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be dissolved amid entrenched party dead ends.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the current situation.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to win the election of the person they want to the country's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls on senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him he meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is submitted?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to win a majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels falls under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean rebels to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 displacements last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher passenger charges were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean apostates are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers apostates illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly expels them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together on the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm our country first", Mr. Rim said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical", says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was instinctively unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help but think that if a woman behaved in this way, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with a keen emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Cavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost shouting and his voice trembling as he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "terrible and coordinated political assassination of character", organized by liberals who have become angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony has proven that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court, as it has shown that he is biased against the Democrats.
"I think he shut himself out with these statements and the way he did it against the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi responded when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not just fit for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's serving in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?' " said Pelosi.
And women should have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of anger are running out, and she can't get it out of her head without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a senior official somewhere, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you".
And so it just kept going.
And it seemed great".
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they're basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of a job I did in an office once dominated by men is when I was crying in unspoken anger and was grabbed from the ceiling by an older woman - a cold executive I was always slightly afraid of - and dragged me up a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy that they broke your heart".
Patricia Shrader, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't such a wise decision", she said laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign had already begun a long time ago, he was back on the financing and so he swore he wouldn't run for office unless he had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was very much burdened with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism - that she felt a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Sreder recalls of the type's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what's gonna be written on my gravestone?
"Did he cry?"
How the US-China trade war can do Beijing good
The warmth of the trade war between the United States and China has been outrageous, and while the battle has a long way to go, a break between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week, with new tariffs imposed on items worth US$200 million (£150 million), essentially taxing half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns fireworks in kind every time, while recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 million worth of goods.
China is determined to retaliate against American fire and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to shut it down anytime soon.
In order to get Washington to back down, he would have to give in to their demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, U.S. trade war pressure could prove positive for China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted in the past", said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Center for New American Security, Asia, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country damaged by the seven-year (and longer) war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'aleem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that were plaguing their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Mu'aleem said that aid to rebuild the destroyed country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe is closing the race to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The American team has now been defeated six times in a row on European soil and has won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the lead, as the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Mickelston, who fought hard for most of the tournament, threw his shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Mollinari has excelled in all his rounds and thus became one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated in the 5&4 by the lowest ranked player of the European team, Danu Thorbigorn Olsen.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, was 2-1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia was crowned the most successful European of all time in the tournament with an overall score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we got the cup back.
Everything is for the team and I am happy that I was able to help", Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He's giving the bat to fellow American John Ram, who defeated golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a home game on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At some point this morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us".
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota counties
The latest announcement from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, conditions of anomaterial spots are observed in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which suggests a decrease in concentrations.
A scar of the Red Sea stretches for about 130 miles along the coastline from Pinellas County north to Lee County south.
