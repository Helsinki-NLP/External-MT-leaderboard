Wales is worried that they will be seen as hypocrites
Some ACs are concerned about the suggestion to change their English titles to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Aelod Senedd Cymru in Welsh).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Assembly.
ACs across the political spectrum worry that this could be a raw material.
The Labour AC said that its group was concerned because the title was confusing with the words 'Twp' and 'Pwp'.
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: You don't want to be called that.
The Welsh Party's AC said that the group as a whole was happy with the suggestion and had suggested other options.
Welsh Conservative said his group kept an open mind about the name change, but suggested there was not much difference between MWP and Muppet.
The ASC's Welsh translator is not that difficult.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce a change in name, said: "Of course, the matter for the members themselves will be the final decision on any descriptions to the titles of Assembly Members".
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found widespread support for calling the assembly in the Welsh Assembly.
As for the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of the Senedd Cymru (ASC) / Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but MWP came out stronger in the public consultation.
The ACU is reportedly suggesting other options, but the work of reaching consensus could be the death knell for the Prime Minister, Elin Jones, who is expected to table draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the scheme works, including rules on the non-applicability of Acts and the design of the committee system.
The Councils will have the final say on what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
The Republic of Macedonia votes in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This popular poem was created in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, a neighboring country with its own state called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbourhood represents a right to its territory.It has opposed the country's bids to join the EU and NATO.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on changing its name and has said he will reject the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a change of name is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Sounds Speaks as Churches in Harlem Facing Challenges
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I've talked to", Mr Adams said.
Today, one of them does.
He said it was understandable why the bars had disappeared.
"People socialize differently today", he says.
Bars are no longer considered to be communal living rooms where people go regularly.
As for churches, he worries that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to the same old situation.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominiums full of the kind of people who would not help the rest of the area's sanctuaries.
The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white, he says, which will mean that all these churches will close sooner because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of the churches.
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was turned over to a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the vendors on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's estate made plans for reconstruction, the bells were commissioned.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and a vicar at St Martin's church, was proud to give them the name 'the poor ears'.
The expert who sang the bells in July gave them another name: Cultural Treasure and unique historical offering.
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to sing larger bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church saw no one in his place.
What has happened at St Martin's in recent months has been a complex history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the church's lay leaders, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish - the governing body of the parish which includes lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to raise concerns that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the parish, although the parish had not been associated with the employment of the craftsmen and contractors the diocese had sent there.
Some plumbers complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy as he flies off to look for alligators in California
A 13-year-old boy was injured Saturday after being attacked by a shark while swimming in California to look for alligators, officials said, on the first day of the alligator season.
The attack happened just before 7am near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy crying for help.
Hammel said he thought the boy was excited to catch a chicken at first, but after reaching the boy, Hammel told him he noticed him shouting, "I've been married!
I've got my horse!
His shoulder was torn open.
I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a fish in the water,'" Hammel said.
The boy was lifted from the water in a helicopter and transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in critical condition.
We don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
In a press briefing, the lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim suffered injuries to the upper body.
Officers blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and investigative purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area but most of them are not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty balls in the form of ad hoc shops that include specialist assistants.
As part of an effort to reach the UK beauty market, a Â£2.8bn market which continues to grow despite declining sales of fashion and home goods, these larger-sized beauty products will be trialled in 11 stores across the country.
This investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use empty shelves after being competing for TV sets, microphones and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty products offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and branded areas similar to those you would see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique colour collection so that most products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, perfumery retailer The Fragrance Shop will trial concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people are shopping online and moving towards buying a little bit of food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discount stores, offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos keys in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat keys since it bought the two chains two years ago, which it says has strengthened food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and luxury departments failed.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended following a dispute over how to share the profits of pharmacy shops in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He said Lloyds would be part of the scheme as it would add an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty salons to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a vital beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is a wizard. Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a Â£11 million deal.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, was accused of having persuaded TV presenter Holly Willoughby to pull out of an Â£11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business, in order to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of accessories and home goods.
The pair's business had been compared to Paltrow's Gwyneth Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of the hosts of This Morning, had posted a message on Instagram announcing his departure.
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is in a bind after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new big contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was in a state of shock on Tuesday when the presenter admitted in a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to Â£1.5 million - meant she had little time left for Truly, their brand of accessories and home goods.
The business had been compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune, an estimated Â£11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This was her long-term future and the work she would have done over the next decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at headquarters in Marlow, and those are ready to be sold.
Experts believe this decision by one of Britain's most bankable stars could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products, including jewellery, candles, clothing and household goods.
It may also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We're not commenting on his business dealings".
It was a hard course and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making what some saw as an "un-presidential" comment, and for being so positive when speaking about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump lost so much?
Trump told four news anchors.
I didn't give up anything.
Kim said he was eager to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting that Trump described as a major step forward to denuclearizing North Korea.
However, the discussions on declassification have slowed down.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not believe the U.S. is responding in line with North Korea's early denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump was much more bold in his big speech.
We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results - he stopped rocket tests, helped clear the air and ensure the remaining American troops were returning home.
He went on to justify his unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Indonesian Earthquake Destroy Island, by the Village of Centuries
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, something that is necessary to catalyse international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging", Ms Sumbung said.
Although Arbed the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, they are not yet sure if foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be given support.
Because of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is not yet sufficiently prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other islands.
It appears that a tsunami warning was not issued in Palu, although a warning was issued, and that contributed to the death toll.
Travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship that had recently docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's resilient infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent loads of money on roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has been a thorn in Mr Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from long-standing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, spears and arrows, as well as other unconventional weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of the Liverpool team, scoring an equalising goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing a Premier League game to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was passed by Xherdan Shaqiri and was about 30 minutes from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
The ball bounced to the left before shooting towards the far post.
The ball rose high above the box as it moved towards the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball went down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and the ball landed in the net.
"I was trying to get in that position and get the ball and players like Shaq always play when they can, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.
I saw Kante come and checked the ball without thinking too much about it, just going for it.
At half-time, Chelsea were leading 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star of Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker passed the ball with his saddle back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the middle of the field and sprinting into half of Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a low-key kick and a quick pass in the middle of the field.
The ball then bounced forward skillfully between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard was a faster defender who passed the ball in the back pocket with a left-footed pass to Alisson Becker, one of the Liverpool players.
Liverpool play Napoli in a group stage match in the Premier League at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Total deaths following the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The total death toll following an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's agency for disasters said early Sunday morning.
Many people were recorded to be trapped amidst the rubble of buildings that collapsed when the 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, an earthquake that caused tremors as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered with rubble from buildings that were demolished.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Memedw, Dyffryn, earlier today.
A 44-year-old woman was found unconscious on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report if they have heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "Although this is just the beginning of the investigation, I would ask anyone who was in the John Street area of Memphis to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, have caught anything on dashboard gamers, they should contact us in case they have information that is essential to an investigation.
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Penedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to go back to his flat but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He had no words when he heard it happen.
The residents are now being told that they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed back in.
One of the police officers was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
The princess arrived at the site in her tears.
She keeps repeating this so terribly.
At 2pm there were two police stations in the cordon and one outside.
A number of officers stood in the corridor monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 indicating the record 247 30 September.
The Cromwell statue outside the Senedd is the latest monument to be part of the re-winding of history
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the devastation it caused to so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction wrought by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one of a conspiracy to try to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current discussion about the removal of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromell outside St Stephen's Palace would be demolished.
Cromwell was not responsible for the accomplishment or ordering of the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrait of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century thought and is part of a fictional history that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, more in the 19th century than perhaps today, regard Cromwell as a figure who protected the parliament from external pressure, the monarchy in his case.
We do not know whether this is true or not and there is an ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the turmoil of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our country and Cromwell is a single well-known figure representing one side of the debate.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are worth celebrating and remembering as well.
A Chinese Farmer's Car Crashes
A farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man, identified by his surname Yuan, was found dead near a pig's hide at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cow from the neighbouring state of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his wife found him dead and noticed that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big boar in the pit and blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had strangled a farmer to death, according to the report.
"The legs of my grandfather were torn and all blood", said the grandfather, who was called by his surname, Wu, according to a statement in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera video showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan Na's grandfather was not the animal that killed the man.
One of the market's managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the site.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although there are not many, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig held a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can cause them to behave like that.
They're being rude.
They're young, very curious... they don't mean you any harm.
You must show them proper respect, he said.
Tropical Storm Rosa is causing heavy rain over a large area of the southwestern United States.
The forecast indicates that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the western coast of Mexico.
However, Tropical Storm Rosa will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next several days.
Rosa had sustained winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, since 5am Eastern on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, the current will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical monsoon will then interact with the approaching monsoon causing heavy rain over the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous large floods, a rush of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical rainfall will cause rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of major flooding with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the precipitation nature of tropical rain.
It would be very dangerous to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall could cause the river to become wild and a storm of mud and hail will cause strong winds and dust explosions in the area.
The approaching storm will cause some local heavy rainfall in parts of the Southern California coast.
A total of more than half an inch of water may be dropped, which could cause minor rubble flooding and muddy roads.
This would be the first capture of the area during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical storms will begin to reach Arizona late on Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads further late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
Temperatures will change dramatically across the U.S. during October as the Arctic coast cools, but the tropics will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to significant changes in temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There are nearly 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what's left of the summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s, give evidence, on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, political discord continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular schedules to air the unexpected turn of events on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake stipulates that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain Kavanaugh had inappropriately touched her and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party, and he had been intoxicated.
Kavanaugh testified that he was absolutely sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company averaged the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To give perspective, the size of this audience was similar to an audience that would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel's opinion guests have given strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was much interest following the hearing as well.
Flake was the featured character in Friday's drama.
After Republican moderate officeholders declared that they would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning with protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into an elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood looking around the floor for a few minutes as he got a full head shot, live on television on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power and many girls are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filming live hours later, when it came time for the Legislative Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate allegations against the nominee by the following week, a result that minority Democrats have been pushing.
Flake was convicted in part after talking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British MEP May accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May has condemned those who criticise her plans to leave the European Union as playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interest.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the sidelines of his front page visit, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticised what he calls the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a ridiculous proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other.
Wayde Sims shooting case: Police arrest Dython Simpson on suspicion of killing one of the LSU players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the incident.
Police found a spectre on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS news reports WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing her.
He has a $350,000 fund, says a spokesman.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying that a gunshot wound to the head and neck caused the death.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked the local law enforcement team for their dedication and work to ensure justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six foot six inch forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was heartbroken and shocked to hear of Wayde's death.
This is the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
A firefighter hurls ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to go near the incinerator after the activity increased in the cave and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of eruptions and landslides.
Images on social media showed layers of mud covering the front windows of houses in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 kilometres (72 miles) southeast of the capital, since the September 2017 magnitude 7.1 earthquake that shook central Mexico.
The volcano is called 'Don Goyo' and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters ahead of the first anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined competitive protests to mark a year since Catalonia's split vote on secession.
A group of people in cots who were in favour of separating the riot police who held them back with eggs and powdered paint, created dark clouds of clay in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Later clashes also occurred during the day, with police using their batons to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Never forget, never forgive" and pro-independence protesters chanted "Here's to Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to local press.
Tensions remain high in this newly independent region, one year after an October 1 referendum which Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by Catalans who were supporters of independence.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but not many people turned out to vote and those opposed to secession had boycotted the vote substantially.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a national police protest.
The rebellion succeeded but forced him to follow another path.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was attending the protesters' protest with his wife, he was not opposed to further independence for Catalonia.
LATEST year, we had one of the best times ever.
I saw my parents crying with happiness when they were able to vote but we are back in the same old situation now, she said.
Despite a small but crucial victory in last December's regional elections, pro-independence groups have struggled to keep momentum going this year and many of the country's best-known leaders have either exiled themselves or are awaiting trial to help organise the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, politicians on both sides had been stirring up the waters during the riot.
"The feeling of malaise is increasing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would seek to stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Camping as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car driven into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after being driven into a house in Londonderry.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage had been done to the gates and to the building itself.
It is possible that a crossbow was also fired at the car.
The result was a 1-0 win for Livingston against Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures a win for Livingston
Livingston shocked Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to miss the final in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's throw was the difference as Gary Holt's team lifted to Hibernian's level in a second.
Gerrard's side have not won a home game in the Premier League this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, who are on top and eight points clear of the top two.
Before that, Rangers will host a match against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has won six consecutive games in the lower division, and head coach Holt has not missed a game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's losing chances against the visitors
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored and their direct nature was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort was pushed across the surface of the ball, then Alan Lithgow could not but cancel his effort wide after slipping to meet the penalty Craig Halkett across the ball,
The home team were content to let the Rangers play from the front, knowing that they could cause difficulties for others in certain areas.
And that's how the crucial back was found.
The Rangers returned a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to assist Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the centre of the box.
By then, the Rangers were controlling possession of the ball but could not break through the home team's defenses and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not worried much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was refused by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from another set played by Livingston.
Crusaders came to Livingston's fox constantly and continued to be cleared, and two rights to a penalty kick - after Halkett challenged the player's reserve, Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were denied.
A stunning performance by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland analysts at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and outcome for Livingston.
They were great and continue to raise expectations on this path that has been climbed.
Their style of play and personnel have not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be commended for the way he has motivated the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, putting together a very well-ordered defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
But the Rangers had little spirit.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard, their standards were not seen.
They had a great grip on their last ball - they only opened the home side once - and it was a bit of a warning for the Rangers, who are now mid-table.
Erdogan's mixed reception in Cologne
There was a lot of fresh air and smiles on Saturday (May 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to try to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police had given security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters had come near the mosque to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them in Georgia - made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These cornish protests reflect the rift associated with the visitor, a man considered a hero by some German Turks and an autocrat by others.
Car crash in Deptford: Rider killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened a few months after another motorcyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Road closures and diversions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Lartin Ship Prison: Six officers have been injured in a fire
Six officers have been injured in an ambush at a men's high security prison, according to the Prison Office.
The incident took place at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case is ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the incident, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in a single wing.
The minor injuries sustained by the officers on their faces were treated on site.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specialist trained prison staff have gone there to deal with this ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison.
His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison contains more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the governor of the prison had been hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, counter-terrorism officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious incident where staff were attacked with a bowling ball.
Hurricane Rosa in the eye of major flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dry Elwa Area Channel)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to be early next week as the remnants of Tropical Storm Rosa move across the desert southwest, creating a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will be watching for major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning right late Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained storm status or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of AZ's borders.
The latest models of the National Center on Aging predict between 2 and 4 inches of hand, with some rare example of a total length of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mountains Edge.
Other areas in the Southwest of the Desert including the Great Basin and the central Rockies are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with some cases of a total of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, Rosa rain can be beneficial to them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because there are dry conditions in the South-West at the moment.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the highest category but one, weather.com said.
Initially, the Rosa trail will lead to land along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, which was still as strong as the Sunday morning wind with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is reaching the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean so it is weakening.
Because of this, the storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength by late afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing significant flooding risk.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Rosa then travels northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low pressure storm, which then travels up through Arizona and southern Utah, arriving late on Tuesday night.
The main danger that is expected due to Rosa or the remnants of the storm is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. states, the National Center for Tropical Diseases said.
This rain is expected to create major floods that can threaten lives as well as a flood of rubble in the desert and landslides on mountainous land.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found strangled in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officers have asked anyone with a record of what happened on their mobile phone to provide that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered at the hands of the Democratic Party's anger and aggression.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's uncouth and disgraceful tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the Democratic Party's backlash and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was silenced in his denial of the allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were both in their twenties.
Ford testified at the hearing for his allegation as well.
The President said Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's brilliance and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking of the importance of the Republican convention in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not trying to, but I'm really trying", he said.
That's why I go everywhere trying to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to resist and impede.
The first key legislative vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and numbers are increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them drowned as huge boats crashed on the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres hit the beach late at night, scooping many away and killing and destroying anything along the path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they didn't run away immediately and became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it was sweeping away cars, cottages, houses, it was hitting everything on land, " said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 knots (497 m) before hitting the beach.
Some climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had collapsed and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The coastal city was still rocked by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "a single blaze" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"There was no way to communicate with Donggala to get information", Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but the situation could get worse", he said.
The agency was sharply criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived in time for the warning.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man can be heard on the ground floor shouting at people in the street below, warning them that a tsunami is on its way.
Within minutes, a flood of water swept over the lake, carrying away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around SÃ£o Paulo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but those who have been forced to flee their homes are in desperate need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to go to the rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
It is a Terrible Situation.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala had reached Palu city safely, where the workers were sheltering in tarpolin shelters installed in their office yard, they had passed some torchlight scenes on the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups began the unhindered process of delivering emergency aid, some have complained that skilled foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, no funding, supplies or staff can be provided unless the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a tragedy at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster, we can get international help, but there's no status yet.'
As the night wore on in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hoped that their loved ones were alive by some miracle, which would alleviate some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from a carjacking.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to free a woman who had been trapped under a rope for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesia national paragliding team, had trained two male paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said his students were among those stranded at the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone who has experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional cat", he said.
In the hours after the community had barely heard the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr Gendon said he had sent a number of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his messages were accompanied by only one shiny tick, rather than two dark ones.
"I think that means that the messages have not been sent", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as an ATM machine gets refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from one of Brink's employees who was refilling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been blowing up an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man ran from behind the Brink employee and carried a bag of money that was to be provided.
Witnesses saw many other people fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on who these people are should contact Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name from  to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used the name as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his album, Yandhi.
She will be replacing Ariana Grande, the American singer who pulled out due to emotional reasons, according to the show's creators.
As well as being a candidate for his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'God' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'God,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, which he presented on the radio.
So you are, we are, we are.
The name went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye only  reflecting the good, the bad and the ugly, everything.
Our album does more than reflect who we are.
Among the many other famous rappers who have changed their names are.
Combs has had various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to collaborate with West, has also been using his name as his variation on the ending of all the prefixes.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use soldiers against civilians
Mexico's future President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody massacre of students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to never use the military to defeat the Mexican people.
He shot at soldiers during a peaceful protest at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing nearly 300 people, as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexico's youth by giving grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are lured into gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the money it spends on research in the field, said artificial intelligence investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow various departments of the US government making announcements regarding artificial intelligence, although the US does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy in general.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, which aims to be the best country in all innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the funding for AI research would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are much less developed than the US, and we are looking for the next big discovery in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence is achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published his book "Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that made the best Othello player in America. He later became an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that steals the academic leaders; it is the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been trying to recruit bright alumni from universities to work on artificial intelligence recently.
Also, Lee said that changes to the immigration policy could help the US to reinforce its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe green cards should be offered automatically to people with expertise in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government institutions fund researchers from the USA, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence is being formed.
Earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in force for months.
Macedonian citizens vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose name is Macedonia, claims that its false name represents a claim to its territory and has prevented the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO or the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece?
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the fall of Yugoslavia, to have access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
'I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because it will ensure safer lives for all of us,' said Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, many members of the assembly have said they will wait for the result of the vote to make it a definite vote.
A name change would require a two-thirds majority in the senate.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of any irregularities by 1pm.
However, only 16 percent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
I have come to vote because of my child, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, a change that would allow the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of a tent set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the door of the servants", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a member of NATO will ensure the investment that Macedonia really needs, a country whose unemployment rate is above 20 per cent.
I believe that the vast majority will be from parties because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said the outcome would "strengthen our future".
According to a poll conducted last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for a party.
For the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, passes all the Brighton defenders and get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling knock out Brighton's defenders during Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made that look awfully easy as he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker was caught in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green circles.
One defender shot away before running faster than many others on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then passed to his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England striker used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We had discussed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at that time.
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton district that time.
He gave a beautiful kick through the players all over the backfield to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before Sterling pointed around a further post.
The Chelsea forward kicked the ball into the net before it slipped over the boundary.
Manchester City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals having no hope of competing in the second chance games, there's not much reason to force another starter.
Scherzer hopes to be on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in terms of second-round games for the Rockies, who have saved the Los Angeles Dodgers by one in the NL West.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to secure their spot in the first group.
Even if we're not playing for nothing, at least we can turn the corner knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with our crowd in Denver and that the other team will be playing at the highest level that we'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a game like that?
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they are rumoured to be keen to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would have missed his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallying in Northern Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and he spoke of the importance of the Assembly of the Republic in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be in the fountain in November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big ones, big ones - I don't apply but I really apply, that's why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates", she said.
Trump went ahead of him, and you see this terrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back by any means necessary, you see the aggression, the evil.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they have to bully to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are trying to resist and prevent.
"And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "foolish and cruel and unpopular and dishonest".
He referred to the name of the senior Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a loud roar was heard among the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a second -- that was an example of bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a popular party.
The party does not support those who say they do.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to expel me, it was a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest of many Labour MPs to have heard that we are not welcome - and that is to say that we are.
My congressional colleague, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for standing up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the suggestion of a strike was to dissuade me from agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Disagree with him on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are the same issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the East Nottingham Works meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in most of our meetings today and we have long forgotten the promise of a more loving, more compassionate politics, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour party and that each view is judged on the basis of its acceptability to the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader.Co-workers who I used to think were of the same political persuasion as me started expecting me to make a stand and support views I would never have agreed with otherwise - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I actually say - it leads to fierce attacks on social media calling for my not being elected, condemning centre-right politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professional and decisive nature of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but do not let it get the better of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not such a broad-minded party now and with every attempt to shore up confidence or change the selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to push my judgment too far, then I'll be a fool.
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, disgusted by the disregard of the Thatcher government, which was responsible for the dismal state of my entire school classroom, and since then I have sought to promote better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political views and the areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader with the country moving towards Brexit which will be a blow to households, businesses and public services.
But, in fact, it's not a message to Momentum Nottingham that I have, but a message to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from my nationality or political convenience will prevent me from acting in the way that I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is unlucky on the summit
Two late applications may have had some impact on the final result, but it is clear that Ayr deserves to win this Premier League Tennent game.
They are now top of the table, the only team to have never been beaten by a tenth.
In the end, their excellent defence, as well as their exploits, were responsible for keeping the home team going and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We have had challenging games so far, but no one has beaten us, so I have to be content", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr should be praised, they took better chances than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card of Scotland's Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, meant that Melrose could take advantage of that and scored an untouched goal from Jason Baggot.
Climo ensured Ayr was more than ever ahead with a penalty kick, before he, just before half-time, scored and converted a single goal to secure a 17-5 score to Ayr in the corner.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson, who was substituted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a delay because Knott's riding was seriously injured, and he was carried away on a stretcher. After they resumed, Ayr had more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and yet Melrose paid the extra player with an unconverted shot by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of furious pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from a penalty kick line, MacPherson put the ball down behind Ayr's increasingly sharp back.
Climo turned the ball over, as he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's fox tick and sent forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's five-ball pitch.
Seren Still Game is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, one of the stars of Still Game, hopes to move into the hospitality industry after he discovers he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, alongside writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The twins have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show's history and Kiernan is presumably planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but one of the Scottish Sun sources suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of a thriving Glasgow restaurant chain.
No sea: Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of a regimental ship in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a blue flag like the sea.
Maritime centres from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: "We are the masters of the sea by right".
It is his duty to restore it.
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the loss to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century still lives - as does the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are brighter than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and it is understandably frustrated waiting for the result", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the international court's ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim - after decades of contentious talks - that Chile must negotiate a maritime opening to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic and proud president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - is heavily dependent on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of August.
But some analysts do not believe the court is likely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and it would not change much if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate the Chilean territory, and has insisted it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the international court of justice's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not a complex one, said Paz ZÃ¡rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than improving the Bolivian case, the last four years may have made it worse.
"The current Bolivian administration has been very active on this issue of access to the sea", ZÃ¡rate said.
Morales's belligerent strategy has undermined any goodwill Chile had left behind, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo RodrÃ­guez VeltzÃ©, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process is usually a quick process.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of ties with Chile and to end 139 years of disagreement over cultural interests, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Marales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders - was using the maritime issue as a political bagel.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to realise that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says it won't give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not give up its nuclear weapons unless the trusted member in Washington first does so.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the US to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit between the countries' leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming nuclear diplomacy that would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the idea that continued sanctions and US opposition to ending the Korean War will make the North give up is just a pipe dream.
Washington is unlikely to agree to the declaration before Pyongyang makes significant disarmament moves first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are due to hold a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons which most countries, more than likely, see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the latest collection of giant headwear is about to reach your high street
If you want a different hat or if you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of massive and striking headwear for their SS19 fashion collection, which was shining on the fashion set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the incredible creations of these designers have been spotted on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was a velvet hat over a plaid top with a plush border covering the heads of the models.
Among the other large accessories were watermelons decorated with gems, a wine hat and even a pencil - but these hats would not warm your head.
Thom Browne revealed a collection of strange beetles too - and that just in time for the Winter Solstice.
Many of the colorful beasts had teeth sewn together and were more like Hannibal Lecter than a hermit's beard.
One of them was like a squash-paddle with snorcel and glasses, and the other looked like a cone of ivory, and that one had melted.
And if you like big fashion reveals - here's your chance.
Those who keep watch over the stele anticipate that giant bonnets may be coming to your high street.
These large hats follow the style of "La Bomba", the popular two-foot wide-brimmed grass hats, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these unusual hats seen on social media also had another big creation on the fashion stage - a green bag almost as big as the swimsuit model she was carrying.
The bright orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia border and a white leather handles, was one of the most striking items in the collection of La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big beach hats and bags hit the high street next summer - with the designer having made such an impression, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the examinations, but this is only supported by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a leading school curriculum, we see modern languages as a popular subject to choose in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it will stick in his memory.
If you speak to a person in his own language, it stays in his heart.
This is a powerful message to remind us that we cannot rely on English alone when seeking to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the charts and include the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages have obtained a high A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72 per cent of pupils achieved an A-level in Mandarin, and that 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish achieved A-levels.
This shows that independent schools in Albania are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages are now treated as subjects in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17% of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is a growing demand for languages to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities being proposed requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
Whatever career one chooses, if one has learned a second language, one will have a real advantage in the future of having such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will be a step ahead straight away.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will have different languages to teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but others will teach languages considered most important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages from which to choose in independent schools, and the schools will have teaching staff specialised in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare their pupils with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their challenges.
It is undeniable that in a global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
The clock is ticking.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the season opener Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play again.
"It's going to be more than one but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers coach Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely James would play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
The time of the West Virginia Trump Rally, YouTube Channel
President Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is trying to rally support for the midterm elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings on his nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is under strain as allegations of sexual misconduct with a congressionally confirmed voter have been delayed for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the rally series is to help Republicans facing tough elections in November gain some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week would aim to galvanize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and add to their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as he begins the important campaign term", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state that gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come here to try to put him in the pillory", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show the block to fight on as they head to Sunday's singles matches
After three one-legged sessions, a four-legged Saturday afternoon might be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been imagined in the world of sport but is a concept that players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say is the momentum right now?
"They were six points ahead and now there are four, so we have a bit of momentum for sure", said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the table with another eighteen to play for.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails and they have plenty of encouragement, especially with Speith and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and have scored three out of four.
Speith has been a great leader in the field and leads by example.
The shouts of celebration went higher as the first round went ahead, succeeding with a crucial shot to go on a four-all match despite him and Thomas having been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the game that won them the 15th, the kind of scream that tells you that they don't believe America is out of the woods again.
"You have to be focused and worry about your own health", Speith said.
This is the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
A couple of us have just loved Europe four by four and they're doing nothing wrong.
Mollywood was the only bar not to have a Saturday afternoon bar, and they had no Saturday morning bar on Friday afternoon or the last nine of Friday morning.
That run, and the way the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that the same player would be more popular to secure a European victory in claiming the right to bat over Le Golf National than Fleetwood Molinari.
If possible both on the same price on different designs.
But it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning's top four, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
After two doubles and two singles in the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede were in a hole from which they never came close to emerging.
But on the Sabbath, no one is to help you out of your pit.
There are four balls and four squares that I find interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
So far Europe have played better as a team and they are leading by a margin at the start of the final day, but the quarter-final session has proven that Team USA have the ability to fight back, something that some in the USA in particular doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and penalty shootout 10-6 ahead of the USA.
The incredible duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to go from a score so far in Le Golf National to four points.
European star Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to regain the title after losing it at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning's four balls to take the series 3-1.
The USA put up more opposition in the quarterfinals, but they couldn't eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the title.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, who have been dubbed "Molliwood" after an incredible weekend, are the second to score four points from four consecutive victories in Ryder Cup history.
After matching Woods and Patrick Reed on all four balls they teamed up brilliantly to beat Woods on American rookie Bryson Startambeau from 5 and 4.
Wood, who scored two goals on Saturday, has missed 19 of 29 matches in four games and seven quarters in a row.
Justin Rose, out of the running for the morning fours, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who were first and third in the world by 2 and 1.
Everything went wrong for Europe on a nice, sunny day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later defeated Polter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the quarter-finals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from being four points behind at the start of individual matches, although a tie score is all that is needed on the Furyk team as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming to their rescue on Sunday looked like it was beyond their ability.
North Korea says they won't disarm unless there's trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions are reinforcing misunderstandings in the US and that the country will not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill steps" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile exercises, decommissioning a nuclear test site, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But we don't see such a response from the USA", he said.
Without trust in the US there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot un-assure ourselves first.
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's direct complaints about Washington's refusal of a gradual response to denuclearization rather than North Korea being rewarded with gradual steps, his statement was to be seen as significant as he did not reject denuclearization altogether as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and North Korean adversary in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula while Trump promised to guarantee the security of Korea.
North Korea has been trying to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to relax the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is insisting on denuclearisation first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even opposes the declaration to end the war, RI said.
The idea that sanctions can overwhelm us is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions reinforce our suspicion.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a summit the president had called at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of denuclearisation and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not lead to such an impossible situation".
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that a US targeting of North Korea with rockets was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a "rocket on a self-defeating target".
At the United Nations last year, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must wait until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific timeline for this, saying whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN General Assembly on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must be strictly and unreservedly enforced until we have achieved and confirmed complete denuclearisation".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to limit funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Ri met Pompeo on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been progress, but that North Korea accused him within hours of making "gangster-like statements".
North Korea has promised to meet Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and nuclear site if the U.S. takes equivalent steps.
He said Kim had told him that the Cyphatebollah measures he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump had endorsed in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with the US.
Harvard students are getting a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting undergraduates to sleep more in an attempt to tackle the macho culture of studying through the night using caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's best universities often get confused when they have to reverse the fundamentals of their own learning.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who designed the course, believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
The course was initially inspired by a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why is it that I only know this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep - which was surprising to me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being introduced for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course still consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleeping habits.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
We are aware that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we feel that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what smoking does to your health", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressures on students mean that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse.
Getting enough sleep, and quality sleep, should be a way for students to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says -- even to avoid putting on weight, because lack of sleep makes the brain believe that you're sleeping, making you sleepy all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of last year's courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to seek the course for the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, together and for waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue lights emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can affect your circadian rhythms leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal by Menga beating Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor away game as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's untouchable team at Livingstone.
Ibrox were looking for their first road win since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's Gerrard's side beat them for only the second time in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind top-flight leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers team were short of spirit and no eye for equalising.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone rises to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the Welshman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after something was thrown off the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight substitutions for the team that led Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 and beat Hearts last week and would have loved the way his orderly squad overpowered their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone made more of a buck when she had them.
They should have scored after only two minutes after the Menga base gave Scott Pittman a chance on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder's chance was cleared by hitting the ball.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs caught captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit a clear shot at the back post.
The Rangers were in control but there was more hope than belief in their play in the last quarter of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a shot of the cigarette less than a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless had struck but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombiad's appeals.
Rangers had two shots on target in the first half but were held out before Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's penalty and Ovie Ejaria's throw.
Although Livi's goal in the 34th minute was against the pace of the game, no one can argue that they didn't deserve it for their hard work alone.
Yet, the Rangers' method is to deal with Jacobs' deep play plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was stunned as he passed it to Menga for an easy pass.
Gerrard was a brake as he switched Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change almost had an immediate impact as the striker passed to Morelos but Kelly crossed the line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving long balls after long balls.
Holt's car could have added to their score in the last few minutes but McGregor raised well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow missed a penalty from a corner.
Rangers forward Glenn Middleton had another request for a kick from the goal after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson refused the request again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in CYFRIC... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, a development that would eventually lead to the invention of the Geiger Measure.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger counter became an important part of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: What in the world is this?
Rogers: Geiger counter, used to find subatomic particles, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms being released by the radiation in the mines.
Evan: Hey, it's making a little bit of a noise!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of treatment
This method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and then modifying them in a laboratory.
They'll then be able to see a protein that's common in many cancers and they'll be re-injected.
A test of the vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect a protein called HER2 that is common in several cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 causes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked to treat some types of leukaemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAGA cap.
She did not well
Kanye West was fired from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a heart-wrenching performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the Presidency in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again jacket, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support of Trump.
I'm going to talk to a white person and they're going to say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
Well, if I was worried about my survival I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a Matt Damon-starring sketch where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not air, a video of West performing the song was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to blackmail West by his post.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been beaten up behind a stage for what he was wearing on his head.
They were watching me from behind the stage.
They said, "He will go out with a whip and then with a crown".
They were molesting me!
Then they say I'm in a low place, he says, then after the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that he would put my Superman cousin on, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
The love triangle.
His comments were booed at least twice by the SNL audience and cast members were eager to see it, Variety reported, but one person told the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West had been added as a late addition to the Ariana Grande roster, as his former love rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West caused a stir by performing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who said: "I am one of the characters of the play: I have never seen a good movie".
But the presenter, Karen Hunter West, insisted that West was just being himself and that was great.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I feel embraces and expresses ideas that are harmful to my community.
I'm free.
And so are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper, Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince changed his name to symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
A suspect is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Seren of Game of Thrones Kit Harington is killed by a poisonous snake
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy-thriller series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed off the macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on screen mean young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something had gone wrong and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he felt strongly about tackling the problem.
I feel strong for the moment - what has gone wrong with the witnesses? he said.
What have we been teaching men as they've grown up, in terms of the problem we have now?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in violent crime and that it is because of the very masculine characters.
He went before him: What is wise and what is learned?
What is it that is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel that they must be a special kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong with young men.
In the interview he admitted that he would not do any more Game of Thrones programmes when the series ends next summer, saying he had had enough of battles and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
Recently the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing he remembered from Game of Thrones.
"I met a woman on the show, so in a way she gave me my family, and my life from now on", she says.
Rose played the role of Cat, Jon Snow's love interest, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
Around 40,000 new cases were identified in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of these cases were transmitted sexually, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood supplies.
But the number of people who are infected with HIV like this has been reduced to almost nothing, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But, year by year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HICV is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly rampant.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the infections are transmitted as a result of unsafe sex in these settings.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has released the data of Republican senators, blaming it on "dangerous conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were being spread by far-right Canadian bandits.
"Lies, lies, and more lies", Walters said in a statement to Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState published that the IP address indicating the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and they released information of a Waters staff member, the Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is false and a blatant lie", Waters said later.
The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is not in any way responsible for the release of this information.
This baseless accusation is false and an outright lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This sentence is boring", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that he does not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they don't get mad.
They don't seem to be challenging.
They do not question the motives of the perpetrator.
They must be quiet and unmoved.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was attacked by judges who appeared to be angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also weighed in on Twitter.
"I wonder if it's true", he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the offenders are exposed", he said, "and that they are held accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all my staff".
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - parody of the spy with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British slant and it is seen as appropriate for this revival of the comedy parody series Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Or self-righteous tongue in the poor on what sour we will not be able to export the new nation?
However, the handsome Johnny English has been allowed to ruin everything for the second time - with his name more than indicating that he is a comic character created for cinema audiences in non-English speaking countries.
Of course this is the real spy who despite his heinous claims includes a bit of Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one point to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally based on the mysterious traveller and man Atkinson played in Barclaycard advertising, leaving a ruined legacy.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved watching Johnny English go for a helmet wearing armor and the rotor lips hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent with physical comedy is evident, but his humor is weak and strangely redundant, especially now that action films such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of films.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the Johnny English male anthems aren't as clever and specific as Atkinson's tail jokes in Bean's character.
The prevailing idea is that Great Britain is in big trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identities of all the British spies in the field, in order to protect a secret agent on duty - the unfortunate and small Kevin Eldon.
This is the final stage for a self-righteous and self-centered prime minister, who is already suffering from enormous political bias.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all detectives have been compromised and that she will be forced to come and someone out of retirement.
And this includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in some kind of institution, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English runs a spy school similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is cast.
So Batman and Robin are about to get things wrong again at the service of His Majesty, stumbling across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being wooed by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to deal with British computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hilarious journey: dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; create a scene while trying to board a steam-powered Volta ship; and English causes complete disorder when trying to use a Rhodey-style tool to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house
They make a very show of it in the last scene, but as funny and unreal as it is, there's a little bit of a child-television feel to the whole thing.
Very good.
And like all the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes him play with his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a plan for the British people to work four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical scheme that would mean that British people work a four-day week - but are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to their workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would mean that workers would have a three-day weekend - but receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country away from the workers.
The change to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but a four-day week is an ambition that is in line with the party's approach to restructuring the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present the ambition is not endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's party conference to expand his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from the directors and profits of the public resource companies.
The opposition's shadow plans also mean that existing shareholders of water companies will not be fully reimbursed as the Labour government could make decisions based on apparent misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and created Comprehensive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of companies' equity; the private sector would hold workers, who would receive annual instalments of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican lawmakers to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said before the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, after the allegations came out, I said, 'You're going to do this?'
He was firm, decisive and unflinching.
However, Graham's plea is seen as firm.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a terrible charge", he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett was in total denial", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one can confirm it by name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the World Citizenship Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizenship Festival, an annual music event with an impressive line-up of stars and an equally compelling message: end poverty worldwide.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people descend upon the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the festival's main goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) our visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else of value to help raise awareness of our poverty eradication goals.
But how successful has the World Book Festival been with only 12 years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free love a good way to persuade people to want change or just another case of "clicktivism" - people feeling that they are making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a donation?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from actions, with at least $10 billion of it classified as or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and operators committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 47,00 donations from Global Citizens.
'With the support of the UK government, stakeholders, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a footnote in history,' said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after over 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
The Global Citizenship Festival replied: It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle MonÃ¡e are among some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy for quartering to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may need to use the Navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - in particular, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - prompted him to explore renewable energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal in energy as they do in Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe", he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways to address this.
"The United States has the ability, with the UK, to make sure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to put in place safeguards, to make sure that their fish do not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was greeting the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the US.
He proceeded to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and replace fuel", he said, noting that Russia's economy is entirely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
Meanwhile, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a rival to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is an economic project and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion we share the belief that energy cannot be used to impose pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's decision has attracted a strong response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be considered a candidate for the presidency in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would be hard-pressed to run for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will consider hard to apply for the leadership.
Warren gave his opinion of Donald Trump at the town meeting, saying he was steering the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", he said.
Warren has been unflinching on language in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a speech on Friday, Warren said that of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts likely voters said the senator should not stand behind the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center's poll.
Thirty-two per cent supported such an effort.
The polling polls showed much more support for the bid by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible bid and 48 percent against.
Other Democratic names that have been mentioned as possible 2020 candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through coming back, I can sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the trauma that some of our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an elephant in the room and said about his son and other former soldiers, they come back different, they come back stronger and they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the armed forces have given to our country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska on charges of assaulting a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a challenge to the new shelter policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. made a friend-of-the-court presentation Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, was not disclosed.
He said his partner and two violent gang members had been beaten but U.S. officials denied his request for a divorce on July 20.
He was kept in custody in Nexas.
The tourney of Grace's supporting countries El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the U.S., were described as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum if they were fleeing domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that any application for a pardon be adjudicated on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a barrier is contrary to that principle", the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The tournament further argued that the policy of barring immigrants from entering the US is damaging the US economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and to provide needed labour.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges not give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said when announcing the policy on 11 June.
Refugees are not immune to the problems - even the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly critical.
"I feel very worried", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her sick son at a migration centre in the city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance comes and a body is brought in.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which had been devastated by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were filled.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where they were being treated outdoors due to severe post-traumatic stress.
Tears came to his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of an earthquake shaking the fifth-floor room of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to save ourselves.
I got pushed to the walls, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then you shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda ads
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the US promoting trade benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the addition of the China Daily to the Des Moines Register - the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in US congressional elections on November 6, accusations that China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections was a new step in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to set up trade-promoting notices, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, experts from the US and China said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote, "China is now confirming that bullying by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
On the contrary, in the newspaper stalls down the street here in Beijing, you would find it hard to find contradictory voices and you would not see a very reflective reflection of the various ideas that the Chinese people have about China's worrisome economic path, as the press under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had declined the offer to publish his article, though he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn Republicans Excluded Women Voting Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh's Placements
As many progressive Republicans support the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about this have been very high, and a majority of Republicans on record already say they want to go ahead with the ballot.
You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (G-Arizona) 's last-minute attempt to get an FBI investigation would be enough to discourage unhappy voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the pioneering group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate chamber as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to be tremendous", Stu Rothenburg, a political analyst for the Independent, told the news website.
People say they're already enthusiastic; that's true.
But it could increase, especially among insecure women on the outskirts of towns and among young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who although they do not like our president often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court nomination, analysis suggested that there would be a strong reaction if Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed into a complete plague of Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and the way they have dealt with it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided on who to blame following the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a slightly more cautious Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov opinion survey shows that 41% of respondents strongly or strongly disagree with Ford's testimony, while 35% say they strongly or strongly disagree with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed it was certain or likely that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's campaign, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford along with at least one other suspect, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified on the Senate Judiciary Committee's doorstep last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, sexually harassed her while they were at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology pioneer's new project, Inrupt, is a company building on the open source platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose in the cloud what their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In a selection interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated that the Inrupt company's intention was to control the world.
"We have to do it now", he said of the company.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all on one browser and connected at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user who is seeing what kind of information.
The company calls it data-driven personal authentication.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help ensure that Solid is accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own dedicated apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team are talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are being overhauled overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and ecosystem power to help safeguard the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the multilateralism of the Internet.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Institute.
'I am very optimistic about this next week in the history of the web,' added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victoria Cross clergyman of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a combatant in the First World War has been commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
The Honourable Bernard Vanny won the award on 29 September 1918 in the assault on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by her two husbands in a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was highly symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the game that won the prize for his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 the Vann Submarine led her fatalities across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through thick fog and attacks by field guns and machine guns.
Later he rushed to the line of the dance and with the greatest courage led the line forward before running to the field alone and defeating three of the crew.
Lt. Gen. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father's actions were something I could only compare to but were demeaning to someone.
He helped Doctor James Vann's brother lay a torch after the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very proud to be part of the expedition adding that true heroism is shown by the support given by so many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, they had Peppa Pink in his place
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206 only to be banned from the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 horns, including a cheek on the main card and was shown live by the UK's Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to face each other, the viewers in the UK were left in shock as the screen changed to Peppa Pink.
Some were unhappy to stay up all night especially to watch the fireworks.
One Twitter fan described the change to a children's playground as "some kind of sick joke".
"Government regulations said that content was not suitable after 6am so we had to switch to children's programmes", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepper is a pig, yes".
Scott Coker, Bellator's president, said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when we think about the re-expression, we can make it work", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to deal with this until it's our Sunday time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the problem, it was a matter of governance.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five corners instead of six - as is usual - we tried to give too much to our fans and it was a long ride.
It's a sad situation.
Tom Daley felt undervalued because of his sexuality
The actor Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he didn't realise until he got into high school that everyone was like me.
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs to be hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was speaking about gay rights in order to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first programme, Daley said that she felt like she was better than everyone else growing up but that it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said: "Even today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He said this to test himself, so that his going unnoticed might not be embarrassed.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist who used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to end the treatment of homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was unexpected.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, last year but said the age gap had never been a problem.
'When someone goes through so much at such a young age' he went to his first Olympic Games in '14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had lived through similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his perspective had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
But there are bigger things than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
He has a son with the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 yet - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be around to be in the front row either", she said.
I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and was dead did I recognize that he was not unconscious, he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to play in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she said.
He also inspired his first choice song - Proud by Heather Small - which had been sung since before the Olympics and still gave him a tear.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who's not at his best on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate touchdown.
Mickelson, playing in the biannual event for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the four-point and four-quarter games.
Rather than being in the center of the action, as has been so often in the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, divided his day between being a fan and working on his game in the hope of improving his problems.
With no driver's thirst even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a good choice for the Le Golf National, where a long, hard drive punishes a round shot.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in the ninth game on Sunday faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12th game, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, although he could do no other.
"He understood the role he had today, he put his arm around my back and took his arm off my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't see him playing two games.
I had expected more, but then it worked out and then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everybody else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk says his presence is an insignificant boost to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people, he's a great person to have in the team room", she explained.
I think the young players had fun making fun of himself too, this week, was nice to see him.
It contributes much more than just a few.
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great fortune can vanish quickly
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that a big bonus before the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish team played its first match in Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage was down to three points with Europe winning by 141â2 to 131â2.
"Remind yourselves that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we lost but a little bit of lead", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You must try your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the cup, and that's where we'll be focusing.
I've said from the start, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what's at the back of the eight - the best players in the world.
He was delighted with the way his players had performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: 'I will never be proud of this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the solo performances will come first, and that's something completely different to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're being tested quite a lot as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be given to the players, that you have to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too.
Unlike Bjorn, the Americans' captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the big wins on the final day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing back to Europe to secure the 'Wirth in Medinah'.
"I remember every word of it", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had given his players a point before the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When the momentum is going in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those balls in the middle.
We set our line up and give the men out as we want, we try to do something amazing tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the field.
"I joined this group of players in this order because I think they will work well all the way", Bjorn said of his choice for the individual games.
The New German War Ship has been delayed once again
Germany's new frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit referring to a spokesman on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that were commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are rumored to include powerful guns, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles along with some stealth technologies, such as radar signature, sub-orbital and low-pitched sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - new frigates should be able to be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
But continued delays mean that the pioneering warships - which will allow Germany to project its power over the sea - will be over by the time they enter service, said Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate was in the news last year, after the German Navy refused to commission the ship and it returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to shipbuilders after it had been delivered.
The reasons behind the ship's return were not clear, but German media pointed to a number of critical software and hardware deficiencies that meant the ship was a good-for-nothing ship if she had to fight.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen-class ships.
It also became clear that the ship was overloaded which was deteriorating its performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be 7,000 tons twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the inadequate hardware, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the crew - is becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached â¬3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from â¬2.2billion initially.
The problems of the new fringes become ever more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy was running out of traceable vessels.
The official said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships being supplied in their place.
It was decided that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the hidden lives of the poor
New research is underway in Upper Scotland to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique mammals and help with future conservation activities.
The study by National Trust of Scotland scientists will follow the common least squid on the soprano squid along with longfin squid and water squid at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the site to keep an eye on the activity of the floods throughout the season.
Volunteers and staff from the NHS will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held sensors.
Specialist sound analysis of the recordings will reveal the frequency of the calls of the reptiles and which species are doing what.
A report and a population map are then produced to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser to the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to the islands and how they are used by each species.
The information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating forests and how to manage forests for algae and other related species.
Populations of the tick in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their habitats and leads to habitat loss.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be hazardous, along with insect-catching paper and some chemicals in building materials, and cat attacks.
The foolish are not wise.
But because they are nocturnal, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to spot insects and obstacles in front of them.
The National Trust for Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and is very concerned about the pests.
They have ten trained specialists, who carry out regular inspections, visits to nests and occasional rescues.
The organisation has established Scotland's first turtle sanctuary on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of turtle.
The manager of the station David Thompson said that the layout of the station was perfect for them.
Here in Threave we have a great area for the deer", he said.
We have many old buildings, many old trees and a good environment.
But there is a lot we don't know about immigration, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what it takes to make a man thrive.
It emphasises the search for lice before undertaking any maintenance work in buildings as one fatal fire could destroy up to 400 female and young lice, potentially killing the entire local population.
Snakes are protected and it is illegal to kill, torment or harm them or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Environment Protection Trust, has been urging the public to lend a hand.
He said: 'We have so much to learn about our wetlands and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo denies abuse charges as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German journalist.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him false news, saying people were trying to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American princess, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. You're not going to get it.
What they said today was fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's not unusual.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine,' added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called unacceptable speeches of suspicion in a private matter, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for a moral penalty of an amount commensurate with the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights offences in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are ordered to return to the player's room, where he made his routine sex, according to papers filed with the Clark County Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his tracks after the alleged incident and told her that he was a good kid who was being disappointed by the youngster.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of retribution and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continues to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack happened, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for â¬100 million.
Brexit: The UK would regret losing car makers for ever
The UK would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world's leading car producer after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would temporarily stop producing cars at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need an agreement", said Mr Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said that delays at the border could lead to job losses if there was a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, almost 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain were to fall out of the EU at the end of March, construction would stop in our factories", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car makers have raised concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said they will close their Mini plant in Sweden for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what the car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars that are built on order.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be problems at the border, problems which the industry says would lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its factory in Derby, the company said, so the construction would have to be halted.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU had been carefully drawn up to avoid those border checks.
We need an agreement, we want to get the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity", he told Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery chains that have been very successful.
Toyota could not say how long production would last, but in the long term, it warned that additional costs would affect the ability of factories to compete and would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union coordinator at the factory, said his members were increasingly worried: "From my experience once these jobs are gone they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with deputy national security adviser Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the battle for the top Brett Kavanaugh nomination continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss a national security deputy, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been the talk of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the president using the 25th parallel.
Rosenstein called the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, because he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing a full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: 'There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that it will be postponed for another week because of all the other things going on at the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to give the latest information to the press.
Some reporters would question that claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace explained why.
Sanders said that dislike for the overcrowded television newscasters was the reason for the lack of briefing, though he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are overcrowded".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, adding without citing any evidence: "We have looked at those numbers".
Sanders said that the briefing would continue, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the USA, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks.
Trump is often asked questions as he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting presidents.
Individual conferences between the press are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, making an appearance at times both cheery and odd in front of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU staff in Scottish NHS over Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation for the country and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in the devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been intensifying preparations for the possibility of a no-deal situation.
I know that this time has been very unstable for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and it is our very great wish that you remain here.
Christie Abercrombie had emergency surgery after being injured in a head injury
Tennessee State linebacker Christion Abercrombie has had emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury as the team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Rees told reporters that the injury was sustained before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and some sort of jump there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel supplied oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and pulling him back for further assessment.
An officer from the Tennessee Valley told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just come from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the nature of the injury or how bad the injury was yet and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before being forced to leave the game, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to provide aid to the homeless under new Tory schemes.
This proposal will neutralise the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be given to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to Â£120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that overseas buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to provide aid for the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those who earn large salaries.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies not paying UK tax, and the extra money will boost the Government's intention to tackle people sleeping rough.
The additional surcharge to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let homes, can be as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects this proposal to raise up to Â£120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of all new properties in London are bought by residents from outside the UK, and this is raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - especially in the capital - have become areas of disadvantage because so many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to stop buying affordable homes to repair Britain's housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn has announced a sweeping series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to the displacement of people from their 'high-rise' homes.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year, I said I would give up my job as prime minister to restore the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our deficient housing market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that non-UK individuals, as well as companies based abroad, should be able to buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is far from within reach, and the shame of sleeping out on the street remains all too real.
Jack Ross: My ambition is to eventually rule Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to manage the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Albanian is looking to the challenge of reviving the North-West club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points clear at the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were relegated back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B and that's it", Ross told Sportsound, a BBC Scotland programme.
As a child, I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden with my father, and something has always held me back.
That opportunity will only come to me if I am successful in running a club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, who was also a former manager of Sunderland.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of taking such strong names at such a big club, and he has turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My goal at the moment will be to see if I can lead this club back to the Premier League".
The structure and facilities of the club make it a member of the Premier League without question, he said.
It will not be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful if we couldn't get the club back there.
It is only three years since Ross began his managerial career, having spent time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to lift them from relegation to the third tier, and converted St Mirren from relegation to the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever was during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a historical point", he said, recalling taking the plunge in Alloa.
I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds weird because I was right, I made a reasonable living off of it, and I made a career out of it.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through that in terms of stress and pressure of work but the control feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager and now that I have achieved that, I feel more content with my life than ever.

The perfect time for a bench is 5.30 on a Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot summer weather has boosted hard-to-reach British restaurant incomes, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bar and restaurant groups saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but a 4.8 per cent decline in restaurant house earnings, according to figures.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA who compiled the figures said: "As the hot weather has continued, and England has stayed at the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern is quite similar to June and July, where pubs saw an increase of 2.8 per cent, but restaurants have suffered more than ever.
After the 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Bars and pubs that sold drinks performed best, seeing more gains than restaurants saw losses.
Restaurants that focus on selling food also suffered due to the sun, though not as much as people who run restaurants.
It seems that going out for a drink was just what people wanted to do.
Across the bars and pubs that were regulated, there was an increase of 6.6 per cent in beverage sales for the month, while there was a decrease of three per cent in food.
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analyst firm RSM said: "These results show a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain major factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8% year-on-year decline is sure to be distressing as well as a continuing cost burden.
The long summer could not have come at a worse time for people running restaurants focused on selling food, and the more moderate August weather will probably provide some much-needed respite.
In July, there was a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in bars and restaurants, including newly opened ones, reflecting the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK restaurant and catering sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 action groups.
One in five children have social media accounts hidden from their parents.
One in five children - as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents or teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has heightened concerns that sexual content is being posted
Twenty of the hundred students said they had a special account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts - which refers to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty of the hundred pupils said they had a suitable account to show to parents, while they also had some private ones.
One mother came across her 13-year-old daughter's hiding place and saw a teenager encouraging others to rape me.
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Conference (HMC), found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers cannot find".
Doyle will be the first athlete to be elected to the Scottish Athletics Hall of Fame.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Athletics Scotland as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from the wide range of experience she has at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the UK and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes would greatly benefit from having her on board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am keen to be a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute and help to lead sport in Scotland.'
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of his four other Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular panellist on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a bout of transient ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "Back today I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would get better or how much better I would get.
It's been a bit of a struggle but I'm completely recovered, I've learned how to walk again and today I'm doing some exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!
There is a variety of opinions online about pump advertising almost comparing moms to cows
A variety of online opinions are generated by an advertising company that almost equates mothers who feed with cows being slaughtered.
To mark the launch of what is being called the world's first wearable semi-disto pump, the tech goods company Elvie has released a cellware ad in the form of a moving video to show the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cowhide, to a drac containing words such as: "I'm lifting myself up, but you don't see the walls" and "I'm afraid you didn't notice, these are not doors, but hearts".
The man in the street said to him, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding a baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding a baby".
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been a burning topic online.
With 77,000 people viewing the video and hundreds of comments, it has received mixed reaction from viewers, with some saying it does not portray the sex industry's Holocaust seriously.
It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them within days of giving birth", one wrote.
Elvie's pump almost fits the inside of a nursing bra and out of sight (Elvie/Mam)
Another said: 'It's understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump almost to mothers who are having their babies?
And another said, "A wise man is one who does not understand the world to come".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admits that she sees the song as an over-the-top phenomenon.
This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I had still been feeding from the breast.
Pumping made me feel just like a chicken.
The ad was a bit dirty but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product", wrote one
Another said: "This is a fun-filled campaign aimed at pumped-up mothers (often in the workplace or toilets) and feeling like a cow".
The advertising industry is not praised or criticized.
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they have been dancing with the pimples hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump their breasts feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits inside a nursing cabinet.This gives women the freedom to move, to hold their baby, and even go outside while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a major launch and a pre-release.
By illustrating the similarity between breast milk and cow milk, we wanted to highlight the challenges of pumping milk, showing the incredible freedom that comes from pumping milk in a new and relevant way.
This is not the first time Elvie's bomb has made the front page.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to Camp on the Texas Coast
The number of unaccompanied children being held has increased sharply, although the number of children crossing the border each month has remained unchanged, in part because the restrictions and strict policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been immigrants themselves without the right to be in the country, and they have been concerned about risking their right to stay in the country by going ahead to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adults in the home would have to give fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had tried to smuggle unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are sponsors or members of a sponsored household are living in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals,' said Mr Albence.
To process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the norm, according to asylum workers.
Many of them will appear via video-conference call, rather than in person, to plead cases for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be sent out of the country without pay.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in detention the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent behaviour or to an attempt to escape.
Advocates say such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering can be ignored, because of its size.
It was added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many are fighting against.
Syria is telling occupied tribes from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Welcoming the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its seventh year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, were fighting terrorism, and would be dealt with appropriately.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem called for the war on terror to be nearly halted in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy war until we have cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and any illegal overseas presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers to patrol the war-ravaged country.
In discussing refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed Western countries for unreasonable fears encouraging refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process of their return", he said.
They have turned a purely humanitarian issue into a political one.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a major Syrian offensive against the province, which is home to three million people, by Russian-backed forces.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had time limits and expressed the hope that military action targeting jihadists would include fighters from the Nusra Front who are linked to Al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee comprising members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work would review existing articles of the constitution, and warned against interfering.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Granted, Mr. Trump could be reelected in 2020 unless, as many liberals are sure to hope, impeachment and scandal soon bring his presidency to an end.
And that would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At this time, there are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a story that attracts people because we don't understand it", said Neal Baer, the co-host of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack to destroy the capital.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the midst of chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the ability to bring immigrant families back together, and the state of the world's economy at large.
Only the most privileged viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes further than being an informed citizen when you realize that you're on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of the words "heavy background" as he leaks information for his book "Fear, the $15,000-worth of Paul Manafort's skin cancer" (read with too much pride, according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's gruesome descriptions of, in, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I personally will never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you with something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's characters being circulated daily in the streets (N.F.L. fight, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to fail one chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
She couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then for a while and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,' Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth is they were right.

Money from outside flows into the midterm election races in the House
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is receiving a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that means two delegates are in the race for the same seat.
The newly redrawn Pittsburgh metropolitan area favours Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is roughly overlapped by the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old division was unconstitutionally unfair in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has been a campaign finance battle between the finance branches of the major parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a highly publicized contest in March in a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
Republicans had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits say the Democrats are ahead.
U.D. is concerned about punishing El Salvador for giving support to China, then withdrawing
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much unfavorable reaction from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017.
State Department officials decided to recall heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent "decisions to refuse to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from America in 2017, which included drug control, economic and development assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high rate of unemployment and homicides.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials interrupted a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, and thus put an end to any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence had been tapped to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting.
And the three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard news or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to give details of the debate described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to talk about the internal talks on the condition that they remain anonymous.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next big event could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility of Mr. Trump obstructing justice, where there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also reportedly discusses in his report whether the Mr. Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability to that body, and he is preparing to face voters once again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in a long and late battle.
There is a lot of uncertainty about that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
There are choices that need to be made by each of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of the effort.
In 1938 German officials were ready to stage a coup d'Ã©tat against Hitler, but the West resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We were defeated, and we lost the chance to avoid the years of total war.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the unpredictable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing many of these turning points now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's running Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper reported last year, that he had secretly suggested recording a lecture and speculated that he was unsuitable for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times report is incorrect.
How will we respond if the FBI's newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is neither full nor fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and testimony of an unreliable witness?
In particular, will we vote in the midterm elections of a party of Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to test those, it will be very difficult for democracy.
But I think we'll never fail, because of the lessons I learned in Marrakesh.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table that showed the swastika.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers was a forward before playing against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians, following the draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, means they are in a good position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A back injury meant Graham Dorrans was unable to play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something and we came away with a point.
We may have been beaten in the end but, on the whole, a fair game was more than likely.
They probably were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As for Thursday night, there is another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game but with the crowd supporting us I am sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
It was definitely a challenging year, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made at the club itself, but it feels good in the place now.
The car is good and the boys are enjoying a terrific time; the practice is good.
Hopefully we can hold on now, forgetting about the last season and succeed.
Women are losing sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they would talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business for Nationwide.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your spouse or children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
Your financial adviser should be involved: your financial adviser can help you to think about how to pay for these costs too.
Your options for long-term care financing can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-added life insurance policy to cover those costs or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Make sure you have a healthcare brochure so that you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical care to make sure professionals are complying with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider a backup for your financial affairs.
You would choose someone you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you can do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It is more than financial matters, who are the doctors? asked Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Complete that plan.
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walks home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Dublin, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred at about 2.30pm BST, as a random act.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
With communications cut off, rescue officials have been unable to get any information from Donggala Prefecture, an area in northern Palau that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been displaced after an earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a headland stretching for more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The prefecture, an administrative area under the province, had a population target of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main contributors to the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the country, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the coast on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck off the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December causing a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that lashed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres (33 ft) that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake rocked the Pidie Jaya province of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it was not caused by a tsunami, but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: A major earthquake hits Lombok, a seaside island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman confessed to him trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Correctional Facility and is being held on a $500 bond without security, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was Jewish, specifically when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and possession of a firearm in connection with the incident.
Her lover claimed that he had given her a point in his countenance.
Sarah Pilan was criticized by ex-servicemen groups in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behavior to PTSD stemming from her time serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being shared on social media showing the scene of the incident.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the maximum penalty for the man suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the ultimate punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the horrific New York City attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to attack a bike path along the Western Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bicyclists in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight individuals and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the warning of intent to seek death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both courts are capable of imposing a fair punishment, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of robbery for fraud, charges typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required significant planning and planning, describing Saipov's attack as a vicious, cruel and corrupt one.
"The Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, Alejandro and Damian Pagnucco", the warning said, adding that the attack was deliberate.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York introduced the ultimate penalty.
The perpetrator, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal case was tried in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked for an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said they were disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the ultimate punishment rather than accept a life sentence in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the trauma of these events for everyone involved", said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to seek the maximum penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to act on the voice of the people today during a protest at the Doria conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the pressure from European MEPs - as one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested he should be in charge of EU talks.
At the rally in Birmingham, Peter Bone, a Conservative backbencher, said the UK would be leaving by now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in re-engaging her deeply divided ranks is based on pro-Russian Dorians joining another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep order on his Chequers project amid attacks by pro-Brexit, pro-Remain and pro-European Union people.
Allies have demanded that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels in the event of a breakdown - forcing Euro-stabilists and Labour members to choose between her and Merkel's package.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "fight the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a gentleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
AS Wellingborough added: I will stand for Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be equal.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong".
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexit member, was also in the march and told reporters: "I'm saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are not popular with the public, the Conservatives are not going to vote for the plan, they are unpopular with our party and active members who are marching in the streets to elect us in the first place.
Don't get ahead of the Chequers and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, he added: 'Chief ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do that.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, she added: 'I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who won our Brexit victory and we will continue to do so until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-Aros protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory banners in the face of Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
One of the Labour lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with the party's app when opening the conference.
"We are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for hard borderless borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he said.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren seriously about running for president
Elizabeth Warren, a US Senator, says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
There has been much speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
At the Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon, she met with constituents for the 36th time using a town hall format since Trump took office.
Someone in the audience asked if she intended to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a girl on the top.
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in an ET news conference at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died instantly as a result", Murphy J. Paul, a senior police officer, told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde entered to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was placed in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team order helps him win ahead of Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's setup would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and nearly left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack a teammate.
Vettel went for the first hole, leaving Hamilton to reach the end of the pack, something that should have been the intention.
The Mercedes went into a lap hole later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, reluctantly, leaving the inside free in danger of a catch to go after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he continued his diars to try to finish fast and pass Kimi Raikkonen to secure fourth place.
He finally got the ball on lap 44 but was unable to pick up speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came in fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a good man to let me pass.
"The team has done a great job to get one or two", said Hamilton.
This is the Fine Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday for refusing to share a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed people to be hateful and evil and lying.
The same thing could happen and the blessed thing has been going on in the last few days in the Senedd, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and mean and liars", he said.
When you look at the statements and the documents that are being shared and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you distribute the letter?
Remember his answer... you shared the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, that's not it.
I did not share the document.
Well, wait a minute.
We shared the document...I swear, we did nothing, he added, ignoring the senator.
Feinstein obtained the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and it was shared in early September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep a letter secret and I did as she asked.
But the president didn't seem to believe it, and he made a comment during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you something, his body language was very bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the senator suggested that Democrats use the allegations against their own constituents.
They are determined to take power back by any means necessary.
You see the hatred, the hate, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control", said the President according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for a defeat in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard opened the scoring for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Wednesday night.
This was the fourth time the teams had met this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide a goal to equalize Cownie's time of 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first period as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team came back and, once again, Bouchard equalised with a powerful goal of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal midway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure that Hundreds of Airmen Can Escape an Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people lifted off the ground safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Heavy rainfall continues to hit the area and many are stuck in rubble in the town of Palu.
But while his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the highly fortified control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He stayed there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could lift off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan for transport to a smaller hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's a terrible news", he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the disaster relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is likely that the numbers will continue to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and many bodies we have not yet reached", said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters have washed away Palu, which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing a body here every minute.
Fresh water is scarce.
People steal from small supermarkets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already dire, but it could get much worse.
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to movement and transportation".
Are you ready?" he asked CNN.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
Plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes into a lagoon
The airline that was flying a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia is now saying that one man is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew managed to leave the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a single person on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six people were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had gone over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American traveler, said that the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to walk through water to their midst to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the flight crew were shouting and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said sailors working to recover nearby had helped rescue people by using a wind boat to carry people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades but none of these involve Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night his wife was burned alive
The prosecution presented its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An Analyst from the United States Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the movements of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she had obtained location data from many cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that her cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone during the time she had said she was with her friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday saying he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was Sanford's uncle that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my uncle was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
He took it away from his life, said Hale.
The defender will begin his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio is about challenging the negative image of the genre by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which are political messages and tackling social issues.
They're eager to get back to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new ton of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York's Nani sues couple for dismissing her following a text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discrimination against her and has dismissed her after she received a text message from her mother complaining that she was a different person.
The couple denied being racial, saying the situation was as if someone was trying to gain an advantage.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to see that the childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"I am a person of the people", wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, rather than send the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt disappointed, fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their old grandmother, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was rather expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation because she was fired, and she is trying to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation that she was initially hired to do, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is a cause for division".
The couple have criticised the allegations of racism, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the sensible thing to do, as they feared they could not trust him after his injury.
My wife sent me something she didn't think I should say.
She is not a racist.
We are not a racial people", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children with someone you were involved with, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so.
Comparing a legal case to the situation of someone trying to benefit him, Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two weeks and that she was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do", said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, it was a long time before the court of public opinion condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and their reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not unite with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very interesting to know what we know about the Paddington's unfortunate success.
He said his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a young boy, would have accepted if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the books were published felt very sad after his death last year.
He said his father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success in the minor leagues, describing him as a very important member of the family.
He was a quiet man, and he was not a boastful man, he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he regards Paddington's success in that way.
Although his creativity and imagination were the work, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say that things were very bad, and she did not expect her to come through, said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beating began to come to an end and leave her system.
She had died shortly before and now everything was shutting down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't hope or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave.
It was too late for Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, to get on the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her fate.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down, and tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Girls in mourning post cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two girls who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Ms Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and had a smelly smile.
He was remembered for his smile.
They always said that her smile lights up any room.
However, he gave up his work before he died because it was a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was found dead after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: 'I always worry that it will have an impact later.'
Ms Davis designed the cards to let people know that there are people they can go to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't sit in silence - you must speak.
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after he lost his mother.
He didn't say he was feeling sad or low or anything like that, he said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't make any eye contact with them or anything.
He said that his death had been a huge shock to them, but that they had to come through: It's tearing a hole through my house.
It's cutting us to pieces.
But we all have to carry on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in the spotlight as the FBI began investigating
I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited in time, limited in scope investigation - maybe we could secure some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was collapsing amid an unexpected partisan legislative storm.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh tell his Republican supporters about the FBI investigation?
Their timeliness is related to timing.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will have significantly weakened their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been raising the phone to call Senators, urging them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can secure at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision on whether to confirm the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee problems under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has decreased since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean law.
Park Byeong-seok, citing data from the South's unification administration, said there were 1,127 cases of forced flight last year - down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the tighter border control processes between North Korea and China and the higher rates at which people smugglers cross, were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most people who flee the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who flee as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their own country.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a rough go at working towards denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves in the first place", Mr Ri said in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh unreliable, saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "unreasonable" saying that he was unfit, due to the nature of his character, to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribeca Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her unreasonable", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in his denial of allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both in their teens.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, almost screaming and bursting into tears at times while discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that the allegations against him consistently and unambiguously tarnish his good name and that they have been planted by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because his testimony showed he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he's showing that he's inconsistent with those statements and the way he covered up Clinton supporters and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi petitioned when asked if she would seek confirmation, and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court or be on the court that he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that she as a Democrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible charges against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn specific Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time to have an unfair and unjust judge in court waiting for us to say, 'Is that great?'", Pelosi said.
Women should not be silent about evil.
A just sentence, months and years of good fortune accumulate, and cannot be removed without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who said that she cries when she's sad, but that she's developed a technique and so, when she gets mad and starts crying, she'll say to the person who's talking to her, 'You think I'm sorry that I'm crying?'
I'm the boss.
And then I'll carry on.
And I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed to give expression to anger in part because they are, in principle, misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were the most important, and I cried with a rage beyond words, is an older woman grabbing me by the back of my neck -- a cold-blooded manager who always scared me -- and she threw me down a flight of stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're a witch.
They think you're sad and they'll be proud that you've been hurt.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an out-of-court marriage on a horse called Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Ms Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realised that there was no reason why she should not think about running for president herself.
"I hadn't thought about the decision properly", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing he needed was another.
He called us the sheep of the flock, and the seven lions.
Because she was late to the campaign, she was behind him in raising money, so she promised she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a futile battle.
She noticed that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to men gave only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm going to get a reduction?" he asked.
When her letter announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, her emotions got the better of her - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and trade voters rather than representatives, and anger at the discrimination based on sex - and she began to cry.
"You'd think my nerves would have gone", Ms Schroeder said of the way the press reacted to her.
You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
How can a US-China trade war be in Beijing's favor
The first waves of the US-China trade war were enough to scare anyone, and while the fighting is not over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump first issued a warning this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (Â£150 billion) worth of items, taxing, for all intents and purposes, half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly paid back the debt and, most recently, has imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match the efforts of the US and is not the world's only largest economy likely to give up soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving up on the demands, but publicly criticizing the U.S. would raise far too much embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say if Beijing can get its act together very quickly, the US trade war pressure could support China in a positive way in the longer term by making the two economies less dependent on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic collapse in either country is, in fact, much more dangerous than observers have previously recognized", said Abigail Grace, a Middle East researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, who is a debate panelist.
Syria 'ready' to welcome asylum seekers back, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept asylum seekers back voluntarily and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been torn apart by seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure, thanks to the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is working hard to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Conditions are now right for the reception of asylum seekers back in the country after having to flee from terrorism and damaging economic measures that threatened their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The UDA have lost six consecutive times on European soil, and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as the team of Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Denmark, reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a tough tournament, but when the star of the USA ice hockey hit the ball in the water on the par-3 16th hole he had to abandon the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian golfer, dominated in all rounds, becoming the first of four players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the best player on paper in Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World top scorer Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who was playing more than likely in his final Ryder Cup.
Playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players in the tournament's history with a career average of 25.5 points.
"I'm not one to believe usually, but I can't help that today.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for my choice and for putting his trust in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm glad I was able to help", said Garcia through his tears after Europe's win.
He passed the bat to fellow countryman John Ram who beat USA golf champion Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, meaning his Ryder Cup record is now 13-21-3.
And that's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, as he's won 14 championships in his career, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had struggled all weekend to find the clear way.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "We're proud of our boys, they fought hard.
We had put pressure on Europe in the morning.
We fought.
You have to give credit to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
Each of the 12 players played very well.
We're gonna fight back. I want to work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee. We have to move forward.
I love having 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
You must raise a hat to them.
They played better than us".
The latest news on the Red Sea: Populations have decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in the Red River basin for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, areas of mudflats are appearing in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting that concentrations are declining.
The Red Lake Plain extends for about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee positions.
There are pockets of it about 10 miles offshore from Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
The Red Stag was also seen in Pasco County.
Moderate land and sea concentrations in Pinellas County have appeared in the past week, low to high land and sea concentrations from Hillsborough County, unconscious to high land and sea concentrations from Manatee County, unconscious to high land and sea concentrations from Sarasota County, unconscious to mediocre land and sea concentrations from Charlotte County, unconscious to high land and sea concentrations from Lee County, and low concentrations from Collier County.
Reports of residual pain continue to appear at Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier positions.
There has been no reported cases of respiratory illness in Northwest Florida over the past week.
