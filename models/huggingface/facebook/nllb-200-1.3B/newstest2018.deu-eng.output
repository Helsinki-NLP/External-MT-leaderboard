Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mental institution where young people meet today.
A tomb chapel where the subway tunnel is being dug.
Small-scale farmers are farming the land that used to be farmers' land.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who's ever had to get upset because the car navigator showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road knows that.
The historical maps of the Bavarian Digital Atlas, a service of the Bavarian State Government's geoportal, are far from up-to-date - but precisely for this reason they are very informative.
Especially when you compare them to current online maps.
This will show how cities and communities in the Munich Mercury area have changed since the 19th century.
The Bavarian digital atlas is a patchwork of paper that is not immediately recognizable as such.
The large overview map has been supplemented by more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, called "Urposition Sheets".
These were created between 1810 and 1864 according to the information provided by the Bavarian Survey Office and are the result of the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client is Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second War of Coalition with Austria.
Napoleon wanted to get an overview of the occupied territory and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a land-wide Bavarian map.
The project was continued by the Elector Max IV Joseph, who established the Topographical Bureau - the Bavarian Survey Office.
The original sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library, as can all other copies.
The comparison between then and now is most striking in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and grown together.
An example is the Underdog, which appears relatively isolated on the 1856 map.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, in 1877.
Today, Underdog is in the middle of the city.
The houses of the Undendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance, when you zoom in, you see a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered floor pieces from the so-called "original record", from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - they are occupied by small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area is visible north of Unterendling.
The Theresienwiese, which has been the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the first page of the paper, you can read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858/59 the Munich circle of madness "On the Heavens" was founded there.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time, ending, for example, the chain of so-called lunatics.
He also forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates", says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved in an exhibition at the institution.
The hospital had initially accommodated 280 patients, but was later expanded to 500 seats.
At a certain point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district hospital in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
The former Auer Institute is now the meeting place of the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the football field of TSV Munich East, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's home "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural imitation of the original building of the madhouse, which was destroyed during bombing during World War II.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, Allied bombs tore many holes in the city center.
A large one remains today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at Marienhof, where the preliminary work is being done and on 5 April 2017 the spanning of the second S-Bahn main line.
The slider allows comparison of the old Munich map with the air view of today - and fills the hole at Marienhof.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, scheduled to take effect on August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling through the state, due to a series of questionable racially-based incidents that have occurred throughout the state recently and are noted here", the group's statement said.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have civil rights violations that people are going through.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed", said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, to the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at a frequency we have never heard before".
It's the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and being taken into custody by Missouri State Police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which shows that black motorists are stopped 75 percent more often in the state than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared to bring bail or let relatives know they're traveling across the state".
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, which ranks the state 16th in the nation in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
The grazing fence project is a basic
The Fischerbach Weidefensternung project is a successful project and will be continued next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture of themselves on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holidaymakers in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the only alternative for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
The holiday guests are served with only regional food.
As he is also chairman of Fischerbach's BLHV, he described the grazing fence project as "elementary important".
I can't make a profit on such steep terrain.
The green area provides a lot of work, much has to be worked with the motor sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and the topography", Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and ran it without chemical plant protection products and fertilisers, even though he did not run an organic farm.
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the grazing fence project and is pleased with Leader support".
At a cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the afforestation of the land to be delayed for some time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their farming", the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for their support
The grassland fencing scheme was used to fence 25 plots in 2013 by 11 participants.
The area of the reserve is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half was financed by Leader and a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
The farmers thus had 12 610 euros left over, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: 'You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers we cannot do it'.
Peter Weiß was also certain: "Here the best food is produced".
The Landscape Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows for the state to support grazing fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The condition is the existence of a supporting background as defined by the LPR.
The area to be fenced must not be suitable for shrimp farming (inclination above 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The Fischerbach Weidefensternetz 2018 project is currently being implemented by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build a nearly 16-kilometre fence.
The area of the site is 35 hectares and the estimated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans value it as much as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked its significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts".
There's never been a better time to see the "miserable waste" on our screens.
Miller didn't engage in literary criticism -- he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who were working to get her words out to the base after she died, knew full well that they were doing something highly political.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exile.
The poem's association with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people on the right wing have long wanted to change that back.
The great scribe Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame to the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She's supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States".
Quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see him as he was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were on the Great Britain team
UK athletics director Neil Black says that the 16-man Scottish World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that UK athletics needs to learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to keep doing it until we find out", Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And the guy on the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant".
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
"Your captain's speech was incredible", says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, came out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championships to date was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will compete in the 1,500- and 5,000-meter races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victories at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first World Cups when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "tremendously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases also participate in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special to me", she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are on the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on the podium.
As far as my captain's speech is concerned?
Yeah, I think she did fine.
I was just pointing out that we're very happy in this situation, because we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put that home support on and take advantage of being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the heat of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers beat him up for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He was a bit of a scolding man, I'm sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland, where Governor Larry Hogan has to work on becoming more like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "So what?"
"It's just Facebook", many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a vastly democratic state who is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval rating of the 50 governors in the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and a strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless post-chemotherapy head on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and is staffed by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who are whipping people online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his mail and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news", she wrote in the comment section of The Post.
"I also don't appreciate this idea, when a number of people take a stand on the same issue, they are dismissed by some as a so-called collective effort rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "advocacy" by others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a story by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the past, if you'd done the same thing, that you sent employees to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter occurred last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers followed his lead.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't shut her up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership is about accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club .
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be looking forward to the comforts of home over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led the Archerfield Links to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and we see it reaching its glory with this event", Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's a passionate supporter of this game and proud of his accomplishments here.
This is a great showcase for this course".
Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special", said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
Memories of last year are coming back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a truly special time and one that we will always cherish".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, is returning to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it right, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid round of golf.
I'm glad it went this far".
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less deaths from lung cancer from secondhand smoke
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of secondhand smoke.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"We estimate that 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to secondhand smoke", said study leader Heiko Becher.
He used his own 1994 study on the subject as a comparison.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to secondhand smoke.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections are proving to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Strasse is in full swing and "is somewhat on time", says Fred Heinze, the head of the construction site.
The situation in the field of housing connections is more complicated than expected, as much is hidden underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly impedes the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of motorists about red lights and traffic jams is already enormous", reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only regular buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cold mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt", relates Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tubers are removed and eaten with diligent, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with muddy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m"., she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by publicly raising their hands before the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence, which had revolted against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is boring, and the journey involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a five-hour drive by car every morning.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs that have been turned into various shades of yellow-brown by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and light skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 percent of the population living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
But this wealth is a source of misery for the Papuans, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden geese and are being treated with ruthlessness.
Activists say more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal lands in the 1970s were classified as genocide by the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything", says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic trends are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gadō gadō, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the traditional market at a lower price than the local Papuans", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, to work.
"It has cost the indigenous people of Papua - the Mama-Mama [women] of Papua - their market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequality and legal violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting him to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored", You says.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols at a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was offended by their sound and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, an internal radio message was sent to the soldiers: "If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them to death", according to an official TIME document, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist", he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, lots of shots were fired", he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only has one name, told TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him".
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only trying to "secure" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta 'filtered' until the following day.
For three weeks Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic wrongs in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to tackling these violations, but there are processes that have to go through", he said.
Wiranto then backed off when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything will be regulated by law", he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with bitter disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress", says Yohanes.
"I'm tired. "
He says that years later, he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me", he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid there would be revenge", says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days".
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is adding to the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the lush highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (FPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuan people by inciting sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty is the strength of discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat, especially nutmeg and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten notes were only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between the native Papuans and the new migrants have grown, with more arriving since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region tend to go to the more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for failing to coordinate with related institutions, despite being given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to cover Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist", he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is a free media, so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights cases".
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him to "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning person, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings", says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from being under constant threat from a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai victims performed one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried in a plot directly opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed", Yacobus says, his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire broke out Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building, which is casually called the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we woke up to the fire alarm and the screams of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at around 0400 hours local time.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The incident may reignite questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Best of five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed at the general assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, the proposal, revolutionary for the sport, to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets, was hardly supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-movement classics, which are often very long but therefore highly regarded, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, thus narrowly missing the goal set by ITF President David Haggerty.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historic competition", said Haggerty.
We will continue to work on improving the application.
The proposal to hold the final in a neutral venue had already been put to the vote, after many objections.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: So the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will in the future in the following year in the first round have the right to host.
In order to reduce costs for the organisers, the requirements regarding training places etc. will be eased and players will have to attend fewer official media meetings before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring illegal items on board, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered late that they had accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those who admitted knowingly trying to fly something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security, while 2.2 percent of female and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illicit drugs on the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally smuggled contraband through airport security and how many had done so intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband through security, whether they know it or not, were the ones most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books to be contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their orders
Elon Musk, the electric billionaire, is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
The Commission has thus far failed to state that some customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time, when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet, another, less glamorous figure: that of the cancellations of the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk has often advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just beginning to be delivered.
Now Musk admits that of the 518,000 preorders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment".
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
The Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders so far could be a problem.
His argument: the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not on the demand side, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla shipped 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models combined, it's expected to be 500,000, and in 2020, a million.
The demand for it is obvious.
Musk says there are currently 1,800 reservations added per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to run its brand new production lines, never tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are any major delays, the unbinding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot stop dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns over delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental laws.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to great lengths to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries are opposed to.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback to Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround on ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet implementation deadlines and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others and to agree on a deadline for implementation", said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulating by judicial procedures and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt would at some point use its "power of delay and any other powers available by law" to ensure that the regulations were "based on sound policy and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive overhaul of the ozone laws.
A draft law approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities", Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in this case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The smog that results can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step forward from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to appeal to polluters and their special interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the church, a serene ceremony will be held on the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4:30 p.m.
With its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has become the concern of the friends and supporters of Tumlingen.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village meadow".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first documented in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen together with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a lordly court on the Tumlinger mountain, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people living there, too.
As the description of the Freudenstadt High Office of 1858 shows, besides the sub- and upper villages, which can still be seen in the town of Tumlingen today, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Ancient maps from the 1600's support these historical facts.
The paternity law arose from the early medieval ecclesiastical law.
A man who built, furnished and appointed a minister could continue to own the church and could also inherit the church.
This included the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke apart on Christmas Day 1673.
The newly purchased bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be surrendered later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell-soles stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796 French troops camped near the church.
They tore out the pulpit and chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower-dwarf, which still exists today, has survived as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensioners" are the successors to Dieter Dockhorn in the care of the Hilarius plant.
As the organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16th at the old cemetery at St. Hilarius Chapel.
The composition is by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann will speak the final word.
The program starts at 4:30.
Admission is at 3:30.
To end the serenade, a drink will be served at the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers point out the fantastic view.
The serenade is only held in dry weather.
The organizers hope to gather many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius site, which is of importance to the Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel a special commitment to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have wind turbine permits checked
The Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his authorization for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone in Viersen on the city boundary with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants is in principle possible, but the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
The aim of the zones is to prevent the landscape from being "sparked".
The city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier, by amending the land use plan, to build a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a design error.
"Because of the lack of planning requirements, the permit issued is still illegal and therefore also withdrawable", said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wears off".
Current situation: The city council has decided again on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This prevents planning permission for the construction of wind turbines at this point".
The circle confirms receipt of the summons.
"The correspondence has been received by the Viersen district since last week", a spokesman explained.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to reexamine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to a halt in the proceedings.
In view of the proceedings before the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the arguments of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four windmills each 200 metres high on a site on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen has an indirect interest, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of some 11 400 households - about one fifth of all four households.
NEW Re is planning to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine at Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: woman killed in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district).
A woman was fatally wounded.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The country road was blocked for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich was driving her car in the direction of Bogel, with her 53-year-old mother as a passenger.
City and retailers plan 'home shopping' weekends
The city of Langensalza and people from the region are to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade union and the city administration want to use the weekend of September 8 and 9 to lure residents into the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekend is intended to make customers aware of what offers their city has to offer outside the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce local companies with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the city centre should invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is not limited to residents of the city and the surrounding region.
The campaign is being prepared by radio commercials, an Internet video and printed bags, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The association and the city are now entering a new phase of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
This includes new activities such as the first "Active Day" at the Fountain Festival, including a Sunday open to the public, and discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to take an active part.
The concept also includes attractive Saturday offers and the waiver of parking fees on that day.
The aim is to develop new or renewed customer potential.
This includes holidaymakers and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to the revitalization of the city centre - from landlords, to the businesses of the whole city and to associations.
The network is needed to overcome the lethargy that has partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that for the first time five Thuringian cities will participate in the third "Home Shopping Day" nationwide.
Besides the town of Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The aim of the day is to "promote the value of local commerce and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action, led by the IHK and with many partners, also shows that each citizen can influence his or her immediate environment through his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
Nine more people were injured.
A gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine others, some seriously.
According to the fire department, one injured person was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing person was later recovered dead.
The dead were school employees.
The authorities suspected that the cause of the accident was work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payments after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the United States scolded him for denouncing the wall publicly, and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press".
Trump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and he vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a deal for the United States to accept refugees who migrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "fucking" and "stupid", and that insisting on the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "deep-ass" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call of the day".
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynchings as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the Ford Bridge at Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles came out to block its way.
The mob leader - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long pull at his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n---- r Roger!" shouted the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22 is only a reenactment.
But then when a noose is thrown around "Roger"'s neck, almost everyone in the audience gives out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to replicate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the retrospective.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice", he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we have justice".
A coroner lays a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the lynchings has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black rancher Roger Malcom stabbed a white landlord, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said there was a rumor going around town that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then as they were walking away from the prison and approaching Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison was the one who prepared and ordered the murders", concludes an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, "which not only participated in the murders, "but also destroyed evidence and covered up the identities of witnesses".
Brooks is even more concise.
"It was a suffrage massacre", he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this community, "If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you".
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been running the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their presentation is vivid, poignant, and is grounded in a kind of deep-seated racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we're going to be confronted with the ugliness of it in all of us", she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or hear what I've been through".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene began a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Green's co-director here.
He's been playing the role of clan chief for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that", Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive, because we don't want to go back to those times".
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm screaming at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona is returning fire.
There's a break.
And then everybody (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene is the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No", said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said a--he".
"Yeah", one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard R".
And that's where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone's busy getting this right, not just for the game, but for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
No one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming, there's gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and delivers Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every word.
About a hundred yards away, a group of about four dozen spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple has come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They've all experienced Georgia's crushing humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcomes and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
As the last notes of the song are played, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body.
Children squat on their heads, registering the fake blood and the silent bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead", murmurs a little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the Clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through for him.
"It's okay", whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are having an uproar about the re-enactment with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find the words to describe the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you", she said.
"What this really does to me is make me believe that the lynching is still going on", she added, "and today it's just called police shooting".
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks is holding his table, eating and reminding people about civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning the show for next year.
"Re-enactment is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning", he said.
"The thing is, if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
"Whoever does not study his own history, whoever does not know his own history, is doomed to repeat it".
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets out to stage a colourful, frivolous production set against a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The set (designed by Aleksandar Denic) features a shabby street corner with walls and a Dönerbude in Berlin, a "plastic and elastic" logo from the GDR or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes-Vintage, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockers, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked barrels of oil remind us of Castorf's main motive - money, power and greed - that is reflected in his "Ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as they did in "Rheingold".
They seduce Siegfried, drag a dead body into the trunk in Hollywood style, and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gorgeously ugly Hagen, surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther will have to believe it too.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a rousing applause.
The celebrations are stormy, with Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
The festival orchestra is being applauded for its first appearance on stage - in light leisure clothing in the face of the heat.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
If he had to have a flute concert in 2013, there was a great jubilation five years later, in which the isolated "Buh" cries were submerged.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been happy about that.
"You can see that the audience has grown in some way with the 'Ring,'" she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made some kind of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his view.
I'll take a positive note.
Max amount works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their year of volunteering.
Where?
I usually work in the furniture department in Steinfurt, but once a week I help out here in Greven at the furniture department.
And I've worked at the school all day.
What's your experience with that?
It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with teenagers, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 now, so you're a late-term volunteer.
How's that?
I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, dropped out.
I realized that it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
I think that the Commission should be able to give a clearer picture of the situation in the Community.
And did you?
I've had some great impressions.
I'm starting my social studies in the winter semester.
I'm going to double-major, probably get a social worker's training at the youth office in Herne and study at the technical university in Hamm.
Is it not unusual to have several different assignments during the volunteer service?
Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your F.S.J.
You can do it from nursing home to youth work -- all sorts of social work.
I had a lot of variety.
I was also part-time in OGS, which is afternoon care.
I thought that was the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different than in civil engineering?
Crowd: Well, of course, this isn't about calculating statistics.
You keep seeing other people, each with a different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken away from his family, you must always deal with it individually.
That's very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touch?
I'm not the type.
It's a field that gives you a lot.
Much love, much kindness.
There are times when it's bad, but that's life.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to revive the business.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent as it embarks on another restructuring program to overcome the pressures the company is facing.
The job cuts announced by CEO John Fallon, mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which had already led to the loss of 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after rising 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports also claim that three civilians were killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence that Afghanistan has seen this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-borne improvised explosive device".
The statement said that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision on delaying smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation that obligates states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday its decision to push forward the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our government partners", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone regulations - which are intended to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is designed to boost economic growth.
However, the effort has been rebuffed by Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the public health impact of higher emissions.
The EPA website says that breathing in air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The city council wants a community space
The decision was made in the end: by two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a community room in the future senior housing estate.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: the purchase agreement for the still missing plot has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time for the land to be taken over by the parish, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common space.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - about 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square metres of floor space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a community space should not be provided as a meeting place only for residents of senior housing, but open to the community.
For example, the word "trick-coffee" was spreading.
The decision, which was taken last autumn by allocating funds for the current budget, is being sweetened by the possibility of support.
The building is in the redevelopment area.
The establishment of a community room, reports Tjaden, would be eligible for 60 percent of the 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, which would signal to the investor that he is not going to be put to the test in this respect, provides that both saddle roofs, which are based on the surrounding construction, and cantilever roofs, which reduce the height of the canopy and make the construction more economical, would be possible.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation.
If it helps, he'll pass the board unanimously.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many private buildings that you don't get very far with, but you lean out the window at the common room, she says: "I'm getting hard with it".
Yvonne Staiger is strongly in favour of the Community space, but she is absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees this as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the purchase of land does not give a subsidy, but gives a real marketable equivalent in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staiger's request to split the draft decision accordingly is supported by three parties.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
Car crash: Cyclist thrown on the road
An 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car in Garath on Wednesday while crossing the road and was seriously injured.
Police said the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bicycle on the bike path of the Black Road from Hilden at 12.20pm.
The senior wanted to cross the roadway at the height of the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A female driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old female helper.
The man was thrown out onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by ambulance.
Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup will be without him: David Alaba has to drop the game against Dortmund.
Due to staffing concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first match of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Super Cup against the cup winner.
The staffing concerns of German football record champions Bayern Munich are growing before the Supercup on Saturday (20:30/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to give up David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
The Munich team also lacks Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
Ancelotti has blamed the team's physical condition and lack of balance for the five defeats in the last six Tests.
"We know we are not in the best physical shape", Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time".
But the 58-year-old believes he'll be able to improve his performance in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will display these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play smart", said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German heavyweights is enthralling to fans.
The match was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) said on Friday.
♪ Walking in the resin from star to star ♪
The first national "star trail" is to be built in Harz.
This is planned by the St. Andreasberg Observatory.
There's been a planetary route in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star trail" would meet the information needs of many visitors to the harz, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
Members want to put up tables along the planned route, with information on stars and constellations.
In a first phase, the association plans to have "well-accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz by 2018.
The following are in question: St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeis and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented by the Internet.
This is why good cellular reception is important when selecting a location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the path of the stars will be expanded step by step.
"The path of the stars gives viewers a wealth of information, such as the physics of individual stars", the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star is brighter than another, even though it is much farther away.
It also tells you in which constellation a selected star is and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are clearly visible to the naked eye from there.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, the University has been developing something similar to the planned dwarf star - the planetary way.
Starting at Gebhard's Hotel in the Goethehallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" site in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The planets' poles, including Pluto at the end of the cycle, are arranged at exactly one billion to two billion in distance and scale.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, standing exactly 75 meters away, measures at least 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is well over four kilometers.
While sunlight takes about eight hours to reach Pluto, it takes pedestrians a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be "perfect scale".
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
"I've been up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that tall.
I'm short for 140.
I'd like to go down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko agreed to the offer.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to set a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in the fight against Jorge Linares' winner Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans were asking for it", Garcia said, later expressing openly that he would fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they 're ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-time champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was on showing punching power, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be fought.
No other fight has generated so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to be working on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
Four injured from tire tracks
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 16:30 p.m. just outside the market square junction, presumably after a tire failure.
The car swerved right into the cliff, where it overturned and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the first aid of the injured by the emergency services, the A7 was closed in the northern direction for about an hour, after which traffic could be diverted on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain is better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 start to the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation will bring points to Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result, too, if it had not been for the two opponents' goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"It was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue", says the Fortuna defender.
The three-chain chain is also to be further optimized in the orefield.
And one goal after another, the fortunes won't catch up.
"For the future, no one will stand next to Michael".
Hoffmann is convinced that his team, even after the experience in preparation, will do better with the three-string than with the four-string.
"I don't know how we're going to play in Aue", says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident, "because we have players in the three-way tie for the half-way spot in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well", Hoffmann said.
"But the prerequisite is that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many mistakes in the setup".
Of course Hoffmann is going to Aue to win the game.
"But I don't know if you can say that after a draw, it was a bad start.
The performance could be fine", Hoffmann said.
"But if we can get four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we can certainly talk about a proper start to the season".
His coach didn't want to know.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days", said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, only because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game", Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes that the Aue players might even be a little fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are right now", says Fortuna's defender.
The Rhineland-Hungary team will be the favourites to face each other at the Aue Stadium, which is almost finished.
"We're wiping them out just because we're entitled to be in the top six is nonsense", says Funkel, whose record is quite positive after only one defeat against Aue in nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start", explains Fortunas' head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous".
And so Funkel doesn't want his players to see anything on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests published
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new medical method of assessing their age show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years old.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.
They are to make the age assessment more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics from the past months, the numbers are pretty constant", he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person being tested was 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 this year.
The method of medical ageing, in which wisdom teeth are x-rayed and knee joints are MRIed and then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that's the kind of measurement that should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it is about 10 percent".
Full of the plan
The work on the three bridges on the 108 road between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete component was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good on time, it's going great", says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the department of roads and transport at the government office in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach, which were in need of repair.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.
It is a concrete arch bridge, clad in red sandstone, and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now reached its prime.
The three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated to ensure their stability and traffic safety.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They're made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-meter-wide and seven-tonne-weight so-called bridge cap on its north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a perimeter fence, which is also used as a working road.
A 2.20-meter-wide bridge cap will be installed on the southern side of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian path should follow it.
The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, patented by the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the Lauterbach construction site required special finesse.
Because there's also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed of the project by means of leaflets in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the farm building and the collector's weigher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
It's all funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented at the Volkaneifel Circuit (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully shows its flag on this day, because the AfD invites the "great campaign act" according to a poster in the Rondell town hall in Gerolsteiner.
And it's starting with well-known names - like Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the federal election on September 24th, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on the ground hours before the event starts, don't want to listen to the AfD students, they want to demonstrate.
The motto is "The Eifel stays colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Fountain Square, but now it takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and so directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that presents itself.
And what really pleases Christa Karoli, chair of the One World Forum and one of the main organizers, is that "it's amazing how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including an "Old German potato salad that even the AfD could easily eat", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and they are present at the train station, which is only a few meters from the venue.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried to organize such an event and got the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for parking in Daun, but was turned down because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes already built.
Now, the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
He said: "This is the people's right, the main thing is that it stays peaceful".
It does: around 8 p.m. a band is playing at Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers are in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far, officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event is a little over an hour long, the guests in the lobby have a longer breath, but there's also a clean-up call shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can stop - no special incidents.
The trumpet is blowing the trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfhacher trumpeter Frederic Belli will be held in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore meets a classical German education with roots in the blues music.
Both soloists have won prizes in numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in leading European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both are united by the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new costume with the two, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz choirmaster Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing are mixed into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core programme was first presented in Freiburg this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart speaks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything", Kristen Stewart is quite open about her bisexuality.
"When I bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ended in bitter breakup.
Despite all this, the brunette actress told Harper's Bazaar: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After their separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and believed in it seriously.
So it's never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously".
She was particularly affected by it, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school, when she preferred to dress like a girl: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a baby.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and I think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'
She is particularly reluctant to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public".
The governor of West Virginia announces he's switching parties.
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change parties.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, with much prayer and much thought, I will tell you... today, as a citizen of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor".
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to the Republicans", Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game".
Mr. Trump has made a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes says is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "The change of party by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again".
"With only 15 governments and the fewest legislative bodies in history under control, the announcement by Governor Justice is just the latest rejection of a party that is top-down without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message", RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he described as Russia's obvious apology for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re-designed".
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think there was progress, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-engage Russia", Coe said.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
IAAF Task Force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to operate, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning for fallen soldiers in Mali
At a memorial service in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, some 1,000 people remembered the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral on Thursday under strict security.
The cause of the crash, which has not yet been clarified, was not mentioned by Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU).
She described the two pilots as "excellent in their field".
"We bow before the supreme sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany", she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse were killed in Mali, West Africa, on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were taken to Germany and on Thursday, accompanied by a bodyguard of the Bundeswehr, were taken to the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Fritz.
At noon, only the family members in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral ceremony began with the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
The Hessen government also appointed Volker Bouffier (CDU) as prime minister and Volker Wieker, the inspector general of the Bundeswehr, as minister of defence.
Mourners laid roses, and relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlers and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in the field.
The Chief of Staff had helped set up the Tiger fighter helicopter operations in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, then no one could".
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the implementation of the programme.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states", she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken from the cathedral.
The Bundeswehr did not say when or where they would be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn 't want to be buried next to his wife .
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family announced this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard had already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
But he has no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of how unhappy he was with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he wanted to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also gave up the title of "Prince husband".
Since Henrik did not get the title and the job he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will be is still unclear.
He does not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his future wife was always the object of popular sympathy, Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik wrote about his early years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluid, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knitted socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, which had a reputation in this country as the hallmark of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed content with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a snap election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
The Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick re-election of the Landtag after losing the red-green majority in the government, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday he spoke in favour of the dissolution of parliament.
The surprising departure of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had previously plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not being nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she said in Hannover on Friday.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the European Parliament is not left without its own voice.
The CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony parliament, while the SPD and Greens would have 68.
Until now, the ratio was the other way around.
The new parliament is elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decide as soon as possible to dissolve itself.
The CDU group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its next course of action.
The Land Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag withdraws the confidence of the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally examined", said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace, once they have been legally examined".
Thümler called Twesten's move "but somewhat curious".
The politician herself emphasized: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She described herself as a Black-Green supporter.
The Greens called on the renegade deputies to return their mandate in the Landtag.
"We naturally expect her to return her mandate to the Landtag, which she received through the green list of states, with immediate effect", state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
The Green Group chairman Anja Piel said: 'We deeply regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten.'
I am not going to go into detail on this.
"Even in the absence of any substantive differences, we cannot understand this step".
The Socialist Party's candidate for Chancellor, Martin Schulz, condemns the move by the Lower Saxony Green MP, Elke Twesten, to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of the Red Green", the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The exit twist cost Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her wounded vanity and frustration puts her personal interests before the good of the country", criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty game of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it".
The Dutch CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MPs that Elke Twesten be admitted to the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career memories to falsify the result of the 2013 parliamentary elections.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a slim majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous insects, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could this scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
The Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), is speaking in an interview with the German Editorial Network (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a good look at the eggs in their refrigerator and check the stamping.
The Federal States shall publish on the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de the latest information on the batches of eggs concerned.
The eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we know at present, a health hazard is virtually out of the question.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the informant is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food safety is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house was immediately set up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the German involvement became known.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe for circulation and health.
Eggs which exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg are not marketable.
However, unfertilized eggs may be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the factories.
Are producers and consumers in the same boat?
As far as is currently known, the producers are not directly liable.
Rather, they must expect economic losses due to alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it just the staff or is it also the logical competence?
It was the official controls that uncovered the operation.
But the truth is that food fraud and energy crime can never be 100% eliminated.
This is why it is crucial to investigate such incidents thoroughly and to hand them over to the prosecutor's office where there may be criminal offences.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to give me a full explanation.
Is the regular alerting of food scandals really necessary?
The consumer has the right to only secure and marketable food.
When an unlicensed insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid to be granted to the Community.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the introduction of a new type of control system for the production of foodstuffs.
This must be done consistently and with great effort at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter promptly and completely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar 's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.
The European Union has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the beneficiary of the aid.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money available to get Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on player acquisitions, but must counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - was to become a harder business.
The Commission notes that the aid is not compatible with the internal market.
And although Platini fell out of favour with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely be tightening the rules for the future", Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the annual balance sheet can show the amount of EUR 44,4 million for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Manchester City-owned Abu Dhabi, face the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was fined €60 million (then $82 million), later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the squad for the 2014/15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outwit its financial supervisors by inflating their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
The Commission notes that the aid is limited to the minimum necessary to cover the costs of the construction of the stadium.
The Commission notes that the aid is not compatible with the internal market.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee to Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a move could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant to take into account any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not had any preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the Region.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The association expects that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and they tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fairness because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country".
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has been making board chocolates for the Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration is about to come to an end: The airline is resubmitting the order.
Meike Fuhlrott, a Swiss spokeswoman, confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "NordwestSchweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to the current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected and quality checked every two to three years.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey", said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small, red and white, 14 gram packed shotguns are distributed to passengers each year by flight attendants before landing.
The Swiss company did not want to say anything about the cost.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume in Northwest Switzerland at CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary has an annual turnover of around CHF 1 billion.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious contract.
The Swiss do not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
The SDA was unable to contact the largest Swiss chocolate producer for comment.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had worked with Hug to supply the chocolate tablets.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago when it started working with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class passengers are treated to delicacies from Confiserie Sprüngli, business-class passengers are treated to Schoggi from Lindt and economy-class passengers are treated to Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolat Frey on short-haul routes, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national championship qualifier and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia is in the spotlight in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This re-telling of history is nostalgic for the glory days of the characters in the '80s, for the '90s grunge era (when pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves -- that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" did surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids who are growing up - they still managed to make it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more of a cast-iron principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the '90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character is poking through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The kind Coop, now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie.
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-executed impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the field trips are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's lower lip from "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old crackpot.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a sort of recurring "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the gang attending the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Comrade Detective on Amazon now brings back a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde", and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring war iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gigs to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes for a decent game of "Find the Voice".
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama -- a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved -- that it often plays out as one.
Six long episodes, it's dragging on, and the comedy isn't fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited down to a shorter length, could deliver its agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make anything a bait for a goose.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent story and with theirs.
Fight against the drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking down the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor's office Constance announced on Friday.
The arrest of 15 defendants, aged between 25 and 77, has already led to arrest warrants.
The authorities also seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German warrants were issued for the two Italian suspects.
They're probably being extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
Over 300 police officers were on duty.
Members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The investigation targeted mainly Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be blamed on the gang.
Wise complains about large gaps in the register of foreigners
'Data of citizens who should not be there': According to a report, the foreigners' register in Germany has significant flaws.
This leads to sometimes serious misjudgments in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government's refugee officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has reportedly pointed out large gaps in the Central Register of Aliens.
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to "sometimes serious mistakes" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis published in the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register reportedly contains 10 million foreign nationals, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreigners' authorities in Germany.
The data were not maintained adequately and the quality of data was not good in parts.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should not appear in the register anymore".
"Inflawed data entry can significantly slow down return processes", the report continues.
The statistics on people who have to leave the EU also include EU citizens who would not have to leave at all.
However, such misallocations led to "a distorted debate on the treatment of those who are obliged to leave", the analysis said.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they have arrived from there.
This is according to an internal document of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The document therefore states that the BAMF is re-introducing such procedures 'in relation to families with children, with the exception of infants and young children, to Italy as of 1 June 2017'.
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically impossible, the newspaper said, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Convention, the EU country they first reach is responsible for refugees.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country may send him back to the country of entry.
The Office now explains: "The reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has now increased significantly".
The Commission has also made a number of recommendations to the Council and the Commission.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these promises to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back under the Dublin Agreement.
The House of Commons's left-wing spokeswoman, Ulla Jelpke, criticised the decision: "Families with children are threatened with conditions of reception that violate human rights and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already made available by the blood donation service to other people.
At least by the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community recognizes multiple willingness to donate blood at the town council meeting.
"It's brilliant how our bodies are designed for this, and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even more selflessly", emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people", explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRC), because the preserves are broken down into their components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we had the second best result with 114 donors", said the DRC district head of preparedness.
Apparently, the move to the theater a few years ago led to higher attendance.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for each of their 50 blood donations.
Half as many were registered by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave 500 millilitres of their life-saving juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" as it maintained interest rates on family income amid increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,7% and for 2018 to 1,6%, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be necessary in the coming years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit, and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
MEPs also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide an additional £15 billion under this system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption".
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and "a little more" than the markets expected.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank also stressed that the increase would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are 1.9% and 1.7% respectively, as compared with the forecasts for May.
It maintained its growth forecast of 1,8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros.
The decision remains unchanged after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP rose in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank expects a slight recovery towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little encouragement for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening will first get worse before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy could not "prevent" the fall in income in the next few years, but added that wages would recover "significantly" by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully catch up with prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest ruling on interest rates, calls for an interest rate increase had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen in the past month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said this was expected and would pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess of its 2% target was "wholly" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "The recent drop in swap rates is likely to make the mortgage market more competitive as lenders look for business and end the year in a positive light.
The market is particularly good for those where existing deals are expiring and new mortgages are being taken out, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular".
The NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the NHS through an initial three-year trial of an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, with further clinics to follow in October before it is rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day, about two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a GP can also register for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the extensive and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity".
Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at the needy and vulnerable, offers the potential to change the UK HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individual controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now has to be to get the trial done quickly across the country and to ensure that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test drug is available, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people living with HIV".
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitation in implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stopping the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people living with HIV and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
The great life: half-timbered and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell them.
"I used to live in a much larger room in Knightsbridge with my ex", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made a proposal that day".
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request", she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the puzzle.
"The steel industry is quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of laying the steel in such a way that it was at the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with much extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper-lit window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the tone for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At either end, a short corridor is mirrored to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not being used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it", explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, MDF-lined door.
"It's counterbalanced, so when you push the door up, it slides very slightly".
By cleverly using space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom, and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the land - or how your property is valued", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor".
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart".
It shows that a good design and increased square footage can transform an apartment from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave.
Brothers fighting over a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clear up the division of their property and business assets.
Paul had been planning to retire from the family business since 2014, but a heated debate over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says that means Colin owns $316 million in real estate and Paul owns $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The splits Colin proposed left him with what I thought were the best objects", he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, Paul claims, excluded him from.
Colin argues that this is not true, but instead accuses Paul of mismanaging some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the first priority", he wrote.
The costs are rising in this case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with top lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms owned by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "became bitter over the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has been very reserved, despite being a former AFL board member and according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin texted back to say, "I really can't say much", because the case was in court.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take our family name to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote a letter to the court saying he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute", he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution".
By Friday, that hope seemed to have passed.
"Our case will be decided by the courts in the near future", Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to curb the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even path.
Here 's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information".
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media giant.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV commercials are still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from places that were persuasive", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise".
I'll take it from here.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel if they hadn't intervened.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his associates have managed to keep him out of trouble on several occasions, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House that is made up of competing parties are constantly trying to push their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico, which is very much concerned with this matter, reported in May that advisers preferred to give the President dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is eager to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or for not providing concrete evidence or for making false accusations in the past and retracting them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did that work out?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
Maybe he'll prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the public's help is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending out (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are not known, the public is hoped and asked for information.
Europol reported on Friday on the operation following the 'EU Most Wanted' advent calendar of the winter.
The experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
They compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least 11 of them based on information after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to the "Millionaire's Row"
Some of the wealthiest landlords in the West Midlands are once again on the battlefield with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the council to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travelers parked their 20 campervans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the "Millionaire's Row".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after being thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their incursion.
The group tactfully found a gap in the defense and pushed their vehicles through an unobstructed section to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the Solihull Council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent on from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be forced to act by shame, because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on, and are back again.
More arrived last night, probably more today".
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lectures to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal taxes if the council can't even stop it".
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, only to be robbed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen in the park area".
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised campsite in the countryside across Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal steps to ensure they move as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case".
From Birkenhof to the Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is now the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 resulted in the loss of around 30 000 overnight stays per year and also in the loss of income from the short-term levies.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as a gathering place, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being housed by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel site.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the town council.
But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel's location and spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star-plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joy Cities object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They're called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
At the former Birkenhof Hotel, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for some time, and when you enter the building, you can see the extensive renovation work being done.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were torn down, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is one construction site.
There's a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel", Thomas Scherer told the newspaper.
Everything is to be renovated in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should be "very civic" in the words of Thomas Scherer.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry".
The facilities include a swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room.
The aim is not to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but at an upscale downtown level, emphasises Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, is planning to expand its facilities, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He's already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The City's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same page".
When asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer did not want to specify.
He estimates just under a million euros.
The external installations are also being brought forward, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be built in a courtyard, accessible from the public restaurant.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia case: US special investigator calls for grand jury
In the Russia case involving US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has been working for the past few weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The paper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller's investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow.
The investigation is focused on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the campaign.
Mueller also reportedly began to probe Trump's personal and business environments.
The Washington Post reported a few weeks ago that the special counsel had personally gone to the center and was investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to examine the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to prosecute.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually used when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called upon by the public prosecutor's office to summon persons for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, summonses have already been issued to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that persons involved in the meeting had been asked to give evidence.
They should also provide documents.
Trump Jr. was joined by Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on U.S. television that the appointment shows Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly if necessary.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that the grand jury is called in to decide whether to press charges.
However, the establishment of the panel marks the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amidst the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a complete fabrication", Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he had no knowledge of the grand jury's appointment.
He stressed that the latter also usually work in secret.
The White House supports any measure that would expedite the work of the Special Rapporteur in a "fair" way.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that there will be no investigation into the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement continued.
Mueller was not hired until after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this impeachment, accusations against Trump had become loud, that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure about the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House was gathering material against the special investigator and his staff.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump would fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as the Watergate case involving the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller is in a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's behest.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills Thursday that would stop the special counsel from being fired so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floating in the Antarctic
In the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg nearly seven times the size of Berlin has broken off the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The giant, weighing over a trillion tons and covering 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting northward and will probably take two or three years to melt.
At 175 kilometers (110 mi) long and up to 50 kilometers (31 mi) wide, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
He's not a danger to humans.
Researchers say it is unclear to what extent climate change played a role in the iceberg's collapse.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) in a background report.
Many researchers believe that this may be related to global warming.
The colossus that has now broken off was once part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
The sea ice is a shellfish that floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and breakdown was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, as the front edge has never retreated as far as it does now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under stress and may break apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels, since they float on water, and ice displaces as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers are flowing directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Research Project (Midas).
Larsen C is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with an area of almost 50,000 square kilometres, according to the AWI.
It is up to 700 meters thick at the transition from the mainland, and about 200 meters at the front edge of the open ocean.
It breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural process and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position", said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the largest retreat since records began", he confirmed.
Scientists are debating whether the Larsen C ice shelf will grow again or decline and possibly collapse in the long term, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many Antarctic ice shelves have collapsed.
This long ridge of Antarctica extends toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic ice sheet has shrunk by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950's.
The decrease was due to the rise in temperature.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants a flat rate on staff
As it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the withdrawal from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the county day has winked through 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, 17 more trainees have completed their first day of work.
The teaching positions at the circle are obviously very coveted.
Applications were made for some 620 places to be allocated this year.
However, the district still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
The search includes doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the district day, together with the FDP and the UWG, to tackle the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The management is to 'develop a recruitment and development strategy' at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to address the shortage of candidates in a future-oriented way.
The overall approach should be both internal and external, should include concrete measures for newcomers and a training initiative, call for the CDU, the FDP and the UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
This is a real "public employer competition".
In addition, a large number of employees are leaving the service because of illness or old age.
So it is high time to act so that no more vacancies remain.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the CDU's leader, and his party go beyond the joint motion.
He recently surprised the other parties by publicly calling into question the coverage of staff costs at the local parliamentary elections.
Völker wants all options to be explored to get out of the local employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a basic tariff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns belonging to the district", says Völker.
The CDU is thus trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than the public service tariff actually provides.
The wages are currently strictly prescribed, and increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level based on years of work.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up where employees would take care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitutes.
The problem is not least that the number of asylum seekers is increasing: they have too little staff.
Italy raises the tone for NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work", said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on the detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are being made at this time once we have gathered all the information and assess the situation".
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the 'Jugend Rettet' boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking onboard migrant tugs delivered directly from traffickers and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such encounter was alleged to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overstepping the authority of the Italian coast guard, which is monitoring the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
The code of conduct requires boats such as the Iuventa to have an Italian police officer on board, in particular, to supervise their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "substantial changes or impediments" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after rescue operations had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weiler bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome addition.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
There followed vantage points, some on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatine forest and the upper levels.
In between, there were longer climbs, which rewarded long trials.
On the second day, we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, perspective to perspective was aligned, linked by "smooth" trials and moderate climbs.
The last two days have seen a lot of high altitude.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins, and shelters offered welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, bikers inhaled healing salts in the open air inhalation room.
Neustadt was also taxed.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had seen the Palatinate forest at its best - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is gearing up for eSports
Will sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the wind and fighting over the stadium grass?
The fact is, e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans, and huge tournaments with high stakes.
This has been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area.
The first was VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which in mid-July founded an e-sports department and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB", says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "several clubs will be on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Federation will be hosting the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified for the competition.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in esports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds in particular, so that young people will still go to the stadium in the future", says the 52-year-old.
And the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be online in these markets far more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What's the point exactly?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are contested on a competitive level.
Like regular sports, leagues have long been established in which professionals compete against one another.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, eSports is already part of the official program.
But is it even a proper sport?
For many, the idea is certainly a matter of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also been dealing with this question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and the ability to react quickly.
Professional gamers should not only exercise at the console, but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to their diet.
"The fit player is a good player".
But Frobos sees problems too: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
The Commission has also been asked to examine the impact of the new rules on the use of the internet in sport.
The scientist emphasises positively the high integrating effect of e-sports.
The players are international, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consultancy firm Deloitte and the German Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) Association predicts a rapid growth of e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were thus realized in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is supposed to be 130 million.
This is not much compared with the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports "are no longer far removed from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", Deloitte advisers write.
Many countries are already farther along internationally.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the esports betting company Unicrn.
There are also things happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, Dutt says, the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany lags behind in European comparison", explains Röttgermann, the VfB board member.
Just falling into nostalgia and explaining the old days is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the association's tradition, but at the same time to orient the company towards the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world", says Dutt.
"You can't just keep saying that football is the only game that keeps things the way they always have".
Poison Eggs - The Egg Alternatives to Cooking and Baking
The scandal over poisoned eggs has now affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded by withdrawing all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven not to contain fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of writing lyrics urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, her hands folded and her eyes down as she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she deeply regrets".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said that he had not found that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness had a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that "there is not a day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity".
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having the one person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to encourage another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case gained national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You must do it, Conrad", and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention for Roy's death and ordered that she be given some sort of press to profit from the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison".
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
It's no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern is giving the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
There was something different about his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw it right away, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer were to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he held his assigned tie.
"The coach didn't announce it", the Confed Cup winner said afterwards, after his first stint as Bayern captain.
Well, the tie could have gone better than the 0-2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from Coach Kimmich could also be interpreted that way.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader of the C-eleven, which was made up of youth players, debutants and professionals just coming out of retirement.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust, whom you want to keep in good spirits.
So whoever's chosen to succeed Lahm could use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew across the field as a mini-lamh.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on his arm did the rest.
And Kimmich seemed to be the best at taking the helm in this starting formation.
He gave orders, tried to steer the unarmed troop.
He had the eye for the whole thing while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal, to overplay his lack of fitness (barely worked); Renato Sanches, to link to the achievements of the Asia tour (just worked conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
That worked out pretty good.
Süle walked alongside Kimmich, Rudy over the defense, both acting supreme.
The famous Napoli-Storm often made himself difficult, and Süle also tried to build up a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
"I was caught for this style".
The way this Bavarian world is still unfamiliar with new entrants was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crack-up statements behind his new teammates' backs.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
You just have to win every game at Bayern".
At least he doesn't have to teach the new guy that.
Alaba motivates women from the OEF
David Alaba believes in the success of our women
Austria's most famous footballer has logged in via Twitter just before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is like a clubmate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bavarian duffel might be of use to our ladies.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises the pace of knowledge
The relationship between the Land and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in office of the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Volker Wissing (FDP).
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy at TV's request - and at the same time blaming the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing is responding to the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked".
The biggest change Natus sees in infrastructure policy is the closure of motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau, which is now at the top of the country's priority list.
The Ministry hopes to have a planning approval process in place this year, and the building permit should be in place by 2021.
The West bypass of Trier also plays a role in the country's plans, which is a key requirement of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of new jobs in the EU by EUR 1 billion.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is seeking, as suggested by Wissing, a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the declining trend in German wine exports over the last decade.
The IHK also praises Wissing for being open to people who want to start their own company.
The new master bonus is an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
The award is for the master's examination and for the degree of master's degree.
The list of homework for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is a matter of quick facts, but the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, CEO of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing intends to recruit at the Mobility State-owned company, only 29 have been recruited so far.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external agencies.
Christian Baldauf, deputy leader of the CDU, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in 2017 and 2018 in maintaining national roads than proposed.
The French authorities also expect a concept from the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The Commission also stressed that the current situation in the country was disappointing.
In 2016, regional undertakings had only rated grid supply in an ICH survey with a score of 3,4.
They complained about the Internet connection and the interruptions.
Former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind energy company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she left after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as recalls.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems to neutralize diesel emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called switching devices, which could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but backtracked under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focusing on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This is the message the raft carried on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To help the visitors of Isar join us, a raft will be sailing through Munich on Saturday with a special message.
If you come to the Isar on Saturday, you'll see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach.
And this is no ordinary raft with Isar tourists.
The building inspector wants to know.
On the raft, you can see a large information screen.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the ISAR visitors.
The motto "True love is"... is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Last summer the raft crossed the Isar, and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve more respectful and environmentally-conscious behaviour.
Murder's nose and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was one of the most published cartoonists of his time, and the tubby noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he excelled in drawing greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job", he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in Star and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded figures of Mordillo are seen in drawings of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London, and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits at the drawing table, according to his own statements, working almost ten hours a day.
His funny figures continue to be widely distributed throughout the world, including calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, stuffed animals, and watches.
For six years he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favorite animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-feet-long as his opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is set to hit theaters in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me", says Mordillo.
He's not writing the script.
So he's more into the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender plant in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbe that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them".
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive to vacationers, but it is also in high demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped ones and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil".
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhône is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Shopkeepers, merchants, vagrants, or a camp of rural slaves are to be seen in the city center during these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and the continuing drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: taking their children, who were the target of a shell attack in 2009, to the office or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard in front of the room: adversary, neutral, ally.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of being on the government or cartel payroll, a catalogue of criminals who are making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as the bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are among them: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books about drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle cases of journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists says it has only initiated two criminal cases.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop", he says.
"Until we know why, we'll distrust everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to run wild in Culiacan.
But there's practically nothing but silence on the Valdez issue.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds, with rival factions fighting to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, every day, one or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug lords that are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes into the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken by guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the Sons, for suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was working as a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he and five colleagues joined forces to form Riodoce and sold a $50 stake.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem", Bojorquez said.
In time, the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexico's drug story wherever it took him.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"You must take on the task that is yours as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in front of so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and sit at the same table.
Now they ask, was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you're involved with your wives, your children, your clean shops, your secret runways", to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed", Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "Smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened".
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Suddenly, cell phones were not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees were meeting for security training, and days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the 40 degrees Fahrenheit (104°C) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were hired by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the famous former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that was doing a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of politics for almost a century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to report on previous incidents at the restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column the best-informed source on the abduction.
"We would have known what happened before", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off".
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, because the staff had become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the next morning to a protest for another journalist at the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests, it's his.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, Director Bojorquez is off to Washington, D.C. trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be re-hired by the government because she's worried that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials in the past year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up", Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my reports".
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets, looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it's a daily dance of risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office, drinking beer, when all of a sudden their phones started ringing.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the ship, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile.
The next day, the cover had to be changed.
Sirens sounded nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who were guarding to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to the street to report".
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even tell that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "disturbed past".
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers, who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while digging in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years tracking the wild animal inside the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) earth.
After all this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little, you might almost believe it was asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered in armor and resembles a walking tank, it was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shells and armor over its body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although contrast shading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of boreal opelta far exceeds that of animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the contrasting shade -- think deer, zebras, or belt animals -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were probably much more widespread inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal", said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as it did in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just blink a little, you could almost believe he's asleep".
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long (11.5 m) monster weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that after dying, the boreal opelta sank into the sea and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it's the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed through western Canada until a flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy plates of armor that support the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is on his side, his five fingers are spread out upward.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the storm: mass car bombing on A8: Many injured
A serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car crash.
There are numerous injuries, miles of traffic jams and gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass car bombing late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police reports, about 5 p.m. between the junction points of Adelhausen and Odelhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district), nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of casualties was not immediately known.
The injuries were mild to moderate, a police spokesman said.
A large convoy of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 has been completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
A rear road of about ten kilometres formed in the direction of Munich.
According to an AZ reporter, there were also massive impairments on the opposite track - caused by numerous gaffers.
The fire department recorded the license plates of the drivers, who now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
A car transporter and a passenger car had collided.
A rescue helicopter was en route to the crash site.
German railway: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced: you're sitting in a train and you're asleep, not knowing what's going on.
Or you're immersed in your work and you're having a brilliant thought.
And then, puff.
The driver comes and wakes you up in a rude way or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Check your tickets.
But the days of interruptions are over.
The German railway is currently testing driverless ticket control.
You just confirm by phone that you've taken your seat and you devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"If the offer is accepted, we'll expand it.
It will then be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year", said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in", the railroad calls it, is the unattended ticketing.
However, to use them, you must meet certain requirements: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked a ticket online - which most passengers already do.
You also have to have bought it through the rail app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the way comfort check-in works is this: You get on the train, you look up your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers will then see an electronic devaluation button.
Train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket office at Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already revalued online ticket.
So you can sleep on, work on, keep quiet.
The 'check-in' has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is intended to benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel without ticket checks by our train attendants, you can check in on DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their journey on the train more personal", says Michael Peterson, marketing director at DB Fernverkehr.
Secondly, "and our employees have more time than they do today to respond to the individual needs of their customers".
Those who frequent trains know that, along with delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you, or at least one of your fellow passengers, do not have all the documents you need to declare your online tickets valid.
Either the credit card or the ID card or some other document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train crew and passengers, leading to bad mood in the compartment or the main area and delays in checking one's ticket, and ultimately taking time away from the driver to attend to other matters.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
The airport is also served by ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been released.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she was renting and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old, and it's still lying in the street", it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to go back to tweeting about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were pictures of the police band and people screaming, and a man claiming to be Brown's father, carrying a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed of a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another cop unsecured his rifle and yelled, "I'm gonna kill you... animals all".
"That's not usual", Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and can call typical".
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried".
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two of them would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters starting on the 11th.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation they had had countless times earlier this morning about the black experience and the black condition.
"Remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her", Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is the culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised to believe it.
It has to be well-developed, not just activism and organization, but also knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different than the next black woman's child.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice by keeping her away".
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a spot across from the police station that became a campground as the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely after 9/11, " she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequality in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come".
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Are you trying to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism has been fueled by countless cases of people, often white people, in a community that profited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals who followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk", Davis said.
"That's the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented".
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not about a messianic leader, but about a community coming together", Folayan said - she turned out to be the most outspoken participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", Ferrell said, laughing as she first saw the finished product.
"But I've come to understand that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people".
Furthermore, Ferrell's story echoes the role of black lesbian women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who have been the subject of the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have been the driving force behind the movement as a whole", Ferrell said, "and so we're constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of it all".
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy", she said.
"It's no coincidence that she was on the front lines, "because living at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel her energy through the screen".
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home: "A chaos".
Yet she clings to a song and she feels bound to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains".
From "dream" to "madness": TV viewers discussing bit-gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, even though it's not built yet.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since it was first presented in 2009.
It's hard to get cold feet about it.
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Friend Bitburg".
While some people say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Grown-madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters hope that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, which will benefit other businesses, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery will be located on the same site as the Farmers' Market Hall, where 13 direct marketers sell their products.
The construction will be finished.
The gallery builders want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and that is to say, to Beda-Platz with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years now, we have been shopping almost every week at the Farmers' Market Hall.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women.
We also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
They have it in other cities.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting".
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
The new project is not likely to be particularly low".
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothes, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many shops have been empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product is fresh, mostly directly from the producer, and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are rented out only by larger companies, because the rent there is often not affordable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear".
Wolf Fandel: "I don't like a shopping centre with a market hall.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
First of all, where will the Farmers' Market Hall go during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery actually comes at some point.
Or will the ghost Bit-gallery be able to drive all the businesses out of Bitburg before then?"
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And a shopping mall that's empty, nobody needs it.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmers' market hall, thanks to the many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the Farmers' Market Hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear".
A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, you can see many faces -- white, black, and brown, almost imperceptibly alike -- hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clips from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic communications through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was overturned by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, by algorithmically analyzing the DNA that Manning extracted and creating 30 portraits of what someone might look like with this genomic data, has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual, comment not only on the formability of DNA data -- the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations -- but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six counts of violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Prison had so suppressed her image that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie of Manning visibly uncomfortable in a driver's seat wearing a platinum-blond wig - that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just coming off the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when she got an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some sort of portrait to accompany this article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time, and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to get a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which the president would reverse Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually, just days after the book was published, demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy reunion.
There is something profound and powerful about the opening of the exhibition as Donald Trump wages a war against government informants and transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to address.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said, "Things happen for a reason".
In an artistic statement engraved on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence -- a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and A's, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped that by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides in the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon) to show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work Spurious Memories is also seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so here are 30 of them".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the comic book mentioned above.
It shows Manning emerging from the United States' disciplinary barracks like King Kong, with a pay phone in her hand.
"If they chill your speech, they've won", it says.
"So never shut up".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote me", said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it".
Manning hasn't seen the exhibit in person yet -- as it was predictably predicted in the comic book -- but if she does, she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulators, who are swarming like hordes of protesters.
It was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5'2, Manning's height), where their genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation".
Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was fatally stabbed in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were arrested Monday on charges of murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County district court records.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after multiple stab wounds.
A community alert system issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers got a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stab wounds as a homicide, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and banned from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation", said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way imaginable".
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to turn themselves in.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship", Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
"We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be implemented.
'At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard", Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap for Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist".
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted to past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be re-commissioned.
Aldi won 't be selling eggs for a while .
This was reported by the groups.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
From now on, only eggs that have been tested negative for fipronil-containing antifungal agents should be delivered to Aldi.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to his clients.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett tried to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, deceptive.
And even though she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity", said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called outside people for help.
A new breed of human resource start-ups is emerging to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Rescue said she gained a better insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and surveys of specific teams, it provides a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down why.
Companies are starting to realize that they need to stay on top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber to get caught up in scandals, ever since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber scandal in bad credit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
And if the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has caught the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, it can face costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee fluctuations and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or an email to the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue employee complaints.
Now, with Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - like discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience", said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group at Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation".
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical violations in the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until social media took its toll that companies realized that you couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, charging companies recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that is getting the nod from venture capitalists who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and exciting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making that company successful", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement are important according to the experts of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you're not going to follow, employees are going to be like, "Did you really hear me?
You take care of it?
And who do you care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems, thanks to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
Ruby Tuesday gives the company new insights into its workforce, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee engagement in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people", Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose businesses.
NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's almost 11:00 p.m. and a bunch of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their shirt tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a large part of the team, these minutes of inactivity are a lunch break.
Players who have enrolled in the summer courses will return for their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys over the next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day practice to ease the burden on the players, and they've actually extended their days - at least until the finals on Friday.
So the first three UCLA practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the already packed schedule of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day where the Bruins moved the start of camp almost a week after last season and during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood did practice.
They're scheduled to hold 18 practice sessions throughout August, 20 of which are before the start of formal preparations for their September opener against Texas A&M.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging", Mora said.
And they just pushed through, they keep on pushing, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great".
UCLA will end its practice once the camp is over, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once those rooms are available during the season.
"We will use our security", Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people would rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security there, and we have security at parking lot eight.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan".
Facebook wants to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday, in an effort to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers, who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential elections, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that it would launch a test of the new fact-checking system in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share", Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related article" feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its more recent past, Little Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy home in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a ragged Yorkshire man with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says sadly.
"What a personal relationship, holding this letter in my hand".
A Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by a different emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book to be based on an archive: he wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins", he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because back then, you lit a fire for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has the effect of being there himself.
Oh, I like the archives!"
For someone who is so beaten up by old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and has lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overestimated my welcome a little bit") all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas' heads on the walls and the bottles that had been in the ditch for centuries.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes even the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he drank whiskey and started writing.
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just starting to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that the two families fought over.
Boys, let it all go".
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into wider English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion would be a good start.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler,' which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was not made until years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, continually taking on debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys with a talent for recruiting heirs".
After his time at the castle is over, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again", he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to get back to fucking life".
Campaign launched: over 300-year-old chapel of the Virgin Mary in Rhöndorf covered up
The city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof mark (Thursday's roundup) by covering up the 301-year-old Mary Chapel in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan a secret.
The campaign is to culminate in a festival on the island of Grafenwerth at the end of August.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the organizers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!) ", they write on their website, which was launched yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
We are firmly convinced that as citizens of Bad Honnefer we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city".
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to make a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique characteristic".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is paying a median five-figure sum for its new rooftop brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) holds a meeting in Ankara on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, it's a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was held at the Prime Minister's office, rather than at the General Staff building as before.
The five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs now took part in the deliberations, chaired by the Head of Government.
That's why the YAS had the most civilians.
The government is pulling the strings in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
The 486 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt have been on trial in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the coup attempt as a "gift from God" as it gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort at the Military Headquarters".
The General Staff is concerned about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested in the lifting of the head-covering ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The military and security forces are still being cleaned up.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree firing 7,395 more government officials, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
Generals were once considered the true masters of the land.
Three times they made coups, citing their role as guardians of the world's order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the military, not least by invoking the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the coup attempt for fear of persecution warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that were true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
The Turkish army is not ready to fight.
NATO diplomats say the leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weak".
Washington changes the rules for the green card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, according to media reports.
It includes reducing legal immigration to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and backed by the president.
The bill is to be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens from other countries".
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and who demonstrate skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for racetrack shuttle
The future of the racetrack shuttle has been debated over and over again in recent months - now it's going to be very fast.
The tourist railway is to be built on the run-down track before the end of the year.
To ensure the long-term future of the racetrack, construction work on the track is due to start later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committing itself to this connection, which is especially important for tourism", State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the track at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes 75%.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the South Tyrol Railway as operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the negotiation of the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards", Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
The raceway shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
In recent months, a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to allow regular bookings in the future.
The route is also heavily congested.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier, a new report comes out on the technological advances in sex robots.
Yes, I did.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking its rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipple, and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them and we're going to see them a lot more", said Mr Sharkey at the launch of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable partners to silicone-skin robots that feel warm - with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the color of the robot's eyes to the shape of his nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's even more disturbing that many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy", with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as best as it can", the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or she may be "in the mood!"
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape, when you step on Frigid Farrah, are the most worrying.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will not, of course, own sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain temporarily on the fringes of consumer culture.
But what leaks from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times in which we live.
And a lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to be.
There's a certain overlap, though, that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there's a president in the White House who's boasted about sexually assaulting women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to real women as realistically as technically possible (although with porn star proportions).
The designers want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to cut a long story short, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots don't represent real women.
You can't just part with your partner or walk away.
They have no mediation or background, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 parlance, maids.
Trump's great accomplishment?
He 's making Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .
It's become a commonplace of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the American electorate have also divided families in the microcosm.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with advice on how to deal with the horror of relatives voting for Trump.
We all seem to be working hard to get our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticeable is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a long history of dealing with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin with whom she fought for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the deforming effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're talking about the scary possibility that one day his crap won't repel us.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality compared to his standards.
I find myself these days being struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in fact, seem to be very mild offenses compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York City Parks Department carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are grumpy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders in fear - extremely dark, and the creaking music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointing: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are getting too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not living up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss Cottage - the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub doesn't count - but a major traffic circle in North London.
But the Central Park carousel is still a weirdly magical experience, because here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two women in their 40s can ride it and have a great time.
If I could have rated the merry-go-round, I would have given him the full score, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was forced this week in a department store to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could use my credit card.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip -- that's to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where it is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store was standing with an apologetic grin as I tiredly experienced handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius is transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year he was hospitalized for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which prison officials say he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecution against a first-degree murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, by shooting her multiple times through a toilet booth door in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Criminal Prosecution Service said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks being sentenced to 15 years if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Arnold Bauer finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders were dismissed from Fützen and Epfenhofen for the holidays and into the further education schools.
Three of the dismissed students will go to high school, four to the real school.
The school headmistress, Angelika Sitte, welcomed the parents and public representatives at the Biesental civic centre in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school leaving, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, which grows up in a chicken farm but is then released into the wild.
The cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Barn".
Arnold Bauer found a strange egg, and he had it hatched by his hens.
Instead of a chicken coop, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered, and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and fled.
Afterwards, the third and fourth grades in Yvonne Frank's study showed a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gooklets, who carried cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young are different from the other young (chicken), but they are part of it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
He was destined to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in their new school.
The following was a thank you to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who always intervenes in the face of classroom difficulties, and the parents' representatives.
The chickens' time is over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
She ended up relying on the fourth graders.
In conclusion, all the students sang a song about summertime and vacation time.
The children were overjoyed.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the foreign ministry said, quoted by the TV channel.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal campers, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on the free campsite and are imposing heavy fines on anyone found to be staying in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks shall continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what the affected parties need to know now
How exactly does the software update happen?
Do diesel drivers have to participate?
The main questions and answers in summary.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust emissions performance of cars in the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 or lower diesel is excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives the following reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates we negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously applied only to vehicles that have cheat software", says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Vehicle Office (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when are customers informed of updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has said it will write to anyone concerned.
If an inspection is due, it will be carried out within the framework of the inspection.
How long will the restructuring take?
"It's hard to say", says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the environmental issue".
How long do you want the update to take?
The re-equipment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
I'm sure foreign manufacturers would follow suit, Smetanin said.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But in the regions where there are driving bans.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesel.
ACE advises we wait until we sell.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the laureates won't come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) becomes the first rapper to win one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
The cultural institution announced on Thursday that this year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the award ceremony along with his wife Melania.
The award-winning Lear, known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not be attending the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even deny them the means - and that offends me".
Estefan, 59, stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners of the award include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city planner, is retiring next year.
The job is already open - but suitable candidates are scarce.
Wacker's been a city planner for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work, as he says in the press conference.
He describes the varied but challenging tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
The Commission is therefore proposing to extend the period of time allowed for the implementation of the directive to the Member States.
Since Haslach acts as the lower authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the corresponding certificates.
Because that's the function the city wants to keep.
If they could no longer fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But the city and the city itself are keen on being close to the public, says Wacker, who reports on a good working environment and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the public.
In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has accumulated some important projects that he looks back on with pride.
"We're making the city liveable", he's sure of the building department and its employees.
But in the future, a variety of projects are on the agenda: the redevelopment of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will be worth about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
It's fun to work here".
The design of the building is a great deal for a city planner.
Haslach's own farm and gardening business allows for a fairly flexible response to many things.
"You can move a lot", says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as a whole is protected as a historic site, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city architect emphasized.
The city architect has a great responsibility.
He's a builder, "everything ends up on my table".
In terms of supervision and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (high-rise construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (ground-based construction) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay on for a long time: "We're looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the information provided by the City of Haslach, anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should have completed a diploma in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and should have good expertise in the fields of building and construction law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for civil engineering, building planning, land management, municipal real estate management, the Municipal Workshop with building yard and city gardening, and the Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on wires: southern track closed
According to police, the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
The damage was so severe that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking for two male offenders, and they've been looking for them since the middle of the night.
Witnesses had seen a pink scooter and a bicycle near the scene.
"This is far more than a trick", ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement, the offenders could also be fined by rail customers.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern line was able to operate without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of them for long-distance trains.
Goods trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, affecting some 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that are hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may result.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment if the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiome of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
So we sequenced the intestines of the mice, and we found six types of bacteria that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing in the mice without them.
So mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they didn't develop that kind of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells were created.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect against L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed Nemanja Matic as a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holders role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to their will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later".
Alongside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club", he added.
"I'll be happier if they get me four out of four, but they've gone to a lot of trouble".
Boeing painted the Dreamliner into the sky
The American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots took off from Seattle, Washington, but the filming started in Marquette, Michigan, and it moved across the United States in the shape of a Dreamliner, thousands of miles.
The operation lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens, it was the shape of a Dreamliner.
This whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had done this kind of advertising before.
That's how the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid.
The wind is blowing: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social-Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
The main wish of the campaigners was not to have any fire from the party headquarters, but to have no headwinds from the federal government.
Since Martin Schulz took over the party, that's changed.
Since then, the staff of the Willy Brandt House have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled provincial capitals.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year, with a headwind, wouldn't even be described in the introduction.
It was a low blow.
One by one.
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green cannot govern reliably", said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German news network RND.
The surprise resignation of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its majority to the opposition of the CDU and FDP.
The Green Party's executive director, Michael Kellner, has called on the renegade Lower Saxony Green MP, Elke Twesten, to return her mandate.
The changeover to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Every twist must immediately return her mandate", the federal executive and campaign leader of the Greens told the German editorial network RND.
"This can't be true", sighs one SPD candidate as the new job announcement reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without a majority in the government after the departure of the Green MEP Elke Twesten from the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD-Landbundes.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, that's all, the comrades of that time calmed down.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, things will be different.
And that's what happened - and it got a lot worse.
The defeat at Kiel brought the SPD to a standstill, the Düsseldorf riot brought the party to a complete collapse.
The comrades struggled to get back together in the weeks that followed.
Then, just as they had regained their courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with it came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now we have Stephan Weil.
The Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been under criticism for some time because of the VW-gas affair and his role in the Supervisory Board.
The results of the polls were poor.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more to establish a foothold in the federal government in recent weeks.
The former mayor of Hanover's desire to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden even by comrades in the circle of Martin Schulz.
They had it granted because they had promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
We have to be careful not to make the same mistakes as the Greens.
And especially not Schulz.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and in this case, above all, at the renegade Member of Parliament, Mrs Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy that Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests ahead of the interests of everyone else", says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was not elected to Parliament as a direct candidate, but on the basis of the list of the Lower Saxony Greens.
The logical consequence would be that she would give up her mandate.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
"The will of the electorate was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister", says Oppermann, who is leading the SPD in the Lower Saxony parliamentary elections, the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU member is distorting the election result", Oppermann continued.
He demanded that the background be clarified.
I want to know if there was more or if there were more promises from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Support for local core III
Those who want to renovate their aging house can soon receive support from the country.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
At the beginning of the information meeting, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg still took over two thirds of the total amount of aid.
In the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60%.
Schindler considers the renovations so far to be a "successful project" - it is important to promote interior development as well, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe government received information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The total amount of the aid is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 comes from the Land, the rest from the Municipality of Reception.
How does a rehabilitation area come about?
Schindler continues: "We will investigate where the really old houses are.
However, whether there is any interest in the area to be redeveloped is also important.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG was represented by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal-Länder programme "Social City", within the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The programme focuses on the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on a per-site basis.
The area of rehabilitation would then be finally defined in a statute.
The financial contribution period for the support measures will run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, the survey would not be carried out until September of this year, when the people involved in the rehabilitation area would be given a questionnaire to fill in.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the period of the first phase of the programme to the period from 1 January to 31 December.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban failures and deciding when and to what extent to rehabilitate them.
A notice of renovation will then be entered in the land register for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann himself would come to receive again and make an image of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the involvement of the stakeholders was a key factor in the success of the project.
That is why there will be questionnaires sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the 'Building and Land Survey', which covers, inter alia, the condition of the buildings and the plans for their renovation.
The grey questionnaire, the 'Budget and Housing' questionnaire, provides information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a dwelling.
The blue 'operation sheet' is only to be completed if the building is used for commercial purposes.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
The Commission also considers that the new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works according to the "Winddog principle" - who comes first, meets first.
You can't "save" funding for later.
Finally, photographs of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the renovation "tasteful" to those present.
British inventor puts a microchip on himself to get into house and car with a hand gesture
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to modify the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all at an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one now has both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House advertising costs the taxpayer thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data, which was provided to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklifts from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility", the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval aviation commander, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at about 7 a.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the flight from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of duty.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the event.
The records provided to TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event might violate the designation.
"One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case", the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up", the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the health care reform reform that was underway in the Senate and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political advantage is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use it for travel.
But requiring it to be used only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made In America' show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials", said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to drop the President of the United States at the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted among the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had no involvement in the display of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
The Commission also notes that the US Department of Defense (DoD) has not provided any evidence that the VH-3D was a commercial aircraft.
Unit records show the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"It is highly misleading to determine the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates of the reimbursement rates", said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations".
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things this week that are made in America", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I'm guessing that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize this".
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of them".
TC BW Neuss before a tricky task
Top-ranked player of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga enters the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Kiel against the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches still showing a flawless record, the top-ranked player in the Second Tennis League has retained his sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"It's a tight team, always playing in a very similar formation.
Especially in the back positions I find the team very good".
The main reasons for the high level and stability of Suchsdorfer SV are imports from the far north.
"The Danes and Finns may even be referring to Davis Cup stakes.
And they are also strong in doubles", says Zay, with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This is going to be difficult for us as always.
You need a good bit of luck".
The new crew for the trip to the far north is convenient.
His debut for the Blue and White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently playing in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, fails to make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who has never been defeated, was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was to be in Kiel, however, along with Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could be back in the team.
If it's not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the world junior rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In its haste to pass the law", he said, "Congress has wrapped up some unconstitutional regulations".
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was reluctant to accept the US advance.
The draft law provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the domestic OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been concerned.
The threat is huge.
However, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has 12 weapons to choose from.
The press has looked at which of the corporations could defend it and which could really hurt it.
The season 3 trailer for Narcos: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos exposing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, with the first one getting its first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful patrons, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Season three of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
Roll back: The city hires 46 kitchen workers
The city is organizing the kindergarten lunch itself.
With a permanent contact for the kids and a team assignment.
In urban day care, the clock is ticking.
As of 1 September, the City of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's day care centres (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy director of youth services, this is good news: "We all had a great time".
The cooking continues outside the home: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food chilled.
The city operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 of which children receive a hot meal at noon.
Last year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the demand is growing.
"Now, it's not just children who are cared for 45 hours a week who eat lunch in the nursery", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is valid for 35 hours of care if children stay until 2 p.m".
46 part-time workers will be working in the kitchen from 1 September: they will heat the food delivered, add salads, raw food and fruit, serve the meal individually, serve the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a fixed group", says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group establishments - determines the hours.
"The kitchen staff are now firmly part of the nursery team", says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
"This way they are much more involved and it is easier to implement simple educational concepts for the kindergarten".
Because that's what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help with the cooking".
The direct link between the kitchen and the team makes sense.
For the children too.
"They have a known force in the nursery, a person they know, not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the greenhouses - which has been the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm of improving the quality of the kitchen service, which has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between ownership and lending for the city, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not so important for about 750 people in the education sector", says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections, three women are running for the vice-presidency and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process, coinciding with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will be held to peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered to vote out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
Moving on to the TV anniversary
On the occasion of its 110th anniversary, TV Kaiseringen invites you to a short walk with coffee and cake.
The walk starts on Sunday, July 9, at 1 p.m. in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir on the Americas.
From there, it goes to the airport, to the Natter, and back through the forest to the water reservoir.
The hike takes about an hour and a half.
Afterwards, there will be coffee, cakes, cold drinks, string sauces and cheesecakes at the schoolhouse in Kaiseringen.
If you need a ride from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten, you can meet at the school in Kaiseringen.
Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men called the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, at about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old girl refused and continued with her friends.
One of the assailants then tried to seize the girl's cell phone and necklace, but failed.
Without any loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB's concern about investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
A union wants to check with the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he's invested more than £5 million in the past few years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be 'the first to know' if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to 'express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being advanced'.
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get any clarity from the General Site Manager about Tollcross's business needs and investment plans for the future is deeply affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising costs of living and chronic production decline, the east end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie.'
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: 'The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate the continued commitment from staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: 'Over the last few years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and if our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Did PSG Barcelona warn you about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record heist three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89m last season.
After leaving, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football warned of this prospect by the president of PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, there will be consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their bids for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of property number 30, causing property damage to the vehicle's lining of over 200 euros.
The Schramberg Police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, is asking for information.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
A car came up to him on the road, and the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid the road and touch the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on his VW at about 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, he was met by a car on his lane, so he had to turn right.
The Touran driver touched the dashboard.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued on without taking any notice of the accident.
According to the victim, it may be a good thing that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the vehicle responsible to contact the police station in Stolzenau on 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Dompatzen report releases brother of the pope Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases exonerates the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
So says author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Cathedral sparrows continues to generate discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", told the German press agency after the publication that he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the cathedral choirmaster Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of retired Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very good for the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of events.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the "double standard" of reporting on violence among the bishops.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The practice of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to accept it as normal", writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and that's a found food".
She also noted that in her youth "beating was a normal educational tool" "to deal with naughty children like myself".
She would find it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with reports of abuse, Brother Georg Ratzinger, the pope, often appeared.
Quite wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages) with Ratzinger.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger", says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg to investigate the matter?
A total of 547 Regensburg Dom sparrows were "highly plausible" victims of assault between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 Dom sparrows were sexually abused.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
It was especially when the students were highly emotional that the punishment for them could be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is noteworthy that many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in many cases, despite the violence, even associate positive memories with him".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protective officers at the Regensburg Cathedral" gives a contradictory picture of Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became a handyman when a dom sparrow did not bring top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from cover to cover, you'd rather wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is even in it.
It is only eight pages long and it is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool was also outside its sphere of influence.
He may be accused of not knowing it too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatz Gymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven", and "a better world".
Thus the vast majority of Georg Ratzinger's students give him a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "loved", "sincere", "competent", and "understanding", as an extremely kind-hearted teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, cookies, and candies and who was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has led to outbursts of anger.
That he not only smashed chairs and threw the key chain on the floor, but also slapped and pulled the hair or ears of too-proud boys, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretting it and apologizing.
However, it must be said in his honour that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know any other methods of punishment?
Of course, I think any of us born before 1968.
I too experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
I am sure that the Commission will be able to give us a clearer picture of the situation in the Member States.
One wonders if it's not more about his fame and his role as brother to Benedict XVI that many media are rushing to him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian pope are still eager to work on him.
The truth is that the report absolves Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
The report has been widely reported in the media on the subject of abuse of the Regensburg House sparrows.
Does the final report also accuse Georg Ratzinger of any involvement or knowledge of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly not.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the choirmaster.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it", said one sufferer, speaking for the others, "because I was very embarrassed about it".
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not confide in their parents and siblings, they certainly did not confide in a choirmaster who was, in a sense, a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One student interviewed put it this way: "In the case of sexual abuse ... I don't see ... any case where he (Georg Ratzinger) alone had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it's... also really absurd to assume that it's him... that boys have been more intrusive or clearer or even more open than their parents, their boarding school teachers, their trust teachers, etc.
"That you talk to him about sex is unthinkable".
The report concludes that "it was not possible to confirm that the affected pupils and/or their environment had confided in him beforehand".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be exonerated of all knowledge.
So he cannot be accused of not preventing or reporting it.
So there is no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
The media have been reading a lot about "violent taxation" among the Domspatzen of Regensburg.
The former cathedral choirmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with that?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting, everything is mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely what the report is doing wrong.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets.
The report also covers incidents from 1945 onwards, including four decades during which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspats.
The whole terrible school-beating, the cases of boys being harassed and mistreated by sadistic teachers and suffering horribly, all took place in the kindergartens in Etterhausen and Pielenhofen, where conditions must have been truly scandalous.
But the choirmaster of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, had nothing to do with them, for he did not see the boys until they were in the cathedral's grammar school.
Most witnesses point out that the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
They were just happy to have escaped it and enjoyed so much better treatment and, for many, even "paradise" conditions.
What was different about the Domspatz Gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This is also true of Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite the violence, even associate positive memories with him".
At most, the blame remains for having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods during which it was informed of conditions in the preschool.
The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and refused to hear about the proceedings at a school where he was not acting and responsible (so the witness said), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently turn a deaf ear to the situation?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the headmaster of the Dompatz Gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it he warns him that "the practice of flogging is still practiced in preschool".
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when flogging had long been prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal gray area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to determine where the parties concerned might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked the other way.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the punishment of school flogging was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism", the danger of judging the past by today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has always been abhorrent, nor to the atrocities and violence committed in preschools against innocent children, which is far beyond what was usual at the time.
This is all very awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His methods of discipline and punishment, such as slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was outlawed, he strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg days did Georg Ratzinger give in his talks with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of flogging mentioned?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, where the bishops played only a secondary role.
But I'm not hiding the fact that he was in charge of a strict regiment.
But it must also be said that without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to turn the then nationally renowned Regensburg Cathedral into an institution of world-class importance, a true cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, which toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candy alone, you can't make a bad boy into a great singer. And you can't beat success in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-improvement.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the talks on your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and I saw him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply religious and kind-hearted person, one who you can't imagine could do anything to a fly.
I regularly hear how many former parishioners still have regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family, 23 years after he retired.
So those who still don't forgive him for being so hard on them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the dummies are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course - but also a lovable and respected person whom they still look up to and worship.
And, again, I want to be clear: all the accusations against him are the methods of parenting that were the norm at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since passed this time.
But it's extremely unfair to make a man, just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him of his duties.
Now decency would order a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, finally leave in peace.
