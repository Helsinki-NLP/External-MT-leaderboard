Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and the district
One of those hanged had previously attempted suicide.
On October 30, at around 1 a.m., a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging in the village of Lugovoye, where he lived.
He is known to have attempted suicide in the past.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11: 50 a.m., a 41-year-old man from Kineshma committed suicide by hanging at his home.
No signs of violent death have been found, the press service of the Ministry of the Interior "Kineshemsky" reports.
Do you have a black box in your car?
As American road planners struggle to find the money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly mounted on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist travels and transmit that information to officials, are at the center of a controversial effort by Washington and state planners to modernize America's outdated highway financing system.
The usually boring arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to be allowed to use small boxes to track how many miles you drive - and perhaps even where you drive - and then use that information to compile tax bills.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot yet agree on whether to proceed, several states are not going to wait.
They are pondering how to move over the next decade to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
"This is not an issue where we can have a choice," said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Governors Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds for the Government's Highway Fund, which is financed by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax even by one cent when gasoline prices are high.
"The gasoline tax simply cannot be maintained," said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test the tomato payment system.
"It will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
Boredom calls it a tomato user board.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban liberals, because taxes could change travel patterns to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners are eyeing the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (Republican of Pennsylvania), chairman of the House transportation committee, said he, too, viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market advocates at Reason are also enthusiastic about making drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Reason's vice president of policy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also being supported by two former US transportation secretaries, who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward an exemplary toll.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
But House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers, who represent voters who often have to travel miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The most enthusiastic is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are being recruited to take part in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for mileage miles in lieu of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is being considered.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis involving trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can implement these changes.
This concept is not universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently fitted with the devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the tests were underway, the Nevada chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its Web site, "It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states struggling to find a low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of miles driven, but without information about where and when.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not involved in facilitating the collection of state taxes.
It has sought to enter the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it is testing attract road planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more likely to do this if you don't track their speed and location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with providing drivers with a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they could abandon the device altogether, choosing instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Elsewhere, the hope is to sell the idea to a wary public by forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that will also accept payment for parking meters, provide "pay as you go" insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be attracted to the benefits they will be offered," the planning document says.
Some transportation planners, however, are wondering whether all the talk of tomato pay is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much gasoline, to ensure that they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are underway with the IMF for a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that the aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
Moreover, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive €610 million from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences over financing conditions.
Nor does the international rating agency S & P, which on Friday downgraded Ukraine's sovereign rating by one notch to "B-" from "B."
But EU officials say the IMF can show flexibility in lending conditions, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a back-up option for supplying Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or a reversal from Slovakia.
The latter, officials say, is the most feasible and acceptable way if Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversing supplies to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and is likely to reduce supplies to other regions.
"Negotiations are underway between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from sources other than Russia, or from the same source, but on different routes," the source added to Reuters.
Russia out of the Fight for Car Pollution in Cities
Attempts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been taking place in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
Typically, this has involved either upgrading and widening highways, or trying to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars, and the time it takes to use them.
A well-known example is Singapore, where a strict quota has been imposed on the growth of private cars and the right to buy them is being auctioned.
Its price can be two or three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart are introducing so-called green zones, where only cars with a certain economy class that also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed in.
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 at a cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As Li Kunsheng, Director of Transport Pollution Control at the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, told Kommersant, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (currently 5.2 million), and increase fuel use per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are restrictions on the use of motor vehicles, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's Green Five-Year Plan measures include accelerating the adoption of Euro fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, introducing local eco-standards and labelling of cars and fuels, restricting the entry of cars into the city centre, banning the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, establishing incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrids or electric vehicles), developing electric transport (including public and service transport), and developing public transport (including high-speed transport).
Beijing's automobile innovations also include banning all private cars from driving within the fifth ring (there are six in total in the Chinese capital) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle's license plate), and issuing registration plates to cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of private vehicle registration permits in Beijing was only one-third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (compared to 138 in 2012).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, in 2011, "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all urban air pollution emissions.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from automobiles are ten times higher than those from industrial vehicles, and in St. Petersburg - nine times higher.
In the Russian Federation, they are only beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Policy at HSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are inherently unpopular, and can be adopted by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters of vehicles that are insufficiently sensitive to any regulatory impact - official and private cars, as well as those of "privileged" users, whose total number is no less than 200,000 (about 5% of Moscow's total fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study analyzing the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area, and the number of motor vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers are that the city center is provided with half as many roads as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods in parking lots or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build car depots rather than parking lots, to shorten rather than expand the carriageway (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), and to restrict the use and placement of private vehicles within the boundaries of the historic centre's protected area (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central districts of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street vending in Vologda will grow at times
According to city authorities, increasing the size of fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets of makeshift tents and stalls.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often do not pass proper sanitary checks.
This means that the health of Vologda residents is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase six-fold from November - from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, the press service of the Administration of Vologda reports.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russia's economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
First of all, there is the crisis of defaults on unsecured consumer loans and massive layoffs of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which hardly slows down, "stated Clemens Graf, Goldman Sachs" chief economist for Russia, presenting the Investment Bank's quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
Currently, nominal wage growth in Russia is around 10%.
With inflation at 6%, it will be able to support future consumer demand at roughly the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize their personnel costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP - by only 2%, Mr. Graf explained.
Companies have seen their profitability shrink.
Failure to grow could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment.
Russian business cannot keep raising wages, comments Vladimir Pantyushin, Chief Economist for Russia and the CIS at Barclays Capital.
Unemployment is near historic lows, and competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise wages in order to lure employees from outside or retain existing ones.
Consumption in Russia has also been supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit.
According to Mr. Graf, because of extremely high consumer borrowing rates, this type of lending has no multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"We have not seen any benefits to the economy from the growth of consumer credit, money does not disperse across the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is different: Goldman Sachs expects delinquencies on unsecured loans to rise.
They are taken mostly by the poor, who have nothing to provide as collateral.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are more often not returned, "Mr Graf said.
So the second threat to growth in Russia is a possible default crisis on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, Director of the HSE Banking Institute, already sees signs of a brewing banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, without access to the cheap resources that state-owned banks have, were forced to attract funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, state-owned banks went to war and began to cut credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state-owned banks do not abandon dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The revocation of the licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks is seen by the economist as a harbinger of a massive collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warns the head of the Institute.
But consumption growth will slow even without a default crisis, the investment bank believes, because of the refusal to indexate the salaries of civil servants and the military, which is included in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the blow to consumption will be cushioned by a natural monopoly tariff freeze (and, as a result, lower inflation).
But only partly: if investment does not grow (and the prerequisites for this are not yet in place - see note), consumption growth will still slow, Goldman Sachs believes.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see any prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil," he says.
According to him, Russia's economy will begin to contract with the price of oil below $90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet in a position to cut interest rates in the economy.
Paradoxically, inflation has fallen and banks are raising rates.
This may mean that they did not trust the central bank to announce the move to inflation targeting, "Clemens Graf said.
The central bank's interest rate policy has no effect on market rates, but only on interbank lending rates.
"For the CBA, this is the collapse of all hope," Clemens Graf said.
Banks use the money received at CBA auctions not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate is reduced, the exchange rate changes, which means that funds are trying to speculate against the rouble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy is not working," Mr. Graf said, and reminded that the state plans to let the rouble float "freely" by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do so sooner or raise the central bank's key rate (5.5%), he said.
According to him, the ruble exchange rate is now artificially overvalued by 10%.
The only way I can devalue is to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the central bank casts even a shadow of doubt in financiers that the elimination of the exchange-rate band is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it could bring the ruble down much more.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of the South Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
Here, we can set an example not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding, "affirms Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation, were discussed.
Following the results of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued at the Opera and Ballet Theatre.
An exhibition of national cultural associations of Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, has said he is prepared to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Streebele met Mr Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalise political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him.
Charges filed by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have become strained following allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who chairs the parliamentary group that oversees the intelligence service, said that if it is possible to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without endangering him or damaging relations with the US completely," it should be used.
Mr Streebele, a Green Party member of parliament in Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Streebele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of harassment that forced him to leave his home.
But he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to "his political utterances."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including in the United States - have found it useful for the public to expose an unchecked system of pervasive surveillance.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying carry-on luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep their entire can.
The new carry-on bag charge applies to bags in the upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay only once they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should force passengers to pay in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines began charging fees for first and second bags in baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees pile as much as they can into hand luggage placed in the upper baggage compartments, which often means that there is not enough space in these compartments.
Charges are one way to force passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said the new levy is not really for the sake of making money.
The fact is that Frontier's most loyal customers say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper baggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures at Frontier's website and check-in desks is intended to ensure that passengers are aware of the charge before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on bag charge will not begin until the summer, though a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after years of losses.
Most, however, did not apply to carry-on baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced its first carry-on fee three years ago, and another discounter, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year for Spirit.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and was wondering what he would find at the gate when passengers faced Spirit's unusual carry-on fee.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've seen in my airline career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went quickly."
Frontier also follows Spirit in charging $2 for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive a soda or juice can keep the entire can and that coffee refilling will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's carry-on fee initiative, where passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest effort to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than using an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone further than most in this area.
In September, it began offering half as many frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the trip miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would yield 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose their seats in advance only if they purchase tickets directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flying capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to mend Frontier's finances through the sale of the airline.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers, for website shutdown
The secretive National Security Agency said Friday night that the shutdown of their website for several hours caused a technical glitch, not hackers, as the network claimed.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a routine upgrade," the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack are untrue.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network was "not at all" hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online activist hacking group has claimed responsibility for bringing down the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target site with traffic until the servers become overloaded and the site crashes.
Hackers "tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The once-top-secret NSA, once dubbed the "No Agency," has come under intense public scrutiny and criticism in recent months following a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and at home - all in response to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by a frustrated former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to speculation that today's incident was the result of deliberate hacking.
Bombardier profits fall as shipments and plane orders fall
Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday as a result of lower aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any data on flight tests of its newest CSeries aircraft, nor has it provided any new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial service by next September will be met.
Since the first flight of the prototype aircraft about a month and a half ago, it has flown only three more times, raising questions about whether the testing phase is on schedule.
The results fell short of forecasts and sent shares down more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his estimate on Thursday from "above market average" to "market average" because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft shipments was largely predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the performance of the transportation division," Doerksen said in a stock market update.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, there are not too many firm orders for the CSeries yet - 177 - as potential buyers await the results of flight tests to verify the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.
In total, there are 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief executive Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial service.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and the media that the program was moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the plane's downtime.
All manufacturers plan trials differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, with the rest soon to follow, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer will be able to put the CSeries into service 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the commissioning date and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - while apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - supports our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were flat at 9 cents.
Gross revenue fell slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
Total orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace division's order book was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the overall market conditions were a nuisance," Beaudoin said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transportation division totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31.
The revenue of the transport division was negatively affected by problems with the execution of several major contracts.
Management has said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profit
Sony, the Japanese electronics maker, ended the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, and cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 turned out to be more disappointing than expected, owing to falling demand for televisions, camcorders, and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which posted its first operating profit in three years of ¥5.2 billion in the second quarter, fell back to ¥9.3 billion in the reporting period.
Japan's consumer electronics market is going through tough times, especially because of declining demand for televisions.
And while competitors are looking for a way out, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where the company's sales are growing rapidly, especially at the expense of automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, Sony expects operating profit of ¥179 billion by the end of the fiscal year ending in March 2014, up from ¥230 billion previously expected.
Analysts had expected the figure to be significantly higher at 221 billion yen, according to Thomson Reuters data.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the launch of sales of a "smart" watch from a Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will eliminate the need to pull out a smartphone from your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% to 1,668 yen per share in the morning trading session in Tokyo.
Speech gene found to stimulate synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that makes the Foxp2 "speech gene" function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and a summary can be read on the journal's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene was disrupted in family members, but how it performs its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that Foxp2 performs at least some of its functions as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in an area of the brain associated with speech formation.
It does so thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by searching for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 alone responsible for its activity.
Scientists confirmed that SRPX2 does affect vocalization in an experiment on mice.
When the animals' gene activity was artificially reduced, they cried less when separated from their mother.
If gene activity was restored, so was the frequency of sounds.
Previously, mice were also shown to be associated with Foxp2 "s own vocalization.
Animals given a human copy of the gene ate more intensively and at a lower rate than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2, and thus the SRPX2 it controls, is related to purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or to more subtle processes.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned gang leader of police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to crime boss Neil Scarborough
Lawyer feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared revealing his secret drug addiction has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave criminal boss Neil Scarborough classified information about an investigation into his drug-trafficking activities after he was put at risk by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and dubbed a "cool lawyer" among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police raid on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug trial.
Officers spotted the 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three bags of cocaine outside the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a Bar Association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta had been a "regular user" of the class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
For eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine trafficking ring in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be uncovered.
Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, was pilloried at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of wilful obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted possession of cocaine at an earlier court hearing.
The lawyer's revelation came after police investigating Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect down and found him walking up to Ditt's home in Blackburn and putting 60 per cent pure drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's dustbin.
Soon after the transfer, Scarborough made repeated phone calls to Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers "Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home to pick up the drugs; there were nine conversations between the two.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a "lawyer's secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated and a sample of his hair was also taken.
When questioned by police, he said that in addition to his job, he had a home office and clients came to his house for legal reasons.
However, the court heard that after the important arrests he made calls to major drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
In a damning speech, Anne White said: "If anyone knows that the law should not be broken, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer by becoming too close to certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations will no doubt turn out to be legitimate because he was their lawyer.
But this has largely transcended the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He became too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed doubts about his disinterest to creep in.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass the information on to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Detective Chief Superintendent Lee Halstead, of Lancashire Police, said: "Mr Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to being a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organised crime."
His cocaine addiction left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main gang members who entrusted him with gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and instil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
Mr Ditt was investigated by Lancashire's Serious Organised Crime Unit, which has already convicted him of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring that criminals are fairly punished.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the scheme were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta has organized a question-and-answer session in which he says his dream job is as a lawyer representing clients facing the death penalty in America, his ideal dinner companion is Muhammad Ali, and his motivation for work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, police officers who attended today's meeting of the FTC RFS noted.
The ticket program is, in their opinion, about twice as high.
During the match of the 1 / 16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartak, only one thousand stewards were involved, compared to the regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartacus fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but, according to an agreement with the Moscow club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
The data was released by the head of the FCC, Arthur Grigoryants.
Americans eavesdropped on Japanese officials
On Friday, November 1, an American intelligence official, who preferred not to be named, said that the United States had tapped the telephone conversations of senior Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that there are several listening points in the land of the rising sun.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during World War II, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the postwar period, are targets for intelligence activities, reported NHK.
Officially, neither side has yet commented on this information.
Recall that news about the surveillance of the German Chancellor by US intelligence agencies appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have tapped Merkel's phone for the past decade.
The Chancellor herself is said to have taken the news of her wiretap very seriously.
She said that such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable for allies that she believes have been Germany and the United States for decades.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden has said that he is ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel with German prosecutors.
The German had flown specially to Moscow to meet the former CIA officer.
Bashkir may put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkortostan can put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014 during state procurement interventions, the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko, believes.
Today, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and there is demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister reminded that this year, crops sown for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were planted for the 2014 harvest (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and rye has remained at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Fraternal circle," to which the United States identified Leps
The group "Fraternal Circle," to which Washington has listed the singer Grigory Leps, is not listed in the databases of Russian security forces.
As noted to Interfax by law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports appeared in the media about the inclusion of the US Treasury Department of Gregory Leps in control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "Fraternal Circle," all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
Distribution of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia," which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the title itself - 'Fraternal circle', there is an element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to a PR action," said the agency's interlocutor.
On October 31, the US Department of the Treasury announced that Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky, and Igor Shlykov had been added to its watch lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate Fraternal Circle.
Individuals on the list are suspected of having ties to certain Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "nonsense."
In 2011, US President Barack Obama designated the Fraternal Circle syndicate as a "significant transnational organized crime group" and instructed the Treasury Department to "disrupt and disrupt their global criminal operations."
The blacklisting of a person by the US Treasury entails the freezing of his assets in the US and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the States.
Scandal video hits police
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack cocaine.
Police in the Canadian city said they have the relevant video and are ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he vouched for its existence.
Blair said the compromising video of Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-drug raid by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
Earlier, the Canadian press reported on the existence of this video, but until recently, there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on this matter.
He just says he is innocent and has no intention of resigning.
The video discovered by police is one piece of evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of selling light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal profits, and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisi served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared drunk in public, and made racist and sexist remarks.
JSC "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract at Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and according to the terms of the tender, the draft should be prepared and sent for state expertise in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of airport complex improvement.
At the first stage of construction, the terminal's internal area will amount to 50 thousand square meters, and in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the results of the tender were summed up, the architectural concept of Yuzhniy Airport Complex, developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The design of the main terminal embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in implementing major projects; the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new terminal complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
Yuzhniy International Airport Complex will be built in Aksaysky District of Rostov Region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and eventually integrated into urban development.
Construction of the airport complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, with all facilities commissioned in 2017.
Politician in Turkey goes on hunger strike against Syria border wall
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of a separation wall near the southeastern Turkish city of Nusaybin.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaybin, located on the border with Syria, Ayse Gekhan, went on hunger strike to protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) told RIA Novosti on Friday.
Police have repeatedly cracked down on protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Güler first denied the construction, then said that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybin, Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, went on hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds having crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never accept," Ayshe Gekhan of the party is quoted as saying.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg agency on November 1, with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolívar vis-à-vis the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars to the dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is valued at 57 bolívares.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 per cent of its value.
In September, Venezuela's inflation rate was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramírez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information cited by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after municipal elections in December.
Policies of price containment for foodstuffs and consumer goods, as well as a high degree of over-regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to shortages of a number of commodities and the functioning of a black foreign exchange market.
This spring, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of "Ugra" Andrei Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation occurred only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach, - ITAR-TASS quotes Belmacha as saying.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
We want not just to find a coach, but someone who will work in our club for a few years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for asking: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
"The law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and a news website.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law will effectively allow the government to "take the media by the scruff of the neck," while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "have been dealt a serious blow" and criticised the bill as "draconian."
The bill's passage is part of measures taken to strengthen national security in the wake of the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have angered authorities by broadcasting CCTV footage of troops sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo's response was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to Kshs 20 million and individual journalists up to Kshs 1 million, with the additional risk of being "de-listed," that is, barred from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations."
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "vibrant blogosphere."
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"Left to their own devices, politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge tax-free monthly wage of around 532,000 shillings - one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenses will appear in the utility bills of the residents of Voronezh - deductions for major repairs to the house.
According to the most approximate calculations, starting from the new year, a standard two-bedroom apartment will have to pay an extra 100 to 400 roubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the region's government.
On the other hand, when to paint the entrance, tidy up the stairwells or even replace the elevator, it will be up to the residents to decide.
Such a law was approved by deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to put order in order - to set priorities for the overhaul of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register here and there in Moscow, in Orenburg, or elsewhere, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state, equity construction is now also under way.
The law protecting against fraudsters was approved by the oblast duma in final reading.
The document was not born from scratch.
In our region, 4,500 people suffered from dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in equity construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses have also begun in this area, owing to the fact that in 98 the same shareholders got into it, and in 2000 the same shareholders got into it."
People began to make money from it to close the loophole, including by passing these two laws.
Near Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under pressure from the federation.
Problems related to illegal migrants in the region are at least mitigated.
So, last year, a little more than 100 thousand foreigners turned up for migration registration.
But only one in five has an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no ship, and they must be deported - they must be kept somewhere.
Such a decision was made by the federation, which decided to equip such places at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place has been identified - the Old Olshanka of the Semiluksky District.
Finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are fully exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but so do parents with many children.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt 3 or more children will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, consists of 6 people - father, mother, native child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand roubles.
For the left bank or the Southwest neighborhood, this is an acceptable option.
Well, and in the district center you can buy an entire cottage for this amount.
Baumgertner Nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkali
The current Board of Directors of OAO Uralkali has proposed the candidacy of CEO Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk, for the new Board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner is among 11 people nominated to the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, which will determine the new composition of the Board of Directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
Later, however, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated at a press conference that Baumgertner's charges had been reclassified as "embezzlement."
Goalkeeper of "Petrochemist" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of Nizhnekamsk residents.
The goalkeeper believes that interim head coach Dmitry Balmin has great respect among the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall that today "Petrochemist" dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, "RIA Novosti quotes Dalton as saying.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will be able to cope with the responsibilities entrusted to him - I have no doubt about that.
He has great authority in the team, this young specialist definitely has a great future ahead of him.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming Italian league match against Parma.
Football Italia reports that the coaching staff decided not to include him in the bid for the game in order to protect him ahead of the Champions League fourth-round tie with Real Madrid.
Lichtsteiner, Vucinic and Pepe will also not take part in the match against Parma.
And forward Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from injury and is ready to play.
A tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax (MET) on oil, together with a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise duties, will lead to higher fuel prices.
According to experts, these measures may bring an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The chairman of the Krasnoyarsk Court had his identity stolen by hitting him on the head
Unknown assailants attacked the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk regional court, Vladimir Dvoekonko, stealing his identity card.
According to Interfax, late on Wednesday evening, the intruders hit the judge on the head, causing him to lose consciousness.
When the 63-year-old president of the court regained consciousness, he discovered that his business card had been taken out.
The criminals did not take money or other valuables.
Dvoiokonko reached the house on his own, and only contacted the police the next day.
The crime is being investigated and the culprits are being sought.
Zenit fans on the club's official website recognized the ex-captain of the Russian national team as the best player of the past month.

Second place at the end of the month went to goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin, who became the best player in August and September.
In third place is striker Hulk.
The Brazilian has two goals and three assists.
Recall that Arshavin returned to Zenit this summer.

US Secretary of State: Intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far" in collecting data
US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in the collection of data and wiretaps, American intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far," but the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not injured in this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and was inappropriate.
I recognize this, as does the president... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future, "the Secretary of State is quoted as saying by AFP.
Italy's seniority workers give way to the young
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country's residents are now unemployed.
Things have not been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, the figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15-24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is early retirement for older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the country's largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term employees.
But Italy, on the other hand, faces a common European challenge of an aging population.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation scheme will pay off.
What will the construction of TPU in Moscow lead to?
Every year, the capital's authorities promise to equip more and more transport and transfer hubs (TPUs).
By 2020, it is planned to commission 255 TPUs.
Our correspondent looked at what the project actually turns out to be.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the Smolenskaya metro station on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription read that the arrangement of the transport and transfer node was under way.
All of this was very strange, as no ground transport stops near Smolenskaya and, therefore, it is impossible to get on it.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sadovoye Ring, it is necessary to travel about 130 metres, including a land crossing through Karmanitsky Lane.
Now "Smolenskaya" is almost finished.
The flower stall has disappeared, the newspaper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by paving stones.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transfer nodes can be flat and capital, the press service of the capital's Department of Transport explains.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flat ones imply the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial objects that interfere with passenger traffic, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
In fact, the flat TPUs are not even carried out by transport workers, but by professional landscapers from the Moscow City Department of Capital Repair.
A transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over one's head and a sign announcing the time of arrival of transport is enough.
For example, the Yasenevo metro station recently opened a fully-fledged flat transfer node.
Let's not have canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials write down in the TPU anything that gets there.
Back in 2011, the City Hall planned to build all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now there are as many as 255 TPUs in the plans until 2020.
One and a half of them are promised to be commissioned this year.
Although the city has a TPU development program, there are no qualitative criteria, says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the City and Transport NGO.
They report on the number of sites, but the quality of transplants at each site often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: first, reduction of the transfer time, and, second, convenience.
Above all, the ability to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, on the other hand, TPU development sometimes goes exactly the opposite way.
A vivid example of the VDNKh metro system.
Previously, commuter buses from Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russian Exhibition Center.
Now their stops have been moved to Kosmonavtov Street on the opposite side of Yaroslavka.
Further from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
It is a gift that the residents absolutely did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
Capital TPUs in Moscow were not immediately addressed.
The first of them began to be built about five years ago near the Planernaya metro station.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
Indeed, it is an example of how a transfer node left to investors turns into a banal shopping mall.
No, there are aprons for buses, a canopy to avoid walking from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow's TPU were denied a place on principle.
Like strangers, they were pushed away from the subway.
But there is more room for trade.
Clothing alone has 32 stores, and there is almost everything - from pet goods to car showrooms.
In fact, all of a sudden, who will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason we always end up with a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the car park was decided to put on the market.
Now, on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya," among the parking spaces marked on the floor, there is a fierce trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, a non-Russian speech and security guards staring angrily at our photographer.
The transfer hub has finally become a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier, Planernaya metro station had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, traders were pitied and allowed into the intercepting parking of the transfer node.
Still, because of high prices, it is always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place... a new flat TPU.
That's the way it is.
At the Kaluzhskaya metro station, the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, ostensibly the TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping centre.
After 10 p.m., when it is closed, you have to walk around it in the open air.
However, the structures at Planernaya and Kaluga will soon look like flowers.
In mid-September, the town planning and land commission of the City Hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25 storeys, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow up at the metro station "Tushino," it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Station of Russian Railways, who are responsible for the construction of the TPU near the subway, have already told journalists that the future multi-storey buildings will house shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials say that multi-level parking lots will occupy between one-third and one-half of the area.
Consider the "people's" garages.
For example, a 258-car garage recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square meters.
This means that Petrovsko-Razumovskaya will need about 80,000 square meters to park its 2,600 cars.
This is less than a third of the maquis that are going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all kinds of bus platforms.
At least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate remain.
And that, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPUs at stations and stations are being built by railway workers, the rest of the sites will be developed by metro workers.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow Property Department recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, according to which investors will be able to apply directly to officials for a site for TPU.
Without any competition.
Because, they say, transport issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadaina station in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without going outside.
There's no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are being pushed to the extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will plow 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser suggests equating an insult to patriotism with extremism
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Just Russia proposes to equate the insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent for an opinion to the Supreme Court and the government.
By patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional bond of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude to its fate, and respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, there are sanctions in domestic legislation for abuse of the formal signs of state power - the flag and the emblem.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt and offended by state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions that take place every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the struggle against fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a veritable bacchanalia takes place every year.
Exercising wit and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists go so far as to say that it is a pity that cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation, "Oleg Mikheev resents.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than religious people, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings with almost impunity.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to equate insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activity and prescribe a corresponding penalty in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a fine of 100 thousand to 5 years in prison.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reports.
The quake was centered in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the USGS said on its website.
The tremors were recorded at 8: 03 p.m. local time (3: 03 a.m. on November 1, Moscow time).
No casualties or damage caused by the tremors have yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of various magnitude there are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Back then, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami killed more than 550 people and destroyed 220,000 buildings in Chile.
Chile also experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history, with a magnitude of 9.5 recorded in 1960.
More than five thousand people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be heard fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can rest assured that the trial will be conducted in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like other activists, faces hooliganism charges.
"I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detained citizen," RIA Novosti quotes Mr Ero as saying.
"Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to break the law," Dmitry Medvedev said in turn.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy resources, are dangerous.
He stressed that these facilities are "like a powder keg," and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
UN Announces New Poverty Targets
The United Nations should immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for a "sustainable development goal" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro the previous evening.
They were included in the final version of the document that world leaders, including Ms Gillard, will sign during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit last night that now is the time to "rise above the national interest."
"I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to use the authority entrusted to me by member countries to realize our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security worries grow in Mozambique as powerful men clash
Beneath a peering down statue of Zamora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, thousands gathered in central Maputo to chant slogans of peace in one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she swapped her business suit for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "We Demand Security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst since the truce was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a prominent rebel movement, backed first by the white Rhodesian authorities and then by the apartheid-era South African government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy, and Anadarko of the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo's party says the government instigated the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, Renamo's traditional stronghold, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for instigating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Guebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever is left of his power to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
But fears grew after it was reported that Mazanga had announced Renamo's repudiation of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Frelimo's non-compliance with the agreement.
"Our goal is to get back to the talks, but in all seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been heightened by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential people (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who have clashed head on," said Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo's party, which is seeking electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to win concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to do better in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who is due to step down next year when his second term ends, wanted to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but she has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes Beira, the port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended rail use for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo's party wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has exacerbated discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development, and the recent increase in kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and should find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstrator, said people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he said.
A series of Art Mainstream film premieres will take place in Moscow
A series of art-mainstream film screenings, where audiences will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the Roland cinema from November 1 to 5, reports RIA Novosti, with reference to the organizers of the project.
The French comedy by director and actress Reem Kerichi, "Paris at Any Cost," will open the Art Mainstream program.
This is the story of Maya (Kerichi herself), a model working in the French capital who is deported to her home country of Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also be shown a new film by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk, "Moebius," Oliver Hirschbiegel's melodramatic biopic "Diana: A Love Story" (Diana) starring Naomi Watts, and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival held in May, "The Life of Adele," by Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian participant in the "Art-mainstream" will be Aleksandr Veledinsky's film "The Globe Drink," based on Alexei Ivanov's novel of the same name, which won the Kinotavr festival.
Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the Kinotavra prize, played the main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Srusskin.
Children should learn myths and legends as "lifestyle models," the author says.
Tales of the Torah could show that "brute force cannot defeat sophisticated subterfuge," and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will prove to be "too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools," Crossley-Holland advocates "careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have advocated putting them on the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the "excessive moralizing" of authors and teachers "discourages interest" in children, and core ideas are "sublimated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language and also wrote The Norwegian Myth Compendium for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have intentions, of course, but you'd better keep them with you."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it should be sublimated; revealed through history, not articulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
A football fan who broke a window in the station's waiting room has been detained in the Voronezh region
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29, at the station of Gryazi-Voronezh, transport police officers removed two football fans - natives of the Moscow region - from a passenger train.
Having gone to the game of their favorite team, the guys had a drunken fight on the train on the way.
The young people were taken to the duty section of the linear police station at Gryazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offence.
There, fans expressed remorse for their anti-social behaviour.
The police processed the administrative material on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and waited at the station for its arrival.
At half past midnight, the fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old man, suddenly returned and kicked the front door window in the station's waiting room.
An employee of the transport police and a guard of the private joint-stock company, Russian Railways, rushed to the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend an intruder who was trying to flee the scene.
Officers of the Southeast LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are conducting an audit.
A criminal case is being considered, said Sergei Olkhovik, Senior Information and Public Relations Officer for the Southeast LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
I think we're about 15 years back.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the disturbances in the stands during the Shinnik-Spartak match of the Russian Cup.
I advocate that the organizers of sports events - clubs, leagues, RFU - should be responsible for all this.
But we can see that they have taken a different stance.
They are waiting for someone from outside to come in and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not quite the right one.
Fans need to be organised, clubs need to invite their stewards, not let things slide.
We have now drafted a special government decree on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
Once adopted, we will address this issue head on.
But I will certainly invite all the organizers of the football process to visit me.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state, they say, let the law take its course.
It feels like it was the Bayern fans who came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
And we are bystanders.
In general, it is terrible to see the podium being watered from the fireplace.
And that is in a country preparing for the World Cup.
"I have a feeling that we are 10-15 years back," Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden will likely not travel outside of Russia to testify in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's wiretapping cases.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from representatives of the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually ruled out.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by countries that are allies of the United States," the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or hand over written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, a member of the German Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebele, said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the American intelligence services' wiretapping of the German Chancellor's talks.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CIA official has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the US NSA has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival, "Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on Interfax's statement, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide for himself.
Edward Snowden, a US citizen who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he made public information about secret US intelligence surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden was flying through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was revoked by the US authorities, who in absentia charged him with serious crimes, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo the same day.
Yesterday, the American's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, said his client had found a job with a "large Russian company."
German media reported on the NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, Americans began tapping the Chancellor's phone calls as early as 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the US embassy in Berlin.
German authorities, after the publication of the information, said that surveillance of Merkel violates German law and sovereignty.
Ponomarev leaves Just Russia
Deputy of the State Duma from the Just Russia party, a member of its Novosibirsk branch, Ilya Ponomarev, has applied to leave the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted an application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its statutes, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of "righteousness."
We sit there drinking tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the painting" Ilya Ponomarev puts his party card on the table, "but there is nothing so epochal about it," commented the deputy on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev is not going to give up his mandate as a State Duma deputy.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not leave it by law.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave Just Russia emerged on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave SR with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan to discuss peace treaty with Russia
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue and discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kishida said at the meeting.
Japan's foreign minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the two countries became warmer and more bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in resolving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies resolving the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today to demand the return of the country's lost land after World War II.
Cars drive through the Japanese capital, from which a loudspeaker can be heard saying: "Return the northern territories!."
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It's safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
Fay's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started in the Carolines and then became more successful, got to the point where they were already too famous to perform at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue to work with them.
This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Mara, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual musical-comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others, will appear.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in unconventional ways, for example, through shows on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame for his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (the FXX fantasy-football-themed FXX League), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for a series of viral videos, "Marseille is a Shell in Boots."
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (the surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the cunning, race-focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but went on to become a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in Midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely the centerpiece of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down a street between two houses and thinks, "If I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities open talks with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the country's embassy in the UK, where Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
Pakistan's prime minister made the announcement about talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market, and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that a dialogue with the Taliban has begun," a statement from Pakistan's embassy in London said.
"He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allied with the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwest of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban seek to establish an Islamic state.
Earlier, the Islamabad government tried to open talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities withdrew troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were operating and released arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrives in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as worries about large inventories overshadowed a report showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
Benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel late in the morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell 39 cents, adding up to a 5.8 percent decline for October.
Rich oil inventories have weighed on its price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. inventories increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, stocks have been replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But there was a hint of a possible uptick in demand on Friday, with two reports on Chinese manufacturing showing a surge in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery may continue to gain strength, after the third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent from a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, the international benchmark used by US refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Head coach of "Colorado" Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday's match with "Dallas," expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas, CBS News correspondent Natalia Shmeleva.
What can we expect, "Rua said after the morning sweep of the Avalanche.
Of course, we are all concerned about what happened, but we are confident in him and feel it would be good for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you are absolutely sure that the situation did not affect the goalkeeper's standards in any way?
We will see today.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him guard the goal, as they have in previous matches this season.
Most importantly, no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until this situation is dealt with by the court.
Don't be a vegan in Siberia: Greenhouse tomato won't replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who have completely given up animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they will not be able to endure winter without health losses, and no amount of greenhouse tomatoes will compensate them, Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of the Day of Vegans believe.
Drink oil in litres
Strict vegetarianism, in which not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, are rejected, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, adhering to such strict dietary standards is, at the very least, unhelpful for health.
Abandoning animal products altogether is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant proteins.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet, "says nutritionist Marina Bogai.
She cites fish that contain the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
Its richest vegetable oil is flaxseed oil.
"You have to drink litres to consume it in the quantities that a person needs!" says the dietician.
Doctors believe that Siberians should pay special attention to their diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is especially in question this season.
In our reality, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased caloric intake.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, accordingly, he does not get this caloric intake," says the specialist.
Olga Poznyak, a nutritionist, agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
A person is better off eating mostly foods that are grown in his or her region of residence or where he or she was born.
The genetic code is set to improve the absorption and digestion of these foods.
And in winter, people don't want to nibble on a cucumber, but on a hot soup or something else, "the doctor explains his position.
According to her, of what vegans can eat, various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples that remain in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is clearly not enough for a proper diet.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have sufficient levels of vitamins in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, where temperatures can change by 30 degrees overnight and snow falls in May, is not advisable.
The body needs energy to live, and this is, first and foremost, fat, "the medic states.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up and need building materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them inferior ones.
Pregnant women also need higher levels of protein, vitamins, and micronutrients on their menus.
"Vegans don't get it," Bogay said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play whatever toys he wants."
He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs.
And children still need to eat well.
If parents deprive him of micronutrients or amino acids by choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"Lack of certain substances for brain development, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree on the poor quality of the vegetables and fruits grown in winter greenhouses and imported.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than (grown) in the open.
"The quality of the food is not what it is," Bogay says.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes, the desire of producers to produce more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples do not turn brown on the cut, the cucumbers quickly turn yellow and mold, the tomatoes are tasteless and unflavored," the medic gives examples, adding that they are likely filled with excess fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
Vera Petruk, Candidate of Agricultural Sciences at the Siberian Physics and Technology Institute of Agrarian Problems, disagrees.
She says that with the right approach and adherence to all norms and requirements, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables in greenhouses.
If they try to drive more from the square meter, they will, of course, water the plants more often and overfeed them with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow fast, they are large but watery and unsweet, "she explains, adding that the quality issue depends primarily on the producer.
Court Suspends Stop-and-Search at New York Police Department
On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and removed a judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that the execution of Judge Shira Scheindlin's rulings would be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it ran its street detention and interrogation program.
The city has filed an appeal against its decision and remedial orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard arguments on the motion to stay the case.
The appeals court said the judge should be recused because she violated the US code of conduct for judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.
A judge has ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by improperly approaching blacks and Latinos under a stop-and-search program.
It appointed an external monitor to oversee sweeping changes that include policy, training, and oversight reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test body cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dropped after a police review.
A hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-search tactics have been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Stop-and-search has been practiced in one form or another for decades, but the number of documented stops has skyrocketed under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time record of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class-action lawsuit.
Advocates of changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program say the changes will end unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service, and could affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will lower police morale rather than crime rates, waste money, and fail to address the broader problem of difficult policing conditions, owing to a decline in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of "stop-and-search," which is constitutional, but changes the way New York City police stop people.
A pedestrian zone has been opened near the Tretyakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to Bolotnaya Square.
Street signs, flower stands, benches, urns and toilets have been erected along the entire length, and deaf fences and illegal advertisements have been removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky Lane, which were already pedestrian lanes, five streets - Ordynsky cul-de-sac, Bolshoi and Maly Tolmachevsky Lane, Kadashevskaya Embankment and Bolotnaya Square - were closed to cars.
Traffic on Maroseika and Petrovka streets is not restricted.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya Street from the lobby of Novokuznetskaya station to Klimentovsky Lane, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing traffic and cutting the carriageway, newsmsk.com. reports.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of the Holy Martyr Clement the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other landmarks.
Previously, Tverskaya proezd, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Most Street were completely pedestrian.
Greater Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was closed to cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used phone hacking to check confidential messages
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to corroborate false information about a novel by Charles Clarke, then Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that in May 2005 the News of the World received false news that Clarke was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Polby's voicemail and kept her waiting outside the house to be interviewed, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
"The prosecution believes Mr Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a man who will stand outside someone's house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is a man who likes to offer a story to people to see what they say," Mr Edis said.
He said the News of the World used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally implicated in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the former?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh yes!"
Rumors of Clark's affair first caught the attention of the News of the World when a source with a sexual interest in Ms Polby was told: "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A cassette of voicemails received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found notes on a private detective's computer that listed Miss Polby and her sister as "Projects."
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr Edis said Mr Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck and Weatherap admitted phone hacking.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to German authorities about the wiretapping case
Former CIA employee Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele, through whom Snowden conveyed a message to the German authorities.
Strebele met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on Tverskaya Street
Four passers-by were injured as a result of a fire in a collector in the centre of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by who were in a smoke-filled underpass during the fire were injured.
As RIA Novosti writes with reference to Pavel Livinsky, the head of the capital's Department of Fuel and Energy Services, at present all houses on Tverskaya Street have fully restored electricity supply.
A fire in a heat collector near 15 Tverskaya Street occurred in the evening of October 31.
Heavy smoke came from the storm drainage hatches, and smoke formed in the underpass near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were emptied.
At 21: 45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
The US Cuts Food Allowance for the Poor
Meal allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Food stamps, known as "food stamps," are being slashed in the United States starting Friday as a government program expires.
Food stamps for a family of four will now cost $36 less a month than they did before, officials said.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, per capita benefits averaged $133 per month in fiscal year 2012.
Spending on food aid in the US has risen to $80 billion a year, owing to rising unemployment and rising food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid provided through "food stamps," which have been so-called since the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should target those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America worry that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
US congressmen continue to debate how to cut the government's funding further.
Blizzard releases 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platformer for free on the PC.
WoW Insider reports.
According to him, the game became available in Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is also not yet available.
According to media reports, the version Blizzard has now released on the PC looks no different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is Vlaros's son Kyle, who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
New machines will appear in the Moscow subway.
But they won't sell tickets to passengers for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of squats will be calculated using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Vystavochnaya station on November 8, 2013.
President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova will take part in the presentation of the new ticket machines.
National Security Agency confessions add to corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US Mission, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV had hoped to detect eavesdropping antennas, a move that triggered talks between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence "to steal foreign companies" trade secrets for the benefit of US companies in order to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. "
But since Edward Snowden - a contract employee turned whistleblower - began to publish his trove of US intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be taken at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have taken corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new heights.
The final straw came with the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If Europe's most influential person can be targeted, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has revealed intense cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is likely that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Gruen, president of BITMi, which represents Germany's small and medium-size IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost as much risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting firm EY.
All of the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, have so far contained no evidence that the US passed trade secrets to foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in information technology and the Internet, and have suggested that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," said Gasso Plattner, president of German business software provider SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to perish more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to automobiles to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
And yet the reach and technical sophistication of US spying agencies, made public by Snowden's revelations, has come as a shock to some companies that once thought that China posed the greatest surveillance risk.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European CEOs have become more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction, and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-American members abandoned plans to use the services of a US-based cloud provider following the exposure of the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snape, SAP's co-chief executive, said: "We are seeing consumers asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that data must therefore be protected at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
It has always been there.
"This has been the subject of discussion for years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," said Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, and we spy on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can give an advantage to the adversary.
Large companies have long learned that taking a free USB stick at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, to say the least, imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi's board of directors, says it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can't be used as listening devices.
Germany's Federal Constitutional Protection Service is recommending that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
Nevertheless, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, personnel, and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV report warns.
The US has warned its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Report in February ranked France, along with Russia and Israel, as the second-largest economic intelligence hacker behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a prestigious German company has confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Parents of Georgia teenager who died by 'bizarre accident' believe their son was killed
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat at his high school gym believe their son was killed, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a upright mat, leaning back against the stands at his high school gym.
Investigators with the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was killed," Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says he did.
"They think it defies logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it is a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the view that there is sufficient basis" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that an initial autopsy showed Johnson died of "positional asphyxia."
But a second autopsy, Moore said, revealed a different cause of death.
"There are several issues that need to be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to call for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct one.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance camera footage that investigators were reviewing.
The teenager's parents said they hope the videos hold the key to unraveling how he died.
Spartak: For information about individuals who displayed fascist symbols
A statement from the Moscow club about the appearance of a fascist flag on the stand in Yaroslavl appeared on the official website of Spartak.
"At the Shinnik-Spartak Cup match on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl displayed fascist symbols.
We appeal to anyone with reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it.
"Remuneration is guaranteed," the statement said.
Looking for fans who hung a fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match of the 1 / 16 finals of the Russian Cup, Shinnik - Spartak was interrupted several times because of disturbances in the stands.
Fascist symbols were also displayed on the Spartak fan area.
As a punishment, Spartak can play about three matches without spectators.
The committee will meet on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and posted this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of recommendations to control children's food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the US government at a time when the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
One in 20 children in the US now has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of adrenaline - most commonly injected with an automatic medical syringe, EpiPen - to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently changed regulations to allow schools to stock up on adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have developed an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "it feels like something pokes into my tongue," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue," or "my tongue is pinching."
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indeterminate"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate external genitalia.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be identified as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to identify any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as "uncertain" or "unknown" on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to relieve pressure on parents to make hasty decisions about sex-reassignment surgery for newborns, and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said years later: "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain a patchwork of bruises and scars created by doctors.
Roughly one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorders" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed external sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still understudied, but most experts in the US say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor a child's psychological and physical development before surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don't," he said.
You can assign gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a puzzle about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either sex, and is typical of both, or is not characteristic of either.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts, and physique; primary sexual traits, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the levels of harassment, abuse, and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Boys with gender biases now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify the male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be declared "asexual," defending in court the right to retain an "indefinite" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, a third symbol in addition to M and F-X, i.e. intersex, will be used in German passports.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a staunchly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being drawn into a new state, where gender is a matter of choice and sexual activity is not, we are upgrading two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the website Baby Zone that she would prefer children to have sex determined at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex organs were called hermaphrodites - after a beautiful Greek god who possessed traits of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community viewed gender as a leaf on which to erase and then paint again.
But many now question the ethical rationale for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choices without knowing how a child will perceive his or her assigned gender when he or she grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a" psychiatric emergency, "" Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist - you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to deal with children with intermediate genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social signals - how parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person identifies as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John / Joan," his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender reassignments declared themselves "dissatisfied with the outcome."
So was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but an intermediate genitalia.
Doctors could not pinpoint whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced he would never be able to live a "full life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitals and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But, depressed and aware that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genitals to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone injections and having his breasts removed.
The surgery left him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of people with intersexuality.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of Advocates for Informed Choice, a California-based legal association, is concerned that the German law "encourages labeling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give their child an" indefinite gender, "" she said.
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will play out, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender identity," she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
It is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arleen Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and is helping hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "support" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a sexual development disorder called "total insensitivity syndrome to androgens."
Because her androgenic receptors don't work properly, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and completing a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and sort out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In this case, you are fine - raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joyful.
We do not need to rush into surgery that is irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don't feel they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide with which gender he or she is more comfortable - and that is great.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
The goalkeeper of "Chicago" Nikolai Khabibulin emphasized that he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at trainings.
In the Hawks "last two meetings, Khabibulin first missed six goals against Tampa Bay and then four against Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after a fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't manage it, "Khabibulin quoted CSNChicago as saying.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably you should approach them as games, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on the weaknesses that were there.
There are a few little things I need to improve on, but in training I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few goals, everything turns into a snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a bit.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I'm that one - always try to have a perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so many pucks.
It's great that my team-mates support me, but in principle it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to do it a lot better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put that aside.
I'll just try to play my next match better.
A public bus has capsized in Altai.
In Rubtsovsky District, Altai Krai, a PAZ bus rolled over.
As a result of the accident, according to the updated data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies in the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vishnevka highway, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
The bus, travelling from Rubtsovsk to Wisniewka, had 12 passengers and the driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, and two people were hospitalized at Rubtsovsk Central Medical Center.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that, once established in Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe as well.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type," Interfax quotes Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, as it is a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is established in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will one day be delivered to France as well," the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passengers.
The power engineers of Dnepropetrovsk region have started a unique program to save stork nests...
In the old days, in order to bring storks to the yard, the villagers mounted a cart wheel on a high pole, and the heavy nest held on to it well.
Such special poles have not been installed for a long time, so storks have looked around the electricity poles - the intertwined branches are supported by wires, thanks to which the stork house stands securely.
Grandmother Anya, whose house in Ivanovka village, Petrikovsky district, has been home to a faithful family for twenty years, began to notice how the nest was settling down, despite the best efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer is already embedded between the wires, about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of storks, who each year nested at the yard, bred and fed three or four chicks during the summer, but there is no wish to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew away to the warm regions, Anya's grandmother called the Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
I didn't expect them to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovo, they were surprised that the nest is still in place, "said Sergei Berezovsky, Technical Director of DTEK Dneprooblenergo.
The wires, which were in fact already inside a nest weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms, began to corrode.
At any moment, the birds could have been electrocuted.
And locals risked being left without light because of damaged wires.
That is why the linemen started the operation to save the nest, not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme of nest transfer, helped.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
A well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised power engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
For starters, it has been estimated that there are more than 50 genuine "apartments" in a state of disrepair in the region.
Special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded for their reconstruction.
The base was splashed with willow branches and then moved to the old nest.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a base for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Only then will the storks build their own dwellings.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskovsky District.
Next to the power pole, a new reinforced concrete pillar was erected and a platform was placed on it with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
The other day, a similar housewarming party took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky District, in grandmother Anya's backyard.
Here, the platform was fixed in its former place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has been overhauled.
By the end of the year, another four nests in Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovsk region are expecting the same reconstruction.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
The other day, sad news flew around the whole region: in the village of Ust-Kamenka, Apostolovsky district, on the opening day of pheasant hunting, poachers shot a swan family living on a local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not at all afraid of humans - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now employees of the Apostolovsky District Police Department are working out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The "Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, National Unity Day, the Russian March, coordinated with the City Hall, will take place in Moscow.
According to the Levada Center poll, support for the Russian March is growing - already 40% of citizens approve of the idea of holding it to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens, to varying degrees, approve of the holding of "Russian marches": 11% of them view such actions positively and 29% - "rather positively."
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing: in 2006, only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010, twice as many citizens (28%) supported the holding of such events.
Only 7% of Russians view Russian Marches "definitely negatively," while 19% view them "rather negatively."
Another 35% were unable to express their opinion on the action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall has agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, the head of the capital's security department, Alexei Mayorov, announced today.
This nationalist action has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
To the question of sociologists, "Have you heard of the" Russian Marches "being held in Russia on November 4 under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?," three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) had heard about the "Russian Marches."
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous nationalist rally took place on Manezhnaya Square, which turned into a mass riot.
Levada Center also asked Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the right answer (People's Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens plan to celebrate this holiday.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) do not plan to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow City Hall Coordinated the "Russian March" in Lublino
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublino.
This was reported by Dmitry Demushkin, leader of the "Russians" association and organizer of the march.
In addition to the march in Lublino, a rally and a rock concert by the Kolovrat group, also coordinated with the authorities, will take place on National Unity Day.
How the "Russian March-2012" took place
On National Unity Day in 2012, nationalists marched from Yakimanskaya Embankment to the Central House of Artists, where a rally was held.
Organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand, the Ministry of Internal Affairs put the figure at 6 thousand.
Report: Obama campaign considered dropping Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 race.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated book about the 2012 campaign, Doubled Betting: The Game Changed 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's closest aides conducted "extensive focus group research and opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise fading hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times's political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book details an effort by senior campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to assess the impact of former Secretary Clinton's vice presidential nomination on the vote.
The possible replacement was a closely guarded secret at the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that a replacement was being considered.
The book, "Betting Doubles," claims that Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship," but ultimately abandoned the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral roll would not "significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I was actively advocating a lot of things and it was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we were thinking, "Oh God, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the study as a "necessary check," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested a lot in exploring whether the move would pay dividends on the ballot.
"Campaign staffs don't spend that much money on polls and focus groups if they don't take something seriously," Martin said on AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew of a possible reshuffle.
While Daley said he did not think the president was "aware" of a possible replacement, the former chief of staff acknowledged that "maybe" Obama knew.
Martin added that "The stakes are doubled" does not provide a clear answer to whether the political probes have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama was unaware of the study to exclude Biden from the ballot.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Do you want ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first ice cream that glows in the dark with the help of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a glowing meal.
He came up with the idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the luminous protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising pH levels in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you pour, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company Lizzie Me, I'm Delicious, says: "It's an incredible thing, but it's still very early days when it comes to production, so for £200 you get about 2g of the substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up with protein, it will raise pH levels and the ice cream will start to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seemed perfect to introduce it on Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
On the other hand, it tastes pretty good.
Experimental company Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and sugary gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
"Avangard" coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about his team's preparation for the KHL regular championship match against "Salavat," noted that the residents of Omsk conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg."
The specialist emphasized that "Vanguard" needs to pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogorsk Metallurg, "the official website of Avangard quotes Chebaturkin as saying.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Skipped because of their mistakes, because of the failure to complete the game task.
We knew the opponent had the performers.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks from the turn - three goals were scored against us.
Very good implementation.
Were those mistakes taken into account in the build-up to today's game?
We thoroughly analyze every match with the guys, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was over and the score was 2-0.
Missed a goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period began to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in plugging the defenders in.
We have to defend as a team.
Right now, Vanguard has a long home series, matches are played every other day - is the team tired?
All teams are in the same situation.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and fulfill your game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the job, it's not that difficult.
Because of new rules imposed by Russian customs, hundreds of furies have been queuing at the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets
Hundreds of furies have piled up at border crossings into Russia.
This situation arose as a result of a change in the rules for customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not give advance notice of the innovations.
Since October 28, the Russian customs authorities have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee cargo delivery, said Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Head of Eastern Customs.
The new model instrument applies to countries that have acceded to the convention on international transport.
Checkpoints operate in a reinforced regime.
The correspondent of "FACT" visited the border and talked to the long-haul truckers who found themselves hostage to the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are rising every day, as is the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here, cargoes are sent to the Stavropol Krai of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, they were still allowed in, and after they introduced these rules, complains the long-haul trucker Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who transits cargo through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is transported.
Minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand roubles (approx. 1,100-1,300 hryvnias).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars pay around 15 thousand roubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - no one has so much money with them!
Can you imagine if a driver carries a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but already to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand roubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for transit!
There are no conditions for survival at the border, laments the long-distance pickers who have settled in front of their cars.
In border shops and cafes it is always expensive, but we have never seen such prices as here!
The sellers got their bearings and quickly inflated them: 15 hryvnias costs a button, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
And there is one cafe.
And there is no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No washing, no shaving...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife has prepared everything for me on the way.
I'll stretch it out for a week, "another long-haul trucker, Viktor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Will my car get there in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of vodka? - we ask in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias each.
What, a crystal bottle or water insisted on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while you still have something, says the saleswoman.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the authorities of the region paid attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosievskaya and Novoazovskaya district state administrations have been instructed to provide drinking water to all those who are waiting in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, said Sergey Dergunov, Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Regional State Administration.
At present, emergency medical teams are on duty at checkpoints.
Bio-toilets will also be installed for people's convenience.
According to the official, the problem related to queues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 vehicles were idle at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk," respectively.
The FACTS will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency by the State Security Department of the Republic (DSB).
Information about this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "stipulate" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish forged documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archive, which concern facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is responsible for preparing the information attack.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
An employee of the department, V. Smirnov, is also allegedly a participant in the operation.
According to the special service, Smirnov, under the guise of academic work until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and had contacts with local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskaite announced that she was aware of an information attack being prepared against her.
According to her, the main reason is Lithuania's successful chairmanship of the Council of the European Union and the country's "aspiration to energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
Thus, she claimed that Lithuania was "not treated with enough respect" in the Kremlin.
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of putting forward "only demands" to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not conform to sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At the time, Lithuania's leader said that if Russia did not lift the ban, the country's government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the US, a school principal shot a teenager.
Teenagers have been driven literally to despair by the headmasters of an American high school.
The man, he said, had to pick up a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, child bullies threw toilet paper at the man's house.
As a result, the headmaster opened fire on the teenagers, wounding a 15-year-old boy in the leg and arm.
Because the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he is charged with aggravated assault.
Man released from jail on $125k bail
It should be noted that the shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest, in the American state of California, directly at passers-by on the street.
The criminal then took two bystanders hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to flee.
Earlier, a shooting occurred at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a tutor.
US school shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and put on a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I look more like a scumbag.
I haven't volunteered to hand out sweets in my apartment for the last two years, and I probably won't this year either.
But the statistics show I'm a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans - 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that suits will cost $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the height of fashion, sexy inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they can also be sexual eaters, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'm sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will hit our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes most searched for are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet suits this year.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't mince words.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, sweets, Milk Duds, Twizzlers chewing sweets and Clark Bar bars.
According to the US Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-craving children who have prepared to conquer our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and - let's not be fooled - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate over Halloween.
The one thing we don't want to eat is corn-grain sweets; yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, almost 35 million pounds of them are sold for Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a puzzle that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than haunted houses.
They have terrific titles, such as "Horror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howl and Shout" and "House of Shock."
Moreover, according to the America Houses Society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you're almost described, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "cool facial expression."
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, baby pumpkin fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving those pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the US Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's luminaire slowly dries up on your porch probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a more challenging task, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
The website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia has been restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been restored after a morning cyber attack, the press service of the authority reports.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs, Taymar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overwhelmed by a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly fixed everything, and by now the site has been restored.
"The damage to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
Recall, on November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted an appeal online, in which it confirmed the hacking attack on the website of the Estonian Defense Ministry and spoke out against the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Nor does Ukraine need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that a company of Marines of the Feodosia Separate Battalion of the Ukrainian Marines will take part in NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command-staff exercises.
Several schools and a hospital had to be closed as a result of the storm
Four schools in Zimbabwe's South Matabeleland province had to be closed because students were being attacked by... goblins.
According to a local elder, the children panicked and it was impossible to continue.
The tale of goblins may sound like a child's invention to a European, but in Africa it is a serious argument for closing a school.
Adults, too, are afraid of impure power.
In Zimbabwe, for example, a hospital was closed in the summer because medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
Inside, there are racing seats and six-point seatbelts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support, and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "Rally participants turning to Bowler have changed."
Some are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the harsh conditions and realities of a rally raid.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces know nothing about the "Fraternal Circle" group - Novye Izvestia
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports appeared in the media about the inclusion of Leps in the control lists of the US Treasury Department on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Fraternal Circle', we looked through all the databases, but did not find such a group," said the agency's interlocutor.
According to him, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written by NI, yesterday the US Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Fraternal Circle."
Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named among them.
It appears in the list as "Grisha," posted the day before.
They coincide with the data of a popular Russian artist.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, a creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five other people are mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR, whose nationality is not specified.
The US believes that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their orders.
Attached to this message is a photo of the singer and all his data, which correspond to reality.
Indeed, Leps recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the United States Treasury entails the freezing of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps aide Maya Serikova said that no notification had been sent to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the same Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, he has not been personally notified, though I don't know if he does.
"And, of course, it's all funny on the one hand, and surprising and unexpected on the other," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Runaway on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details about the identity of the fan who ran onto the pitch during the match of the 1 / 16 final of the Russian Cup between Yaroslavl's Shinnik and Moscow's Spartak have become known.
Arthur Grigoryants, head of the FCC of the RFS, said, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, that the fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently in custody.
"In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break into the field:" It turned out that this one, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He came to the emergency room - this was confirmed to us by the emergency doctor.
And then he pushed two minders away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South tribunes to the corner of the East and North tribunes.
He ran across the field.
Stewards are responsible for this.
Until the Sports Act comes into force, it is the stewards "area of operation - the police cannot intervene in what is on the pitch.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the Eastern podium.
At that point, rioting broke out on the East Stand and on the treadmills, "the FCC chief said.
Recall that, by decision of the KDC, Spartak Moscow will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiv Moscow and Zenit, as well as pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire crews were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50ft above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after being involved in a minor accident
Three days later, she was spotted stuck in a quarry by a man walking his dog
Firefighters descended the steep slope on a rope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky to escape after fire crews were called to lift it to safety after it was somehow stuck 50ft up a dangerous ledge on a steep slope.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted appeals on social media sites after it escaped to a quarry following a minor accident.
At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, a keen dog walker spotted Ruby stuck 50ft up a ledge in a quarry.
A technical rescue team from Clackheaton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carrier to lift her up the slope.
Specialist rescue officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a steep slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate biscuits.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Specialist rescue officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a possibility that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up and was found to be fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'Watching the rescue was terrifying.'
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing to have it back in our hands.
The vet said that if she had become exhausted and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were magnificent.
It was very brave - what they did.
We are so grateful and everyone has been absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson, from Keatley, added: 'We feared it might fall but it stayed there.'
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star claimed she was the backing singer for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and noted, "He flirted with me when I was 18."
She added: "It was a long time ago and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies that he ever touched Katy Perry."
The spokesman added: "She may have confused him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scare about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the EU-wide free movement area as a condition of EU membership.
There are stories of passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
True, Strathclyde has pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement across the rest of Europe, though - predictably - it has not made headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time tweaking their formal rules as they see fit.
As Scotland is currently outside the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a worthy story.
So old that it has become fossilised: the first time I heard a duck say that "independence means passport control" was at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting point lost in the retelling of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's orders at all?
Why swap the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the grand postwar plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the "Europe" project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or in favor of abolishing the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the euroskeptic Alternative für Deutschland - founded only this year - emerged from nowhere and won almost five million votes in September's federal election, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (our Liberal Democrats "equivalent) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan for a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis is a watershed moment.
Austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the single currency, have led many to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - as was true only for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has locked its members in exchange rates favorable to German exporters - which German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of currency devaluation, southern Europe is at a pre-emptive disadvantage in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
Behind Europe's current fiscal and currency problems lies a deeper problem of productive capacity.
As a result of the package of "green" energy measures introduced by Brussels - code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US.
This is a crippling price environment, as we have seen at Grangemouth.
No amount of global wage freezes will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, particularly in France, once the EU's most ardent supporter.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's devastated economy in dire straits.
The result is Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front party, which has just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split on the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU bloc in the European Parliament and against the single currency.
If - as is highly likely - anti-EU parties win support in this election, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my view: soon, growing anti-EU and anti-single-currency sentiment in Europe will converge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become the sort of vague "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suspect that the UK is distancing itself from this project in the hope of moving closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that the UK is likely to be left out in the cold of the Atlantic.
Where does this leave Scotland?
We may choose to become a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to the devil.
I suspect Scotland will be able to do well under a freer European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider replicating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to opposition to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be preposterous to vote for independence only to accept the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared if her daughter starts to develop breast cancer and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American girls and represent the new normal.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - it doesn't usually mean full puberty quickly," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"Once breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: How to deal with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a dramatic increase in height to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow or stop - something the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may warrant testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and low height in adulthood.
Drug or hormone therapy recommendations are based on a child's age, level of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but acknowledges that "suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls" feelings that they are different from their peers. "
The other big problem is clear: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to menstruate.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they deal with hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many touted theories about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise that matters most is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped lead a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Globally, everything from economic conditions and climate to genes seems to affect early puberty.
Another conundrum is that while boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the trend towards full puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair occurs even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy about receiving guidance from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It could mean an earlier than expected conversation," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls who blossom early need confirmation that, even when it happens early, it is a normal part of life.
American Boeing gets stuck in Chita as it prepares to take off
An American aircraft, which conducted observation flights over Russian territory under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8: 30 Moscow time, will leave the city's air port.
The management of the airport allowed the departure of the flight, having received money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will take off for Ulan-Ude.
Other reports suggest he will head to the US.
It was reported that the plane, which was flying to Ulan-Ude, landed in the Trans-Baikal Krai because of fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not allowed to leave Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, and they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, according to the terms of the Open Skies Agreement, the people on board the aircraft have no right to leave Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, and 34 states are parties to it.
Observation flights are conducted over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, and enhance crisis-prevention and crisis-management capabilities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late celebrities earn - in the US?
Madonna topped the list of highest-earning celebrities in 2013, earning $125 million.
But she was outsold by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous earnings from October 2012 to October 2013 totaled $160 million.
Significantly behind him are other deceased celebrities, who "earned" several times less last year.
Second on Forbes' list of the wealthiest retired celebrities for the year was Elvis Presley, with $55 million, followed by Peanuts comic book author Charles Schulz with $37 million.
They were joined in the top five by Elizabeth Taylor, last year's leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein also made the list.
Igor Gulyaev's first boutique opened in Moscow
The opening of Igor Gulyaev's first flagship boutique in Moscow took place on October 23.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now even more fashion fans will be able to appreciate them - his first boutique has finally opened in Moscow, about which the designer organized a dolce vita-style party.
I am sure that the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That is why I am especially pleased that I have opened a store in Moscow.
This is not just an office, but a place where there is really a part of me.
It was with these words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all comers... to try out the eye-catching models!
Jet manufacturers feuding over seat width when big orders are at stake
A bitter dispute has broken out between the world's leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of long-haul travel seats, setting the stage for a fierce confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy passengers, whose interests are not always at the center of airlines "concerns, with the amount of space allocated to them playing a key role in claims about the effectiveness of the latest planes offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 centimeters) in economy cabins, but its main US rival Boeing says it is up to airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul planes, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the back of the plane - especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - is central to claims of cost-effectiveness of new "mini-Airbus" projects.
Boeing says its revamped 777X will seat 406 people, based on economy-class seats more than 17 inches wide, with 10 in each row.
Airbus says a rival version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats arranged in nine rows.
Aircraft giants often exchange blows on technical issues through advertisements in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly ahead of the Dubai air show, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what a new advertising war could look like by showing financiers a slide showing three people in a restaurant huddled together, entitled "Would you agree to it?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people are gaining weight, but plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the US Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor is sticking to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist girth of what was recently called the "jet public" was already there.
Airbus says it has commissioned research showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's seat-size figures and says manufacturers should not get involved in decisions about how airlines balance fares and amenities.
According to her, research shows that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
"It really comes down to giving airlines choice and the ability to do what they think they need to do to succeed," Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver said.
They don't want us to decide for them what will benefit them.
They know their job better than anyone.
For passengers, the issue is increasing lateral space, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind the dispute is a race to the bottom for aircraft orders, estimated at at at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating arrangement is precisely what is fueling the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing report a 20 percent increase in profitability per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the segment's market leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's stated performance is based in part on a comparison of the 777X's 10-seat rows with the original 9-seat row layout of the 777 design.
The unit cost gain is reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout currently in use.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our designs," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus's head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777 indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating, which can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"Eighteen-inch wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, commercially, Airbus's offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777 model," said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling jet salesmen even bring roulette wheels with them to check competing plans.
While touting comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with very tight cabin layouts for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10-seat rows, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications by offering wider aisle seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "take off," but could divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could deprive smokers of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials can begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were encouraging.
"We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to be overcome with these modern tools," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine kick.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were then given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And mice that were not given the vaccine "relaxed," a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers said.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be given so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Kristall said if the future human vaccine were fully safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it could help them get rid of the habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: one third of rural settlements in Moscow region are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of Moscow Region Yuri Oleynikov stated that almost one-third of rural settlements in Moscow Region are fully subsidized
In total, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83% - 100%.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion roubles are allocated from the regional budget, "Oleynikov said.
The Vice Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytischi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - had budget revenues of more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements in many districts are less than 3 million roubles, "this is not enough at all."
Expenditures on maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region amount to more than 70%, "while there is a decline in the quality of services," noted Oleynikov.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of Moscow region to consider, by the end of November, which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed in the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of Moscow Region announced that, as part of the administrative reform, it was planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements in the Moscow area.
Also in Mozhay, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomna districts, Lyubertsi and Kotelniki there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
Discussions in the region's cities and regions will begin in November.
Igor Bryntsalov, Chairman of the Moscow Regional Duma, also stated that in total, about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow region are planned to be united within the framework of the forthcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow area, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 have a subsidy base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina has made no secret of how much she enjoys raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to mess with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
In the past week, Diana has twice spoken to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook showing her teaching her children to read.
And yesterday she treated fans to a glimpse of how she dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
Ready for the broom races! our first halloween, "Diana captioned a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
It is no wonder, after all, that they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, because they were born in America.
Germany is Europe's first to introduce "gender indeterminate" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow children born of hermaphrodites to be registered as "indeterminate" instead of male or female.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "sex" field of the birth certificate blank for a while.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents may temporarily write "X" (indefinite).
The decision is aimed at discouraging parents from rushing to have sex-reassignment surgery.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denies making changes to seaside leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on public land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without going through a tender process after they expired in August 2005.
It is now investigating claims that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's clandestine involvement in the properties, following testimony given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
During several years of debate that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put to an open tender.
Tenants were opposed, and wanted longer tenancies.
In 2009, business leases at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without public bidding.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open tenders.
But he denied the changes were made at the behest of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi admitted had urged changes to the government's tenancy policy.
ICAC's transcript of telephone conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who joined the Ports Department after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the issue discussed in those phone calls about the development of a commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley to Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Senior official says Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed to Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
On at least two occasions earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes against cargo of missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for "authenticity"
An "authenticity" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it contemplates expanding repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457 visas to fill unskilled jobs or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The government's consultation document was published today, while former Labor MP Maxine McCue criticised the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like" foreigners are at the back of the queue "and" Australians work first "are a very unpleasant throwback to the days when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The submission outlines 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criteria are adopted, the visa applicant could be investigated for "whether the applicant is genuine in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the business."
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of 457 visa holders, as previously businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers would then hire hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving by boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's grief-stricken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia and has been supported since his father's death on Wednesday by a cousin who was also on board.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Semyon Varlamova's girlfriend says hockey player suffers from alcoholism
The girlfriend of ice hockey player Semyon Varlamov, Evgenia Vavrinyuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, Russian News Service reports.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," the woman said.
Recall that Wawrinka sued for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team, Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by her hair and beat her - after the attack, she suffered injuries to her arms, chest, abdomen and neck.
Varlamov himself turned himself in to Denver police and confessed to the beating, giving a detailed description of what happened.
He was arrested but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete's movements around the country, but banned him from approaching Wawrinka.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact of the HS2 rail project on Scotland.
The HS2 project aims to open a high-speed link to Scotland and the north of England, with Phase One starting in 2026
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "unite the UK."
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "delighted" at the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase II is completed, the lines will be extended to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and shorter journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis on our rail network.
But it is also about connecting cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will benefit from HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all, and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
The Tories "New Hope for Nuclear Power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
Combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) adversely affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power does without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste.
Recently, scientists have turned their attention to thorium, another radioactive element in Mendeleev's system.
It is found all over the world, and experts say that its decomposition does not leave waste to be stored for centuries.
Rules for using electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in place for the time being
Australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the US to relax rules on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, as long as they remain in "Flight Mode."
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which has required US airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain security at all times and require passengers to comply with safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already been in discussions with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to expand the use of its on-board entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the regulator's guidance.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority considering allowing the use of electronic devices because we do think it will improve customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our planes," a spokesman said.
Qantas said it would adhere to the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change it," she said.
The FAA's ruling applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be looking closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleets.
Carriers will have to prove that their planes are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, and revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage regulations, and passenger instructions.
"Once the airline has verified and validated the soundness of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books, and smartphones, at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, the group recommended that heavier devices be placed under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan hears the notes of extremism in the anthem of Kuban
A football match between Anzhi and Kuban turned into a political clash between the authorities of Krasnodar Krai and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag and the anthem of Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday proposed to Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court, because the anthem of Krasnodar Krai allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, in particular, calls for war with "basurmans."
Take the anthem of Krasnodar Krai, this time in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one is doing it.
"You are remembered here as a native mother, as an enemy, as a basurmanin, we are going to a mortal battle" - for which reason such words should be written in the anthem, and for which some believers should be harassing other believers, "expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov, Chairman of Parliament Khizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin Ensures Impunity for His Friend Assad
And now there is news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles that were reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition of destroying its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of a Russian-brokered agreement that allowed the US to avoid the military operation that it came close to this summer.
Our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell you more about the weapons and what it all means for the Syrian president.
Washington has said the Assad regime will be punished for doing so.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed by poison gas in August.
And the punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad's friend, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A team of international experts reported that Syria had destroyed declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer and harder task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, this is about a thousand tons.
Earlier, Washington said Assad's days were numbered.
I believe Assad must go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when.
It is no longer legitimate and must go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
Its opponents are divided and poorly armed.
Its people are being forced from their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Bashar al-Assad is widely believed to have escaped punishment for the massacre.
The chemical weapons agreement has been hailed as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has given the impression of being cooperative.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child starves to death, its mothers are hardly relieved that they were not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is holding on for now.
And he is changing arms for power.
The President of the Russian Federation has created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry in charge of construction and housing and communal services and offered to head it to Mikhail Menu, the former governor of Ivanovo Oblast, during a face-to-face meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menem at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, and Meng did not refuse to head the new agency.
Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.
Mikhail Men is the son of a famous Orthodox priest, Archpriest Alexander Mya, and graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posad district, he was a member of the State Duma, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Region Government, and Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was Governor of Ivanovo Region.
Pawn shop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is struggling
At a pawnshop in the Bendemir Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is such that ValueMax, where it trades, this week became the third pawnbroker to list on the Singapore stock exchange.
Jewelry collateral is not just a quick way to raise money (S $1,300 in Ms. Amirthalinga's case), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above the 15.4% offered at a branch of United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can lend faster than banks.
That is why millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops, as families feel squeezed by rising costs of living and rapidly rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income households are turning to pawnshops to offset falling incomes as their economies slow.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, pointed to an increase in household leverage, largely due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks "creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore had the highest ratios of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand's high level of consumer debt, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that as prices rise, people at the middle and bottom of [the income scale] will look for ways to supplement their incomes wherever they can," said Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record-high gold prices over the past two years have increased the rush with which people are mortgaging their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to cash in on their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the goods deposited at the city-state's 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put a grandmother's gold chain on and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnbroker operator, EasyMoney, has seen the number of customers using its branches rise by up to 20% in recent months.
Such is the growth in the pawnbroker business that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's chief executive.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S $66 million raised this week in a Singapore stock exchange offering.
While some lenders have drawn criticism because of high interest rates, Ms Yeah says not only does the pawnbroker offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
"Customers are mortgaging items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt," she said.
Pledge is gaining increasing public recognition as a means to secure short-term, secured financing.
At the same time, pawnshops are not used only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary cash constraints," Ms. Yeah said.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
What matters to the population today is not the quantity of health facilities available and their status, but the quality of care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of Health Care in Tula Region for 2011-2013" and the reorganization of medical institutions in our city will make it possible to create an optimal structure for providing medical care to the population, including to gynaecological patients, pregnant women and women in childbirth.
Thus, after the merger with the city hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGKB for consultations with pregnant women with various pathologies, and to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital has been significantly improved, and modern equipment meeting international standards has emerged.
During these years, about 8 million roubles were allocated for capital repairs of the premises, and 112 units of equipment were purchased in the amount of 42 million roubles.
The intensive post for newborns is equipped with the most modern equipment.
In the operating theatre, a Cell Saver device is used to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, return it to the woman in labour, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
The Department of Clinical and Laboratory Diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's clinic has an electronic registry, and in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic records and medical records of patients.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it has become possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, women giving birth and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The Chechen natives have been arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of Caucasians.
The bandits are said to have booked prostitutes into a Strasbourg hotel and then beaten and robbed them.
The gang's leader was a 27-year-old former native of Chechnya.
Defender of "Bavaria" David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, the official website of the Bundesliga reports.
In this dispute, he got ahead of representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
Second place went to alpine skier Marcel Hirscher, and third place went to ski jumper Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the German Championship and Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin's ex-wife vacationes with actor Andrei Chadov
The ex-common-law wife of Zenit St Petersburg footballer Andrei Arshavin, Yuliya Baranovskaya, is on holiday with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is holidaying in Italy with actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiancé, figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Pictures from the couple's joint outing were posted on Anastasia Zadorozhnaya's Instagram.
This is not the first photo of Andrei and Yulia together.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a photo of the couple standing embracing on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit midfielder Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives apart from his common-law wife Yulia.
Recall that Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
It was recently revealed that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alisa Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to a top manager of the corporation.
Tasmania's $325 million health-care rescue package
The federal government is insisting that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be complemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to avert a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic illness and system constraints.
The funding decision for four years was made after the government consulted with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put forward an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a blitz of planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract operations, will help close the backlog.
There is also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston to improve post-hospital care, train health professionals, provide mental health services, and introduce personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will go to cutting-edge doctors" ideas on how best to help Tasmania's health system, "Ms Plibersek said.
The minister insisted the Tasmanian government would operate under a strict accountability and responsibility regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and report monthly on where it spends the extra funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today the $325 million would solve nothing "unless it is followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing."
Nevertheless, he praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first made to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid package will go a long way toward lifting this state's health care system out of crisis," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton said today's announcement represented "a solution similar to a placebo."
"The reason we're here is that the state Labor government has taken $430 million out of the health system," he told ABC TV.
When the state government is pulling out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is putting in $300 million, you can't pretend that this is good news.
Mr Dutton has asked Ms Plibersek to ensure not one dollar of the rescue package is spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's screen adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts exceptional staging and historical detail, but it is also harder to take than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, the film tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by her family.
When she starts rebelling, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic abbot and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never descends into vulgarity or sensationalism - and that is the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks being a test for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, watchdog group says
Syria has destroyed key equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring group said Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one facility believed to be storing toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the country's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The statement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was issued one day before
The 1 November deadline set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with poisonous gas and filling them with munitions.
Completing what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as a storage site, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
An activist group that has been tracking casualties through a network of activists in Syria said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters, and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The UN estimates on July 25 that 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
That figure has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safir for weeks, many with ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but did not provide specific figures.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are being driven by the compressed timeline of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all of Syria's declared critical production facilities and mixing / fueling equipment."
It added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors announced that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two sites for safety reasons, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria's statement, "abandoned and... the chemical weapons program items in them have been moved to other declared sites that have been verified."
It was not immediately clear whether the Safir site was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.
"I applaud the courage and bravery that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the monitoring group's Director General, Ahmet Üzümcü, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year in a row, the civil war pits rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against Assad's government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam.
In other developments, the center's head, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a large explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over Bali terror attack mastermind's sentence
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the conviction of the last of the plotters to stand trial and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the bomb-making devices used in the attack.
He could be released within 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, though they could argue that the man dubbed a "subversive" for his reputation as a bomb-maker should be sentenced to death.
The decision compounded the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
'I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He should face the firing squad, "Ms Cortin told AAP.
'I have to live every day knowing I won't have any more grandchildren and I won't see my daughters. '
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in a parked van just after 11pm on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar when a suicide bomber detonated a backpack packed with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while on life support.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anything.
To keep him alive, well, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not a lot.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to go on trial.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence indicated Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," Ms. Cortin said.
Until recently, he had no regrets at all about how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Cortin said.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAA: 'Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but don't make cell phone calls)'
Air travelers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect change to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their planes meet the new guidelines, and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of hand-held electronic devices in planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane descends for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use the devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other airplanes, modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this - it will be a win-win option," Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "school kids" when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connections to surf, exchange emails, text messages or download data will still be banned at altitudes below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So there are still no "Words with Friends," the intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when a high-profile incident occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in-flight will also continue to be banned.
The Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA, has regulatory authority over phone calls.
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when an aircraft is in the air," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been mounting on the FAA to relax restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no compelling security reasons for the bans.
Enforcement of restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult as devices become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passengers "use of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of airplanes, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals much less powerful than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when they turn pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices upload or send data.
Amazon.com. was among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers "use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with its Kindle e-book readers and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAA's advisory committee have expressed mixed feelings about whether the devices pose any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes device interference is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only anecdotal reports from pilots that the devices could interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during instrument landings in reduced visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible move to meet passengers who now use a variety of technology devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Driving schools to be able to hold driver's license examinations
Private companies with their own computerized driveway will be able to take the driver's license tests.
Kommersant writes about this with reference to the draft government decree "On admission to driving vehicles."
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
Pupils at such "privileged" driving schools are supposed to be credited with the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate will monitor the passing of examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theoretical exams and more than 20% of the field are not taken by students the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for highways contained in the draft government decree will come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also includes requirements for training to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, owners of motorcycles will have to pass an examination in urban traffic in order to obtain a category A license.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian rights after passing an examination.
Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea drilling rig is released back into the wild
A bird airlifted to shore after it was found emaciated on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
The water shepherd was put in a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month before being released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at a rescue centre in Alloa.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who was caught in high winds over the North Sea."
It appears that the bird was exhausted and was able to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added: "She was unable to take off again so we were called in for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes the UK's wealth and job creators want to see in its relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them for their thoughts on the UK, business, and the EU.
YouGov polled more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a broad cross-section of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The survey's findings will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries stagnate.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries like China, India, and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's muddled institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread discontent with the single market, with business claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in a European trading area - even 40 per cent of the largest businesses, traditionally the most pro-EU of all firms, agreed.
Last but not least, our poll of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a treaty change and a trade-based, rather than policy-based, relationship with the EU.
The result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - securing treaty change and better terms for the UK would secure a 16 per cent shift in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to renegotiate the terms of the UK's EU membership.
It also shows that business expects the review to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and financial unification.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be prioritised and, as our poll shows, this means a sharper focus on trade and fundamental changes to Brussels "regulations for business.
US intelligence agencies tap Pope's personal phone
The Vatican's activities are under the watchful eye of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that US intelligence has wiretapped all of the conversations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely monitoring Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped even before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under scrutiny.
What was especially important in the US.
The Secret Service connected to the cellphones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose the next Pope.
The phones of the residence where the conclave participants lived were also tapped.
American spies eavesdropped on all major contenders for the papal throne to prevent the emergence of a figure unwelcome in Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the "big ears of the US" continued to intercept the prelates "conversations until the end of the conclave on March 12.
Argentina's Archbishop Bergoglio is said to have been singled out in the US since 2005 as a future Pope.
American intelligence also spied on negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work in the US embassy in Rome, mining information about politics and financial flows.
For its part, the Vatican has conciliatingly declared that it does not care about American eavesdropping, even if it does.
From the leadership of the United States, the holy fathers have no secrets.
The snowboarder was specially photographed for the Olympic banknote
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative note dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the note is 100 roubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironing about the commemorative note.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they noticed that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free photo repository of StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website MegaReview on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertisements for RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in a blue-and-blue colour scheme.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other is a view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among students of the Repin Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - alpine skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end they chose snowboarding because it is a relatively young sport.
According to a Izvestia source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public regarding the widespread distribution of an image of a snowboarder from an Olympic banknote and is currently studying the situation.
But the State Duma is not too concerned about the hype surrounding the Olympic banknote.
Head of the press service of Gosznak Natalia Nikiforova told Izvestia that all the speculation about plagiarism is ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, in the photos on the net - to the left, - Nikiforova specified.
The person in the photo shoot for the banknote was shot from different points, then the final image was chosen, it showed the characteristic snowboarder pose.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic banknote is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, says Alexey Popovichev, Executive Director of NP RusBrand.
Proving the 100% similarity of the images on the banknote and in the photo banks is quite difficult, so lawsuits challenging the intellectual property of the image are unlikely to come.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative 10 yuan banknote was issued for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
Russia has decided to uphold this tradition.
Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially expected growth.
After all, this year is not going well for them, with sales down 7 per cent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers, Isaac Seps, told about all this at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Goods of Everyday Demand in Russia," which has just concluded in Moscow.
State regulation of the market was discussed.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, because in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a beverage with a low alcohol content, Shapps told listeners.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the ostensible fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that while many legal bans designed to reduce alcohol abuse have had little impact, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
Beer producers have been hit hardest by the ban introduced this year on the sale of alcohol in kiosks.
"We immediately lost 35,000 customers," said Isaac Shapps.
The Brewers have two forecasts for next year.
Optimistic - the one Shapps talked about - is that sales of foam drinks will remain flat.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from mass-market varieties to the "premium" class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical effects of falling sales of small amounts of alcohol are not yet apparent.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains approximately the same," Aleksei Sotnikov, a narcologist, said.
True, there has been an increase in the share of patients who consume surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who "hooked up" to alcohol-containing tonic beverages like the Jaguar, whereas ten years ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were laid off from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
Trade unions say all those laid off have been compensated.
But far more pressing than the problems of workers is the issue of industrial contraction in the region.
Deputy of the regional Legislative Council Alexei Etmanov said at the meeting that Ford's plant in Vsevolozhsk had cut about 600 people.
According to him, this happened back in September: then, about 600 people left the plant under a voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization.
Workers who decided to resign of their own volition were offered "golden parachutes" amounting to several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own volition.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it will stop there.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in difficulty, "he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large number of job losses.
Ford neither denies nor confirms this information.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and we will publish it as soon as it is available.
Talk about layoffs at Ford's plant in Vsevolozhsk has been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of production of automobiles.
The reason given at the plant was the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, according to the results of the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region fell by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment fell by 11.5%.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile during take-off and landing of aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout their flights, with the new rules taking effect by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited when flying at an altitude of less than 3 kilometers.
Because of the risk of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers on flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the estimated impact of mobile devices on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, Britain may also revise existing regulations for the use of electronic devices in flights.
The "Russian mafia" in the United States finally secured a new name - "Fraternal circle"
This week, new names and four companies were added to the blacklist of the "Russian mafia" in America.
The US Treasury Department has admitted three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan, and an Israeli into the "Fraternal Circle."
One of the Russians turned out to be a well-known singer, Grigory Leps, whom the US suspects of transporting money for the group's members.
A total of 22 Brotherhood members and six affiliated organizations are on the US blacklist.
However, many experts have expressed doubts about whether such an organization actually exists.
"The 'Fraternal Circle' statement is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups," Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at New York University, previously said.
In his view, the Fraternal Circle reflects a popular perception of the "Russian mafia."
"I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," Galeotti is quoted as saying by the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
George Mason University professor Liz Shelley agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they do act together, it looks more like a criminal network than an organization," she was quoted as saying by the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Fraternal Circle" unites more people close to the Russian thief in the law, Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhariya Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely connected with Grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandfather Hassan's nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals are not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they all had rather common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the Fraternal Circle of Grigory Leps - Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer - has drawn the Kremlin's attention.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partners, which is why a decision was made as to why it was included in such lists, said Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the head of state.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller Says Bulgaria Pipeline heralds New Era in Gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today was a landmark event: construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A dispute over a contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia's gas destined for Europe, raises the risk to conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline's annual projected throughput is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences even before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sex offences before charges were brought in 2011 against Caringbah childcare worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has been told.
But the commission's opening statement said it had "never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization."
Chief executive Philip Hare was asked about one case in which a YMCA worker was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, he knew of the first case but did not know of the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening speech to the commission was also inaccurate, claiming that "there were external reviews of the YMCA that acknowledged that the YMCA was at the forefront of ensuring the safety of children."
Evidence presented to the commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible ratings from a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and lower management had made a mistake in hiring Lord and failed to ensure staff understood clearly their obligations to report breaches of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion that the YMCA's corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting Lord's child safety breaches.
Staff testified that they witnessed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, getting them on his knees, saying he loved one of them and allowing them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lord's guidance and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnatt, the children's care manager at the YMCA's Caringbach branch, who was Lord's manager, "very intimidating and often difficult to reach."
The chief executive said he did not accept staff's explanation that they were uncomfortable reporting the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord was distracting them from the need to report him.
Mr Hare said he had presented to the YMCA NSW board his view that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was not "about the provision of information" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged had been made by YMCA chief executive Liam Wheatley.
He said this was meant to prevent evidence from being spoiled, but was "overplayed" and the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, child abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were "serious problems" with the recruitment, selection, coaching, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
São Paulo Fashion Week.
In her homeland, she is considered not just a mannequin, but a real star.
Although Gisele Bündchen gave up her job for a while to focus on motherhood, she made a special appearance at the fashion week.
Months of absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the podium.
Gisele remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she took part in a fashion show for the Kolcchi brand.
Fashion week finals are usually the most interesting shows.
Like what stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of luxury pret-a-porte, the designer has been actively working in the theatre and in the film industry, designing plays and designing costumes for many well-known films.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the final fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamic areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians and generating annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair has said he will seize the chance to return as Britain's prime minister, but admits a return is unlikely.
The previous evening, in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician laid out his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since leaving office in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers.
Asked if he would return as prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so..."
AC Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri has expressed regret over the draw in the 10th round match of the Italian Championship against Lazio.
The specialist also noted that setbacks at the start were caused by a series of injuries to leading players.
I am very sorry that we didn't manage to win, - Tmw quotes Allegri as saying.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
We didn't let Lazio do anything in the first half.
In the second the Romans added, but overall I cannot say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season we met the challenge of getting into the Champions League.
We are behind schedule at the moment, but that is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
But our squad is still good.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
Equestrian experts flocking to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award knew that the competition would be fierce.
But no one was prepared for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had taken his first steps just a few months earlier, this kid with his Shetland pony, Toffee, trotted through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
The inseparable couple - of similar height - received high marks for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Radry, near Cardiff.
Appearing in public alongside men and women in smart bowler hats, he pulled his cap back and proudly walked two-year-old Toffee around.
The judges praised Fenton for his uncanny innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and character.
Fenton was presented with Toffee for his third birthday last March and has been training with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a lovely duo."
They had plenty of rivals, but these two came away with the Gold Cup and the pink.
It was only his second appearance with the Toffees and we were all delighted when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy, from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: "The whole audience was stunned and everyone was shouting their approval and clapping."
He ran on the sand the whole length of the arena and, though he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares for.
Judging by the way he started, he will be in Horse of the Year soon - and I am sure he will perform well.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only three years old but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They rate the consistency of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his eye-catching outfit, he looked really good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the appeal is "subject to reorganization"
A Chinese newspaper that published a front-page call for the release of a reporter accused of libel should be reorganized, the press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper, the New Express, made a surprise public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write false articles about a state-owned company.
Now, New Express must go through a "full error correction process," according to the regulator.
The order to "correct mistakes" came from the Guangdong Press and Publication Authority, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation found that the Yangcheng Evening News Group newspaper, New Express, published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The management of the editorial office of New Express was disoriented," the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that a decision has been made "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revocation of his reporting license."
He also "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate those responsible for the situation and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his detention, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, claiming that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to command the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I felt guilty.
After Mr Chen's confession, the New Express published a front-page apology, claiming that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reporting.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of extorting confessions is still widespread in China, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
US-Mexico drug smuggling tunnel equipped with its own railroad discovered
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system, has been found.
US authorities have described the tunnel, which is four by three feet wide, as one of the most elaborate clandestine passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, whose zigzags are the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with discreet warehouses that facilitate the covert loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled in, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men, who law enforcement said were drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which posed a challenge for drug cartels to deliver their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard-long walkway equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Pensions rise in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November this year, BelTA learned from the Central Pension Administration of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
Starting from November 1 of this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic, which was applied during the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase of 5.4%, and a corresponding recalculation of work pensions will be carried out in accordance with Decree No. 478 of October 21, 2013 "On Increasing Pensions."
As a result of the recalculation, old-age work pensions will increase by an estimated 5.3% on average from November.
The average old-age pension will amount to Br2 million 295 thousand
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the Republic.
Expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of work pensions, minimum and social pensions, supplements, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated in November of this year in connection with the increase in the average per capita subsistence minimum budget.
The LSB for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47,530 - 2.1% higher than the one in force during the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, starting from November 1, the amounts of minimum work pensions, social pensions and supplements, increases and supplements to pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion has been earmarked for the payment of pensions, taking into account increases in 2013.
British police hand Assange extradition notice
British police today served an extradition notice on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had served the 40-year-old Australian with a "formal demand to surrender" to appear at a police station, adding that he would be subject to further arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex-crime charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, seeking political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard "issued a formal demand to the 40-year-old man to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station on a date and time of our choice," a spokesman said.
He remains in breach of bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the service of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the US to face possible espionage charges after posting more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
A driver who drove at 130mph with a hot drink between his legs has been fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 130mph (210km / h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When police stopped him, they found a takeaway drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates' Court, Howie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention.
The addition of seven demerit points to his licence resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 costs and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax on foreign property owners will cause London bubble to burst
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 Budget introduced a 7% stamp duty rate for homes worth more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
Currently, stamp duty on residential property in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012 / 13 financial year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "With the increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of high-value properties is undervalued regardless of the impact of the outdated council tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners unwilling to sell," he added.
The value of prime properties - the top 5-10% of the housing market in value - in London's affluent south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% in the past year.
According to research by Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6%, but were eclipsed by a booming "home market," with a surge in prices in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail relate to its mood.
Previous research has shown that satisfied dogs waver their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while anxious dogs waver their tail primarily to the left.
But now scientists say other members of the dog family can spot and respond to these subtle differences in tail wagging.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in forming the triggers that trigger positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it in other species as well.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to other dogs "tail wagging, researchers observed the animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the animals "heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs videos of dogs - either naturalistic versions or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail motion and steer the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw that the otherwise non-expressive dog was moving its tail to the right (in terms of wagging its tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilting mostly to the left (again in terms of wagging the dog's tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should worry about and which they should not.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs, and often wagging their tail in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side exhibits less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of that experience."
The researchers say these results could give owners, vets, and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal's emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting research fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left when looking at an aggressive dog, and right when looking at a contented dog.
And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail wavered to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming alarmed - the opposite of the Italian study."
He said the differences could be because dogs in different studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
Research into how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence for different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details remain to be worked out, and dogs are no exception," he said.
But, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails sometimes head one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a Glasgow concert after its lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield-based band were due to perform at the city's Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, singer Alex Turner's illness forced them to postpone the show.
The band's statement came after it was also forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to move the show to Birmingham's LG Arena this evening and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show at Glasgow's Hydro on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately is unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, while the Glasgow show at the Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.
We would like to apologise to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this has caused them.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will ordain new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope - that is the prerogative of a group of 120 "cardinal electors."
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting of all current cardinals, known as Consistory, would be held before the ordination ceremony.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a Consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from around the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals electing is likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of elected cardinals back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Consistency next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis's election in March, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe, and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from other parts of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a minuscule number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "entirely possible" that Francis would turn to cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - this is the first time for us.
Valero said popes used to elevate bishops from large congregations to cardinal, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he will call."
GM recalls a number of new pickup trucks in the US to fix seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix problems with the manual seat-back adjustment, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickup trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the seat-back mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"When struck from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants, increasing the risk of injury," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice posted on its website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's pickup truck production began in June and represents the most important mass production launch for the leading US automaker since it was restructured through bankruptcy in 2009.
GM notified pickup truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to review the owners' notice because of a 16-day government shutdown that slowed auto sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model year, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup trucks and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Obama Voter's Scream of Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to derail laudable efforts.
Obstructionism is no excuse for website problems with Obama's health-care reform, drone attacks
A Memoir of Obama's 2008 Campaign Is a Sad Reminder of What Could Be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in my second year of medical school and revive my sense of hope.
It's called "Daring to Win," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could be breath-taking.
The election victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to arrive at the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his approval rating was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is hard to recall those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, change has indeed occurred.
It was something I could never have imagined.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from passing the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our military from Iraq, repealing the "don't ask, don't tell" rule, and killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices, and the closure of Guantánamo, among others.
But after countless times standing on the side of the Obama administration to defend it in front of colleagues and peers, I have run out of explanations I can provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain authorizing the eavesdropping of foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the National Security Agency's collection of data on Americans "private lives or its pursuit of whistle-blowers who expose government wrongdoing.
He cannot explain the extrajudicial killing of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, or the failure to comply with limits on government funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusions, which state that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
Lately, he can't justify failing to develop a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I, at the age of 18, have understood that leadership could run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, running for office is not a predictable agenda, because our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events like the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, it is clear from all the examples I have cited above that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented an incomprehensible and crude alternative, seemingly unable to decide on his own policies or views.
I believed that, in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard about for so long.
But when Obama's approval rating dipped below 45% this week, it became much harder to go back to 2008 with the book.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton dealt Obama a resounding defeat in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they must get back on track and stay true to their goal.
"I want us to regain our attractiveness," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Tony Abbott MP has a conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over a $6 million carbon tax, made the statement as he tried to dodge questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to repeal the carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get paid leave or not," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the contest for the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by a margin of 53 votes after a recount.
Mr Palmer has called for a review of the election counting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after we voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system so that we can turn up, enter our data into a computer, vote right away and get the result at 6.30pm that evening?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil these days seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibility of electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job "very seriously."
Public office entails service to the community.
"We don't get any awards other than the gratitude of history that we can serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, further evidence that a global regulatory probe into alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market is gathering pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the unfolding investigation, which echoes the LIBOR interbank rate-rigging scandal.
While refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, insiders said RBS had turned over emails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to Britain's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
That trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understood to be on leave in his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to people familiar with the matter.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking into allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also begun internal reviews or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been scanning instant messages and emails for years for cases of wrongdoing.
News of the probes has jolted traders in an industry that in recent years has been one of the largest sources of revenue for investment banking's trading divisions, but which has struggled this year as low currency volatility has reduced opportunities for merchants.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the gravity of the situation, saying that a vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the FX market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their internal platforms means that "you can begin to influence the market at a very low cost."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one trader in its London Stock Exchange trading division this week after causing losses of almost $6 million late last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter was contained," Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The US Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that separate regulations under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, are constitutional under the government's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four more liberal justices, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were against.
The court also upheld the rest of the 2,700-page law, and further ruled that the health-care law's requirement that states raise Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed a lawsuit to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by every major Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Football the cause of division?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game is a source of scandal and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulyov and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society," politicians and media should be correct in their statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of his TV broadcasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if the Caucasus does not want to limit the birth rate...
All the speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, as well as measures to harmonize relations among the peoples living in Russia, which made the discussion cumbersome.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Biryulyov were "a model conflict that could have been predicted," but "we have too many people and authorities in charge of these questions," and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants has failed, according to the sociologist, and we must find our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov put great hopes in a new unified history textbook.
"It is also necessary to create a manual on the history of culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed criminalizing "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If you say on the radio in the United States that you should hand Alaska over to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky was very careful "not to inflame."
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring painful and acute national problems to public debate: "In the heat of the debate, there is little to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to talk about this topic carefully, and then politicians can make the same commitments.
We have about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole has been established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he cited a law that made regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace within their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what is adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
This means that subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
Moreover, municipalities do not have the manpower to deal with such complex issues, nor do they have the resources, nor do they receive guidance from the centre...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Hajimet Safaraliyev, has proposed the creation of a special agency with the ominous name "Ministry of National Security," which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar agency that was later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without portfolio," to whom you can turn if you want.
"We walk on the edge, shells explode next to each other, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive worthy informational support," said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the ROC for public relations.
According to him, there should be no neutrality of the state with respect to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here, Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "There is still a need to look for more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, but they are being pushed the wrong way, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "Either the footballer is beaten by the whole crowd, or the flags are burned, or the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another sport - rugby called...
"There will be no equal for them in the world in this sport!" the spravorosse said fervently.
Nobody will play rugby in the Caucasus! "Mr Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You'll still offer them curling!
It is necessary to know national peculiarities, it is like offering the Georgian "Zaporozhets"... "
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves with wild behavior in the stands - during a game with a local club.
Football will have to be banned across the country...
Head of the RFU Control and Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Grigoryants, said that Kuban was fined 500,000 roubles, reports the SE correspondent Philip PAPENKOV from the House of Football.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the arson of the flag of Dagestan by fans in the stands during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
Representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFU, were present at the meeting.
We have researched all available materials.
Kuban has been fined 500 thousand roubles for the inappropriate behavior of the audience.
Lawsuits filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei over Nortel patents
The group, which holds thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent suits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it beat in a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement suits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents cover technologies that help match Internet search keywords with related ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google's search business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable for comment.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC make phones running Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents
Google raised its bid several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was driven in part by Motorola's patent library.
"Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire at auction the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has infringed and continues to infringe upon them," the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president is sworn in
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt's political struggle.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy, and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years has been a banned organization that has been targeted by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pomp, traffic was stopped only briefly to allow his motorcade to pass along the normally busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi has been derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare wheel," his personal prestige has soared since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he sought to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but for all who want to see the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak through.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit and red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled hall where he took his oath.
Morsi later headed to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He received an official reception with an army band that sang the national anthem, during which he stood "humbly."
A military figure, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and people - one hand," chanted by hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a bastion of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to restore the powers of the president, who had been stripped of his post by the military council that took over from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court, rather than parliament as is customary, he is fulfilling the will of the military, a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
The event included a presentation of a new line for the production of welded steel pipes.
According to Denis Gribanov, Commercial Director of the enterprise, in 2011, with the arrival of a new owner, a marketing study was carried out to study the market for steel structures in Tyumen Region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install the equipment for their production on it.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million lei, said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which makes it possible to increase the assortment.
The plant produces both a fine profile of the pipe, which is used for personal farming, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large profile, which is used for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will amount to about 10 percent of its consumption in Tyumen Oblast.
Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it amounts to 157 people, and plans to increase the number of employees by more than 50 employees when purchasing new equipment.
The company is in the process of retraining its personnel, and the necessary specialists are being selected from existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutting machine with a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce production costs, as well as another mill, with a production rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company plans to master the production of pipes used in housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets a task to cover up to 70 percent of Tyumen Region's demand for these products.
Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the aim of forms of state support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and its leasing costs.
This year, 150 million roubles will be allocated for this purpose, two-thirds of which has already been spent.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises by 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Funds for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment produced in the south of Tyumen Region for the oil and gas complex are reduced to 72 million roubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long run, this form of support will cease, as the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the tax on extraction of natural resources, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not, and subsidies are becoming a direct expenditure obligation for the region.
With this in mind, the regional government prioritizes direct support for industrial enterprises, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget support will be related to investment projects, which will be implemented in production.
Many heads of enterprises expressed concern about the current situation in relations with the oilmen.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for industry in the south of Tyumen Oblast, and if it is abolished, it will be difficult to compete on price with Russia's middle belt, where labor is cheaper.
Moreover, the question of the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvata project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
It is an open question whether taxes from the oil produced in the Uvat district will be paid into the region's budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic to serve 240 hours for extremist social media video
Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory labor a resident of the city, who posted on a social network video of an extremist orientation, told RIA Novosti on Friday a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on the popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings were instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of human dignity committed in public."
"The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special procedure and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, sentencing him to 240 hours of mandatory labor," the agency's interlocutor said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this during a conversation with readers of his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that will mean that prices will have to come down, too.
"This concerns goods that come from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, but indirect.
But there should be no price increases, either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that association with the EU is a price increase, this is not quite true, or, to be more precise, not at all, "Azarov summed up.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, mass media published a report that a teacher of one of the kindergartens in Biysk had locked the child in a basement for educational purposes.
At present, investigators are investigating all the circumstances, as well as providing a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
Evgenia Vasilyeva speaks out after being accused of perverting the course of justice
Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose persona has been the focus of intense media attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about both embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - her relationship with ex-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry, and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, a person involved in the Oboronservis case broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva stated: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly the same: to extract from me any negative information about the former defense minister."
There was blackmail that I had to give evidence or I would be jailed.
Today, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 per cent confident of winning.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that, perhaps most of all, Vasilyeva was touched by the words that she does not care about taste.
It is probably a reference to the statement by the official representative of the IC of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected by a person involved in the Oboronservis case was found to be counterfeit.
Among the seized property are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, an art-history examination ordered by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, quite simply, were cheap forgeries, "Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they did admit that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while saying that I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal matters?
In my opinion, it is just lawlessness, "says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked if she would plead guilty to at least one of the 12 alleged criminal episodes, Vasilyeva said: "Of course not.
There is nothing to acknowledge at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
Just mislead the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the IC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is avoiding studying the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer stated that he and his client "are not allowed by the investigator to familiarize themselves with the materials of the case."
What prompted the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and has not spoken to the press so far?
Perhaps, as a woman, she couldn't resist the charge of bad taste?
Or are Komsomolka journalists right when they claimed a couple of days ago that she had "fallen into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of his family?
Viktor Baranets, a well-known military columnist for KP, wrote in his article "Serdyukov back to his wife?": "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative during interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took on some charges of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense.
Pre-winter hassles.
What to do in the garden before the frost sets in
Among the fungicides in autumn, it is better to choose copper-containing preparations, for example, 1% bordeaux mixture or preparations of Abiga-Peak, Oxychom, Ordan, etc.
Think travel agents are a thing of the past, thanks to the Internet?
At Flight Centre, the trend seems to be reversed.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its underlying full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, up from a previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If the current targets are met, it would represent a 12-17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011 / 2012.
Managing director Graham Turner said the Flight Centre firm had posted an 8 per cent profit in the first half and started the second half with good results, particularly for week-long trips to Australia and the UK.
"Since the beginning of the year, we have been operating at a profit across our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to report record earnings before interest and tax for the full year," he said.
"This includes Australia and the UK, which tend to be our biggest earners."
In Australia, the leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Its US business has made up for losses suffered during a seasonally weak first half, and is expected to report its third full-year profit in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, Barnaul police identified two gaming halls.
The first worked in the Industrial district on Vzletnaya Street.
At the time of the inspection, there was a game going on at the establishment.
The club counted 24 machine guns.
Another game club was found in Leninsky district on Anton Petrov Street.
Twenty slots were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been compiled for the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling."
The equipment was seized.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, police are searching for a criminal who brutally murdered two sisters.
After the killing, their bodies were burned.
As the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Sverdlovsk Region told Novy Region, yesterday afternoon in Kirov District of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in an apartment building on Uralskaya Street, the bodies of two women were found with signs of violent death.
The victims were soon identified.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg and the other a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented the burning apartment a few days ago.
Mikhail Borodin, the region's chief police officer, took personal control of his investigation.
The internal affairs agencies are working on various versions of the murder, checking alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented the apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.
Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also feature "extracurricular texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined English Literature and Language course will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a separate language final exam, with strong recommendations to choose English literature as a separate exam.
The Department for Education is due to issue new syllabuses for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
A separate exam regulator, Ofqual, will introduce a revised structure for secondary school leaving exams, with a new marking system and fewer coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to win back public trust," insisting that school-leaving exams would be "more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Research shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours per year, and in Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics on the timetable, coalition sources said that a massive school-leaving exam in mathematics, combined with a higher score on the league table, is likely to encourage schools to provide additional instruction in the subject.
The curriculum will place more emphasis on "real-life tasks," including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2 200 roubles
Starting tomorrow, hovercraft will begin transporting tourists from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe.
For those wishing to travel to China, this means extra spending
Traditionally, a puma ticket costs significantly more than a boat ticket.
According to the information service of the company AmurASSO, the cost of a regular ticket will amount to 2,200 roubles.
Transport through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 roubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not increase in price: at the same price, the Pumas transported tourists last spring, and a year ago - in autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia's GDP growth rate is not sufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers GDP growth rates insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned GDP growth of around 3% this year, maybe even a little more.
The real figure will be just under 2%.
Against the background of recession in a number of European countries, it seems not too bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate of growth.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done, "stressed the head of government.

Trip through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country - just one in 5,000 people
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bvelle is one of CNN's top 10 heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to be CNN Hero of the Year.
He will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Djamef Bwelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he only had a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
'You can leave the house at 5am, run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
Things have not changed much since Bvelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
Even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in that country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of health-care spending there is private.
"Their only problem is poverty," Bwelle said.
"And poverty prevents them from enjoying their lives."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his countrymen, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bvelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to the countryside to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others pile into vans, tie medical supplies to roofs, and drive through rugged terrain to visit villages in need.
They do not always come with luck.
More than once, they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like true heroes: a celebration of songs and dances and the best facilities that locals have to offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bvelle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip," Bwelle said.
They come from all over the district within a 60 kilometer radius of the village and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually performed in a school, municipality, or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate operating and sanitation equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's an unbearable pace, but the team's commitment is usually helped by village musicians.
"They beat drums all night to keep us awake and working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the brigade heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he says, that provides 60% of his nonprofit's funding; the rest comes from private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Bwell's group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that these campaigns can continue.
For would-be doctors and nurses like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe to join Bwell in accomplishing his goals, it is an opportunity they would never get at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bvelle," O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle pays for their meals, transportation, and training.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bvelle, an almost constant workload is not an ordeal.
Helping others live happy lives, keeping the promise made to their father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to be doing this job," Bvelle said.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel wiretapping
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, they discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany in the case of possible tapping of the German Chancellor's phone by US intelligence agencies.
Snowden has expressed a willingness to testify.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, Hans-Christian Strebele said, that he knew a lot.
And even though the National Security Agency, headed by Keith Alexander, has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the US spying scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the US electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei made the statement at a press conference following his meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA has learned.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, which is why we agreed that the government agencies of the two countries will provide all-round assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other, "Vladimir Makei noted.
He stressed that the Belarusian government will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also said that Ankara hosted the 8th regular meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission, which resulted in the signing of a protocol.
The parties have developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the Belarusian Foreign Minister, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic, investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as at finding new forms and areas of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that during the talks, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries made a decision to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the minister, the trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which should be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
Relations between our countries have always been very cordial, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
All the necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic ties and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey, "Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama Returns His Words on Health Care
Amid a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
With hundreds of thousands of people receiving termination notices from their service providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama tweaked his initial public promise somewhat.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Addressing what he called the "excitement in the news" about the shutdown, Obama urged Americans who receive the notice to look for other options in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You get better terms," he said.
The administration has said that no one should be surprised that the 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say this directly to these Americans: You deserve better," Sebelius said in a speech before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has been going "appallingly badly" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as anyone," she said.
"I really want to win back your trust."
An exasperated Sebelius dropped the phrase, which was caught on a microphone, to an aide sitting behind her at a House hearing yesterday after a heated debate with Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, about whether she herself should join Obama's health care program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sebelius to say why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt agency stripped of the status of mass media for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled to invalidate the registration license of the Rosbalt agency, writes Lenta.
Roskomnadzor insisted on revoking the agency's media status for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was set: the court deemed it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to make counter-arguments.
What is Rosbalt?
JSC "Information Agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001 Rosbalt has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
Moreover, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to law enforcement sources.
Talk about the publication's closeness to the security forces continued throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various agencies, the fact that Natalia Chaplina, wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project, also spoke in favor of such assumptions.
At the same time, Chaplina's role in the management of Rosbalt is not entirely clear: most often, she is called the "project manager."
Larisa Afonina is Director General of the agency, Nikolai Ulyanov is Editor-in-Chief.
Recently, Rosbalt has not featured in the ratings of the federal mass media, either in terms of quotation or audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the LiveInternet rating of visits to Russian media sites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), and the monthly audience is about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months are notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the lead singer of the group "The King and the Shut," and pogroms in the capital city of Biryulyov.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, prohibiting journalists from using obscene language.
The agency found banned language in two videos published on the agency's website ("Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot have desecrated the oil rigs").
Further parties are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the video materials found, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on mass media and appealed to the court with a demand to revoke the agency's license.
Rosbalt claimed that the agency's claims were inappropriate: first, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother's words in them were masked, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims in a magistrates' court - and when the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on October 22, 2013, consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the justice of the peace ruled against Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand roubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the Moscow City Court hearing - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalt's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by State Duma deputies (26 deputies signed an application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, on October 10; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CPRF).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the closure of the publication was unlawful.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the license would not be revoked.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that it is safer for the media to be in Russia today under whose jurisdiction it is a big question.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
By November 1, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare chemical weapons for use, the BBC reports.
Destruction of stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to an OPCW spokesman, the chemicals are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the US.
The inspectors "main task was to waste no time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and filling munitions.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to ensure that they are not repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November, by which time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of chemical agents.
There are many questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian claims will be scrutinized by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors of new sites to inspect if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not being completely frank.
The US believes the attack was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with an agreement brokered by Russia - destroy or disable all the capacity to produce projectiles, poisonous gases and liquids, and to fill them with these substances.
Now that this phase is over, the next step should be the destruction of the Syrian army's chemical weapons already in place.
It is estimated that the arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
Destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a two-week timetable to begin.
The OPCW's head of field operations, Gerry Smith, told the BBC that its inspectors had "personally observed the destruction of equipment."
"They no longer have the capacity to produce or mix further chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said that inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and verified that the munitions and chemical facilities had either been destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to inspect, the document says, but the equipment has been moved and tested by OPCW experts.
Smith said the process of destroying chemical weapons production infrastructure was "particularly challenging" because of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said the inspectors had not yet had time to celebrate because they were too busy.
John Kerry says in unprecedented admission that US spying "has gone too far"
John Kerry has shown a softening of tactics to defend US surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US spying "has gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "on autopilot" during Edward Snowden's high-profile revelations about NSA spying.
The leaks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually took some things on autopilot, because that possibility already existed - during World War II, during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 9 / 11."
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shine a light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough review to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is no abuse of innocent people in this process. "
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted in good faith and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are operating in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people, and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, buildings being blown up, and people being killed because we were able to know about these plans in advance. "
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the US, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration with National Security Agency surveillance.
"It is really important to the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts," Murphy, a first-term Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
"And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs."
News that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, though the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other disclosures cited documents released by Snowden showing that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Amid the hype, Murphy said his office is organizing a congressional trip expected this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other lawmakers involved are due to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said a degree of "well-meaning rigidity" would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves had used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is due to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address animosity over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
The new composition of public oversight commissions will increase the influence of jailers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new composition of the Public Supervisory Commissions (POCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the version put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
POCs are public bodies that monitor conditions in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, the unrest in the Kopek colony - it is through the POC that most of the high-profile incidents behind bars are made public.
There is a struggle between human rights activists and lobbyists of the security forces for control of POCs.
At a meeting of the OP working group on the formation of POCs, I proposed that experience in human rights activities be made a selection criterion.
"It was not accepted, and lists were formed without elaborating criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian network of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
When he was a State Duma deputy from Yabloko, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the POC.
The OP Council must vote on the composition of POCs in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand applicants apply for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized for lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize pre-recruitment for vacant positions.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will include 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, there are 11 human rights activists and 9 siloviki in the current composition of the capital's commission, and in the version that is voted on by the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to get to the commission in the capital.
On the other hand, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a representative of the Fighting Brotherhood, may re-enter the new line-up.
He was a POC member for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the siloviki, by appointing their chairman of the POC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights activists do not rule out a collective exit from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of siloviki is coordinated by a member of the ONC, Anton Tsvetkov, who heads Officers of Russia, an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying to promote any lists and says he has no intention of preventing human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list the OP now votes for.
He considers Borshchev's disclosure to be a form of pressure.
A possible success for human rights activists is the planned change in the leadership of the Chelyabinsk POC.
Its former leaders will be ousted in the wake of last year's Kopek unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the ONC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to law enforcement officers.
The human rights defender and chairman of the local commission was "missing" from the new lists, but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite having been expelled by the Federal Public Chamber for unethical conduct in May 2013.
Borshchev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions to be "revenge for Kopeisk."
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's revelations did not affect the ONC of Mordovia, which is considered to be a "security" organization: only one human rights activist wanted to join the new team, and she was not even accepted for the competition.
Nikolai Svanidze, a member of the OP Council, told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other council members.
His OP colleague, Pavel Gusev, says he voted yes because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Deputy Secretary of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Scientific Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service, coordinated the compilation of lists of POCs.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not think it is right to divide the candidates into human rights activists and siloviki, and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to impede the work of its members.
Mushroom would not predict the outcome of the OP board vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against Thailand jail sentence
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in a Phuket jail for falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver has appealed her sentence and been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally convicted on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false claim after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday June 10 while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells pending trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, not an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family were "extremely concerned" for their daughter's welfare and were waiting for her to return to Australia.
"It's obviously been an anxious time, but we hope she returns home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her holiday in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead the court to increase her sentence by up to two years and force her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to rebuild its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Yeltyshev," which has been translated into French.
Recall that it was his novel that became a finalist for four prizes: "Yasnaya Polyana," "Russian Booker," "National Bestseller" and "The Big Book."
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undeniable leader in the generation of today's thirty- and fortysomethings.
Virtually every publication of his rigid, life-affirming short stories and short stories is hotly debated by critics of every stripe.
It can be argued that the collected articles about Senchin's prose and journalism, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
Discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, are mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature," how they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most of the articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the sections "Paragraphs..."
