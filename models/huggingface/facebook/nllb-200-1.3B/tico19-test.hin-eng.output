Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends across EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries with varying stages depending on the country.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
A cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown pathogenesis was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China notified the novel coronavirus, now referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious illness requiring hospitalization while in the remaining 6% of cases there is an observation of a critical illness requiring acute care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK to Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 further expanded geographically and the current activity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world has moved beyond this country.
On 11th March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as per the WHO case definition were reported in the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Achieving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the countries' Ministries of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO, as well as the number of reported COVID-19 cases from each country in the world, are updated every day at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare it to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have thus calculated the 14 day summary cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day short cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the whole of the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and accelerated around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar upward trend (Supplementary Material).
Figure 2 shows cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This particularly reflects that as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to those in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions and protocols for selecting patients, including detecting and testing, that should be tested for COVID-19 as necessary for confirmation.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy reported a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admissions of COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (figures not shown).
However, they should be collected in a phased manner to supplement the current surveillance data which focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study in 2010-11 showed a large difference in the availability of ICU and intermediate care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and Intermediate Care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations at risk of &gt; 90% of intensive care bed capacity is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19 with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK.
As cases have so far remained in herds in EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK and hospitals and ICUs serve a generally defined regional population, information on cases and ICU beds should be made available primarily at the level of the Nominal Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare themselves for the continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC acute risk assessment, with the shift in approach to containment from mitigation, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is needed, as if not implemented in a timely manner, the anticipated rapid increase in cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The Acute Risk Assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have very little opportunity to further scale up their control efforts and reduce the pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is highly likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a sharp increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic outbreaks for humans.
Like its cousin virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have also been transmitted by bats and produce similar symptoms by similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people and men more than young people and women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a topical and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, purpose - science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of disease.
While there are still many questions to be answered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eradicating the deadly disease.
The outbreak of the novel viral disease has made the Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay home throughout the holiday and for several weeks afterwards.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was renamed CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2nd March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with over 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and over 3,000 patients dying due to the virus.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the public enemy number one and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on 7 January 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have been published, which isolated several patients and sequencing the virus.
The review attempts to summarize the research progress on new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in relation to disease prevention and prediction as well as some other nonetheless vital questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens to humans, with the common cold causing about 15% of all cases of the common cold 4.
However, twice in this century we have faced highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally saw outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the swarms of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The CoV sequence was released seven days later.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infection was reported among health care providers, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transport closed.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
As of the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly escalating, the final extent and intensity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
A multi-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 provided a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly those aged 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons were above 50 years of age, very few were below 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were below 10 years of age.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around Hubei in herds.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4. 8 (3. 0 - 7. 2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 - 4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the widespread traffic in China before the Spring Festival.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and covert single-stranded RNA viruses.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then fuses to the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cell mass; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms genome RNA variant-containing sheets with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then fused into the plasma membrane for release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequencing samples collected from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, the source of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-low sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV along with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make novel short protein encoded by orf3b and secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in mix with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained free and closed formations, was synthesized as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and transmission of CoVs.
B0AT1, may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
basic and intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cat and camel, respectively.
By genealogical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans is unknown and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving similar recombination with S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolins - a long-spice, ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity to CoVs found in pangolins.
However, the spread of the 1% difference across the two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaiting for solid evidence (Figure (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in artificial ambient dry environments for 48 hours and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to UV rays for 30 minutes at 56 °C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chloroxide.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
No detailed studies have been reported regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 at present.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
Normally, after the virus enters the host, it is first recognized by the host's endogenous immune system from pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
By various routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific immunes and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to assist the protective cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by killing T cells.
Tri-dose resistance including complement and antibodies like C3a and C5a is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, immunes isolated from a recovered patient inactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases even multiple organ failure and death.
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with characteristic herd onset is more likely to affect elderly people and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are mixed to be more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the first 425 case studies in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most often 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and the range was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, the recent study based on a population of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus usually require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the leading and early symptom of COVID-19 which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal discharge, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/ or hypoxemia within a week of onset of disease.
In severe cases, patients had a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and severe fever without pulmonary imaging abnormalities should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
The end December 2019 demographic study found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the family herd and herd generated by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
By comparison, the 2012 demographic study also found that fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were the main symptoms in MERS-CoV patients.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them required ventilation and this is consistent with the higher fatality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
Fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the predominant symptoms in SARS patients and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation.
The COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% as of 14 February, when the worldwide confirmed cases had reached 66,576.
By comparison, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on demographic study of June 2012.
Earlier studies reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while SARS-CoV's R0 was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data indicate that the spread potential of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The beginning of a herd is usually with the same family or a single group of people or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within the last two weeks from onset.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients who have been discharged from the hospital can transmit the virus again, which warns of extending the quarantine period.
In the early stage, patients have normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence with white blood cell counts including lymph cell counts &lt; 1×109/L &lt; 4×109/L were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in the blood.
In severe cases, the levels of D - dimers, a product of fibrin breakdown present in the blood, were elevated and the lymphocyte count steadily decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are indicated by bilateral spotted images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop unusual pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
Type - I and type - II pneumocytes reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension and thus reduce the lung's capacity to swell and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography often parallel the most severe stage of the disease.
The first diagnostic analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed pneumocytosis in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, formation of a helin membrane and porous leakage of lymphatic cells, and polynuclear polychondria which was consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and was similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the key criterion for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the epidemic, the diagnostic manifestations (which were no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone) began to be used for diagnosis in China on 13 February 2020.
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) without the need for any detailed equipment, using a dipstick.
If verified in clinical samples, it is hoped that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with novel CoVs, physicians can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients primarily by trying out different therapies previously used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to develop immunity and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain major threats to patients and are major causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important for symptom relief and life saving and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-penetrative ventilation and penetrative mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
At the same time, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic provoking reaction characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals which are the major causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilizumab, an IL6-resistant monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include alterations in T cell-directed immune response; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressants were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can produce serious side effects, dramatically affecting diagnosis, especially non-vascular ossification.
Nevertheless, short-term courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended for use with caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
As of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Subsequently, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other acellular RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to conduct two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
Also, barisetinib, interferon-α, iopinavir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with iopinovir/ ritonavir.
Interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immunity production from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
The antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and directly inactivate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
With reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood, their symptoms improved within 24 hours.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are required to propose the method for large scale use.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some plasma related harms should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overexcite the immune response and produce cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific immunes so rapidly to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes for effective antibodies or to test for effective antibodies to the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a wide range of ailments.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in a formula that differs based on TCM principles in the diagnosis of a disease.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or irrelevant because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Several provinces in China saw the highest recovery rates in COVID-19 treatment, including 87% of patients using TCM in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as number of patients and severity, must be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zheng and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatments only and combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature to normal, symptom remission and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the symptomatic deterioration rate (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, more controlled trials at larger scale and in more centres are still awaiting for the efficacy and safety of TCM.
It will also be interesting to identify the mechanism of action and if possible to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a great fear of highly contagious and deadly disease and even quarantined people experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, can cause increased discomfort and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological illnesses were reported, including persistent stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychological symptoms, dizziness, even suicide.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak may make people more uneasy and disgusted about the impact of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons in contact with them as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to disrupt the transmission chain from germ cells and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by increasing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent inactivating immune and/or defensive immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live-stemmed vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and in lethally challenged specimens and their safety against zoonotic virus infection is still to be determined before the start of any clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS was phased out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in epidemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and subunits of recombinant proteins have been developed and some evaluated in germ models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunosupporting individuals is a vital and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long time required in vaccine development (average 18 months) and the difficulty of overcoming the dynamic variations of CoVs is challenging.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently started to reveal its entire diagnostic process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare agencies to create diagnostic models to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the age group of 30-65 years, with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years of age, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying conditions and complications and those who did not were significantly older than expected (at median age of 51 vs. 66), indicating age as a predictor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Severe and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac damage and atrophy.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes which can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have a deep correlation and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
Correlation of CRP level with severity of COVID-19 and diagnosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate hydrogenesis (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also aid in predicting outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are the traditional indicators of heart or liver disease.
Key Diagnostic Symptoms: Chest radiography with other problems and the timing of the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered for prediction of consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as combination therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of the damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low doses and for short term in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological counselling and long-term support is essential to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 has different epidemiological features from SARS.
As well as replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection unlike other cold-causing CoVs.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities in the early stages or incubation period with great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmission did not occur during the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Large efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a downward trend in the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the descent phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19 which appears far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., modeled the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both the mid-turbine and throat cavity of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the new virus identified may become a recurrent case, like influenza.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to be a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in infectivity and eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The COVID-19 pandemic is compared to SARS and MERS below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and possible direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also raises new possibilities of oral transmission from the feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers, were probably due to clinical infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect people standing next to or infected people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and those in contact with patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from potentially infecting a person from going into the air or sticking to the surface of things, from where they can go to others.
However, with only 5% of the virus being fully penetrated, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can prevent viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm from entering the respiratory tract; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can pass even five surgical masks placed one on top of the other, health care providers in direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers should wear fit-out isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through his eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered to be the proper distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, due to the extreme similarity to SARS-CoV, it would have made China extremely cautious based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Centres for Disease Control consoled the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message was a great relief to the public, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to keep the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements as every word counts for citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in limiting a potential pandemic at an early stage rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness about the pandemic and periodically check and improve the response system of society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than women than young people, and the severity and mortality rates among the elderly are also higher than among the young.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients often do so when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and with greater prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be resolved, which are:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
The original nutrient, let 's say, was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
Without finding out the answer to #1 and #2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and the outbreak may never occur again.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and subsequently undergo pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, gradually disappearing like SARS or recurring periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have led to the co - evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness like colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the tide, demonstrating the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back into the limelight and shocked us with more infectious but decreased pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal disease and understanding the animal origin of HCoVs will help us.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.
There is also information about intermediate cell nutrients of some HCoVs.
Identification of animal nutrients has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-nutrient interactions in animals may also provide important insights into the pathogenicity of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information on seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of discovery as well as zoogeographic origin and intra-species transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the perspective of sequential evolution and gene recombination of viruses.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need for successful nutritional change and the implications of the progressive evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae which includes groups of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genomes of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kilobases, were named CoVs because of their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar structure.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyprotein is further processed to produce 16 non - structural proteins called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many genealogically-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that bats and bats are the gene sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant hosts of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have steadily crossed species barriers and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively large number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal discharge of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, further information has been collected by detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that HCoVs infection is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating outbreaks in recent history, infecting more than 8000 people with a crude case mortality rate of nearly 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak spawned a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several pieces of evidence support the gradual evolution of all HCoVs from bats, with viruses that are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show extreme genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoogenic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and binding factors of translocation.
This could guide or facilitate the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 strains, intermediates and enhancers with significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoogenic origin, intra-species transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are nonpathogenic in their natural cell membranes, but become pathogenic after intra-species transmission in the new membrane.
We will also review the trend of progressive evolution of HCoVs in which an increase in infectivity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the nasal discharge of common cold infected patients, different CoVs were isolated from several infected animals including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the last decades.
A brief summary of the chronological history of HCoV discovery (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, which later adapted to grow in the cell lines of WI-38 lungs.
In 10~20% of cases, patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of colds, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, along with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated by a sequential pathway in the milk-drinking mouse brain and by organ culture.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E that are symptomatically indistinguishable from infections with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally prevalent and are likely to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season with cooler weather.
Typically, the duration of progressive development of both these viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
Severe lower respiratory tract infection occurs in a few immunocompromised patients.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first well-documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the third HCoV detected, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be identified in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic recorded 8,096 cases with 774 deaths with spread across several countries and continents.
In addition to the most transmissible, it was estimated that approximately two secondary cases could be increased due to each case with a progressive development period of 4 to 7 days and maximum viral impact appearing on day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle aches, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as post-symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory-related abnormalities of SARS.
Transmitted airborne damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase in macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be especially fatal for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a relative of the indicator patient by open lung biopsy who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many efforts in researching HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The manifestations of cold, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63 -induced diseases.
In another independent study, the same virus was isolated from a nasal sample of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its peak occurrence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to inhibitory acute-inflammatory, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be associated with severe asthma outbreaks.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory illnesses.
HCoVs from all four communities have been well adapted in humans and are unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which recently reported causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs have acquired the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread among close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS, which is characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, are consistent with SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which has so far only been seen in MERS in HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, swarms of pneumonia patients related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a crude case mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of the genealogical lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs has revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the pathological duration and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is similar to SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection displays characteristics that are usually observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also involves characteristic variants of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it progresses to humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV, is yet to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 can behave as seasonal as community acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including infectivity, pathogenicity and continued spread after it has been passed to humans will have an impact on the end result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
HCoVs from all four mildly symptomatic communities have adapted well in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illnesses in humans and those that develop serious HCoV illnesses in humans have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the accumulation of adapted mutations inhibiting nutrient restriction factors would have to replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it becomes well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, community-acquired CoVs from four communities have been transmitted to the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not need a host.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
They need to persist and spread in their animal genome and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and HCoVs acquired from four communities.
At least at present, it is very contagious like community acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any coagulation or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution of HCoVs, natural, coastal, intermediate and enhancing nutrients.
An animal is a sequentially evolving host of HCoVs if it harbours a very close ancestor with high similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The parent virus is usually well adapted and non - pathogenic in this nutrient.
Similarly, the host nutrient provides HCoVs with a constant and long shelter.
In both cases, the nutrients become naturally infected and are the natural nutrients of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around entry into humans, it does not adapt well to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an enhancer nutrient by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and then transmit it to humans to increase the level of infection.
An HCoV may go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate nutrient and maintain locality over a long period of time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural nutrient.
The epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the indicator of SARS case was a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than the general public.
Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses which are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the seeds of the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most masked palm cuttings from wild or farmed areas not in contact with live animal markets were SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that masked palm cuttings may be serious only as a bee-enhancing nutrient and not as a natural host of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV immunity, the possibility cannot be ruled out that several species of small mammals may also be intermediate enhancers of SARS-CoV.
These all appear to be the final carriers of SARS-CoV.
Follow-up discovery of natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARSs such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none other than WIV1 has been isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat fecal samples was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of recovering SARS patients was able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest co-carriers to SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into a similar group to bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus penetration.
RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are genealogically close to bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest co-carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels with hoofs like camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivating antibodies.
A live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal cavities of hummingbirds, indicating that camels are the authentic cell-parent of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV generally showed mild symptoms but very high virus clearance.
Significantly, infected camels not only remove the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal tract, which is also the main route of virus removal from bats.
However, questions still remain as there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms in many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or some unknown transmission route involving the species of animals that host MERS-CoV.
The CoV RaTG13 isolated from bats belonging to the Rhinolophus species shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2 from bats.
As with cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine ancestry.
That is, bats may not be the closest co-carriers of SARS-CoV-2 until nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate zoonotic nutrient must have been from wild species sold and killed in the Hunan seafood wholesale market that were linked to several early cases of COVID-19 indicators of a potential zoonotic-to-human transmission phenomenon.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (human javanca) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2 related ancestral beta-CoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the genealogical lineage, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding region (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly variable despite greater sequence similarity across the genome.
An earlier study of diseased pangolins also reported finding clusters of viral DNA overlapping from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used several different insertion methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a full length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway of the progressive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Whereas the most sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, have the most genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is highly speculative to think that the extreme similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergence sequential evolution.
An alternative proposal is in favour of recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species.
As the driving force of progressive evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoogenic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Genetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mouse.
It has been reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian ridge CoV) found in three North American bats was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, found in Ghana, although camellids are also suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the current information on the zoonotic origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of intra-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be very close to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, bats have been in contact with the shared ecological habitat of alpacas, not humans.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas derive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bat rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are the gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and humpbacked camels may be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intra-species transmission from bats to hummingbirds and hummingbirds to humans.
The progressive evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has been further reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of genetic fragments.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interaction and the ability to fly are all conditions conducive to bat's ideal virus transmitters.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the hive camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted in these camels which have changed from intermediate nutrient to stable and natural co - nutrient.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has a sporadic transmission accident to humans and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They may be the final host of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, like the civet in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of intraspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or disproved in future studies.
First, bats may be co-carriers of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitat with bats by killing or mining for coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus had recently entered.
Humans are infected by killing and eating game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of immunity in domestic and wild animals are required.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from the various animal nutrients, three key factors in relation to the virus are also important in smoothly crossing the species barriers of CoVs.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered as moderate to high with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site 2 depending on the stage of adaptation of CoVs in the new strain.
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonucleases, whose deletion may lead to extreme variability and degradation or decreased viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is thought to suppress the replication of CoVs by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdecivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than that of their nutrients.
At the same time, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a distinctly low mutation rate, indicating a high level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted well in hummingbirds.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA in the CoVs puts extra plasticity on the genome mutation for mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of intra-species co-sequential evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
It is supported by a rich unique open reading frame and protein functions encoded at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly repeatedly change their replicates during RNA replication by a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In the nutrient that acts as a mixer, the fibrous change occurs most often during CoV RNA transcription.
Very similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to produce new CoVs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of virus - carrier in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor affecting intra - species transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of the differentiators between human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is considered to be highly adaptive to various nutrients, especially with mutations on the RBD of S protein.
Typically, RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively and intensely mediated by the nutrient immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors from various animals including bats, seabirds, mice and raccoon dogs, which leads to intra-species transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in RBD separately from human and civet viral isolates and 4 of them are located in the receptor-bound nucleus for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of Cvet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations that may increase the attractiveness of the spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be important in viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that its S protein may have altered binding similarity with human ACE2.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate a 10 to 20 times greater attraction of this linkage than the linkage between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-recipient would be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Several other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after intra-species transmission from their animal nutrients.
The outcome of intra-species transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and the natural co-parasites of HCoVs, such as bats, hummingbirds and mosquitoes, may hinder interspecies transmission.
Successful interspecies transmission of HCoVs requires the elimination of nutrient dependent factors and the reversal of nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus - nutrient interaction have yet to be identified and described.
Non-biased genome-wide screening of nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: return to baseline
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as gene coatings for CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoVs and serve two important steps in the process.
For example, novel protein - coding genes have the potential to greatly alter viral equivalents of acquisition or loss.
Among SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 has been found to be critical in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes cell transformation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs lineages, with a very large number of small recombination regions identified in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Recombination sites were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in hummingbirds in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other zoonotic CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly due to selection-pressure - free viruses, such as those produced by the innate immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows single nucleotide entry, leading to frameshift.
Last but not least, the progressive evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host organisms.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs which indicates inter-adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs structurally and physiologically.
Defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, for example, effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
In addition, in bat, inhibitory natural killer cell activity is suppressed due to the regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of the major tissue conformation complex category I molecules.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the bat's excessive metabolic activity may suppress the replication of CoVs and affect the proof reading by exoribonucleases, thus providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, resulting in new proteins or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in cetaceans such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without showing a strong immune response.
It is the secret behind why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to an immune response and overactivation of the cytokine storm, with the greater the immune response, the more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has diverged from CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly rapid in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
From this logic, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general theme that led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoV has been observed to have 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While seaweed and other animals have been seen in markets harboring SARS-CoV-like viruses, the closest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally created or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come into the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has led to a major shift in our understanding of the zoonotic cell of HCoVs in zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
The extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are native to bats and transmitted to humans by intermediate nutrients.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolin should be removed from the meat market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the hive camels for several decades.
These camels are an important means of transportation for the local people as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Diverse zoogenic CoVs are circulating in wildlife.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoogenic potential are very diverse.
It is likely that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In some areas of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the tough screening of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response planning should be done.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that help spread viruses, educating people about how to stay away from bats can minimize the chance of humans coming into contact with them and other wild species.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is for humans to stay away from the natural ecological habitats of zoonotic viruses.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the zoogenic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see within what conditions bats and pangolins might share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, then the manner in which humans come into contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate nutrient, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be undertaken.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestral viruses which are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continued investigation in this area will clarify the progressive evolution pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.
On 6th February 2020, our team published Rapid Consultation Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guidelines provide the appropriate context for our experience and the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest clinical criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" as per the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11th March 2020, WHO has designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted considerable attention.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China has issued a total of seven versions with fundamental changes in some aspects of the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/).
Now a comment on our guidelines by Zhou et al. They have proposed a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also provided valuable context for the pandemic worldwide.
We support and thank them for their important work.
However, their work needs to be updated in line with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Testing Edition 7) and recent studies for COVID-19.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations, or three items of clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history, to perform a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case:
Epidemic history: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) History of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or with other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) History of contact with a group of confirmed cases (within 2 weeks of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in small areas such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal, reduced or low lymphocyte at early early stage.
The diagnosis of the case made should be based on a suspected case with one of the following items of pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) Real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is positive; (2) viral whole genome sequencing is showing high homology to known novel coronaviruses; (3) Serum test is positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody is positive from negative to positive, or the ratio is increased by ≥ 4 times in the health benefit phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These revisions were based on the ongoing work of researchers who are looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory system samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and support bringing specific immune positive results to confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there is a wealth of evidence that reminds us to be cautious with patients with unusual symptomatic and allergic reactions.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify a person with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest finding out and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines periodically to offer assistance.

On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper items that can be purchased at one time in all their stores nationwide to two and one packages, respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkout sites and on the series' Facebook pages.
Shopping was reportedly being done in a situation where the shopper would need to quarantine himself due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase limit of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles said in its March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban in place, "many stores are still running out of stock within an hour of delivery", and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a sharp jump in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI raised stock to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers should try to increase stock, but this is made difficult by the restrictions imposed by the local council on the timing of truck deliveries.
In a situation where suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has decreased, Russell expects production costs to increase.
On Tuesday ALDI announced that after premature release of stock, some stores cannot operate Wednesday specials.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores fill up every night.
He said that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in large numbers, and then, when all the stock is sold, the big shelves behind are left empty, which makes the feeling of scarcity even harder.
Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News, said, "The idea of Coles and Woolworths [is] that if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizer could be [purchased] and available in large quantities, the turmoil could probably be reduced".
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that its stock had run out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the maker of CLEANEX toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, the maker of sorbents, insisted that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site, Domain.com, reported that in Melbourne, where fewer auctions are being held than usual due to buyers celebrating the long Labor Day weekend, some property sellers are giving free toilet paper to the first bidders at the auction.
The Thursday edition of the Darwin daily, NT News, contained an eight - page insert that was cut and given to be used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, the stores were initially reluctant to ban; they said in the report that they had no plans to ban shopping.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the limit of two packs of 12 rolls was also imposed on Sunday evening at the online British supermarket Okado.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV-2, a global pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which a disease spreads, not to the specific gravity of its cases, WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to act.
All countries can change the course of this global pandemic now.
If countries respond by detecting disease, treating patients, isolating them, tracking them and uniting them, said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are extremely concerned by both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "unprecedented".
In comments published by CNN in February, he said that no respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected through sustained global spread.
Gebrasis expressed a similar view when he said, "We have not seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
He further said, "And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
This new designation of a global pandemic comes after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "One hundred things, it 's going to get worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths as a result.
2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
An outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be as long as two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has generated severe global socio-economic disruption, prompted postponements or cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and led to widespread supply shortages due to panic shopping by people.
193 countries have closed schools and universities on a nationwide or local basis, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and color, and people from areas with higher virus cases.
The reduced travel and closure of heavy industries have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported mass cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is considered to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known individual with symptoms was later found to be ill on December 1, 2019, and the individual had no visible connections to the Wallace Meat Market group.
Two-thirds of the initial batch of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post reported that one case was that of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019, which may have been the first case.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with a decrease in new cases in China, there was a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very few cases may have been reported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valens, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before effective group immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and confirmed positive according to official protocol.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only those with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The original estimate of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused the death of around 97,000 people.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death tally from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those who died tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people dying without testing such as in a home, nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the alleged death toll] has been underestimated", a statement supported by descriptive information of a low count in the US. Such underestimations often occur in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
As of 13 March, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-case ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated death-case ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning by 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this threshold is consistent with the results of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of the outbreak period is uncertain and may vary by location.
"When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and begin to decline when nutrients are no longer available for disease", said Mackie Bonney of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when it will happen".
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to remain circulating for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, because it's so easily transmitted", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, and it "could turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the extent of the group immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and infected people may be allergic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cough), reduced sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemorrhaging, diarrhea or bronchitis. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluing of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised when these symptoms are present. Further development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be allergic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so the researchers have issued advice that people in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the anti - immunity ratio range from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell, which was initially 30% and later decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly by small droplets produced during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to go from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets produced during speaking that remain in the air longer. Breathing droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including while speaking, although the virus is not normally aerogenic.
The droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly into the lungs by breath.
Certain medical procedures such as tubal penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) may cause a delay in respiratory secretion and thus aerogenic transmission.
It can also be spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it may be spread by feces, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has dismissed the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed anaerobic cases, but anaerobic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, one person typically infects two to three other people. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, as is done after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decomposes its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically from the group of betacoronavirus, subgenus sarbecovirus (genus B), with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only a single amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between pangolins from viruses and viruses from humans.
In the whole genome comparison so far, the common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be up to 92%, which is insufficient to provide intermediate nutrients to pangolins.
Temporarily, infection by the virus can be detected on the basis of symptoms, although confirmation is eventually obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of infected secretions.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with many of its image characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to test for or diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on 17 January.
This test uses real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
Usually this test is done on the nasopharynx, but a throat swab can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect immunity.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Symptomatic image features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pulmonary secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Because of similarities with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19, without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is sharper and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and dumping that tissue directly in the trash.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community are unaware of where and how they became infected. Caregivers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by the use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spreading about methods of infection prevention; for example, rubbing the nose and grinding with mouthwash is not effective.
No COVID-19 vaccine is available, although several organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands appear dirty; before eating; and after splashing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions including 62%-71% ethanol, 50%-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute of exposure to a disinfectant to a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case at a facility such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons, etc. should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a cloth or a cloth when coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any cloth immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks may limit the amount of breathing droplets and distance traveled when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing masks can reduce the tendency for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene". Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
WHO has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come into close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and face.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all persons entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when going to public areas.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses from 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, while it has also recommended making a homemade face mask for those who cannot afford a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control activities aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum crowd recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was reduced rapidly from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce social contact while maintaining either virtual or remote physical contact.
The use of the term "social distancing" implied that, rather than encouraging people to stay in contact with others through alternative means, they should adopt complete social distancing. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine directives have been issued for the high risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and persons who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to detect infected people as well as implement other infection control measures and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of disease, efforts move to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both containment and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
More extreme measures are needed for suppression, in order to reverse the epidemic by reducing the baseline reproduction number to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services being overwhelmed and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can manage the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face masks and self-quarantine; intended community measures to maintain physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering programs; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleanliness. More stringent measures aimed at containment of the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also adopted a range of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to infected people who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and penalized stockpiling of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the US show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) are major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for emergency health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still hundreds of people die and health systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression can be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if earlier), otherwise loosening measures will return transmission faster.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic generate social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory assistance may be required.
Steroid use can lead to worse results.
Several compounds that are already approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources at multiple levels for hospitals and primary health care services, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capacities and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available through personnel training.
There are several opinions as to where the first case (so - called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of zoogenic origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police warned eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, and another doctor, I Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading false rumors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Health authorities in Wuhan were informed of a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which resulted in investigations being initiated in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled roughly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to traffic and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail exchange due to the Chinese New Year.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns) and curfews.As of April 2, about 300 million people in the US, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - almost a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report suggests the first case was on 17 November.
Physician Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
On 27 December 2019, preliminary genetic testing of patient samples indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
After these reports, doctors were warned by the police in Wuhan not to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission had initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a fierce campaign to stop the spread of the virus, dubbed "people's war" by Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history", a siege zone was announced to stop movement in Wuhan on January 23, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshensen Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Leichensens Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as conference centers and stadiums into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.

Public movement was restricted in many cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external restriction. After the outbreak reached its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
Beijing, for example, has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, only one case had been transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this case via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been substantially contained and the outbreak in China has been brought under control.
Travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed on the same day. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details on when the policy would end.
People who want to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.

The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning at 10:00 am on April 4, with a three-minute national silence, timed to coincide with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online while observing physical distancing to avoid new COVID-19 outbreaks.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to the crowding of the Daigu, a new religious movement known as the Shinchionji Church of Jesus.
Shinchianji Bhakti, who had come to Daigu from Wuhan, was suspicious of the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 or about 13% of the Church's 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, Korea recorded more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The programme introduced by South Korea was considered the largest and best organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus and isolate any infected people as well as to track and quarantine those who came into contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, rapid testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a breakthrough in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or praised her response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in four weeks.
On 29th March, it was informed that all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks from 1st April.

Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year Navroz.
As of 16 March 2020, the Shiite shrine in Qom was open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became a hub of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims to cover up the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down on March 3 when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggested that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test those who had the virus by then may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most lax of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to stop all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people to work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the premier public health institute of the US government - announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the US got off to a slow start in testing, making it difficult to understand the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The trial was hampered by defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria (which required a doctor's order afterwards) for people to qualify for a test by the beginning of March.

On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galia commented that while "definitely not recommended by WHO" it was "a very important sign of commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history". On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission and an increase in the number of other cases outside China, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the first measures were taken during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the reason for PHEIC was "the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was to emerge".
Tedros further announced in statements that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". On February 11, WHO set out in a press conference the name of the disease as COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "power to the entire UN system in response".

Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on earth: it is time to wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared", urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid "its worst".
Ryan added that current data has not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human on Earth will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by both the dangerous level of spread and severity and the dangerous level of inaction".

The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for many instances of supply shortages, which arose from the use of tools to fight the outbreak globally, fear-driven shopping, and disruption to factory and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Fear-driven shopping conditions were also observed in many areas, leading to shortages of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from shelves, which led to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a twenty fold increase in normal prices and also delayed supply of medical goods for four to six months.
This has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which WHO has warned will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daguerreotypes to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and high demand for food products in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both regions are still suffering from extreme food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illicit trade of vital products have been successful, which has prevented the extreme food shortages that were projected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decline in its vital agricultural production, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were also seen only temporarily in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released sugar - meat stocks to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to store food for such emergencies.

Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of 50-60%.
Walking to shopping centres in March fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing thermal scanners to check shoppers' temperatures, and canceling gatherings. A United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 to 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty that they would not have been in without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's roughly 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck at home in the inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the US and the unemployment rate could fall to 32%, according to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left several million migrant workers unemployed (paid through daily wages). The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. In Germany, almost half a million companies have sent their workers on government-subsidized short-term working schemes called Kurzarbet.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organisations globally as well as individuals both employed and freelancing.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector endeavoured to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and where possible, supporting artists.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions around the world and to varying degrees, were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, gatherings and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the outbreak is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social gatherings, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome, which take place during the final week of the Christian Lenten season, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
As the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed its churches and chapels and evacuated Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies also canceled services at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras and limited public gatherings.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the outbreak-affected areas and later closed pilgrimage sites, while Saudi Arabia also banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as civilians to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption to the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted planning for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers taking the online approach, with a significant increase in new sign-up rates reported at many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many big theatres like the Broadway ones also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as creating live streaming of the concert or web-based "events" to promote the performances, distribution and their work by artists.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as humor and distraction amidst the uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a growing bias, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In reports since February (when most cases were still confined to China), racist sentiments of Chinese people in various groups around the world have been documented as deserving of the virus or deserving of just punishment.
Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for the Chinese and people in virus-affected areas.
Following the progression of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was popular on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported rising levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", which was considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from North East India, which borders China, who study in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Bharatiya Janata Party state unit president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese have destroyed nature and "so God has taken revenge on them".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comment, calling it "erroneous". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents was fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Several newspapers with paywalls removed them for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Several scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of virus and for detecting the immunity produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunology can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunoassays show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities in how much has been tested across countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case mortality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasogastric faeces or mucus samples can be examined.
Usually results are available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with throat loops is reliable in the first week of disease.
Later the virus may disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively, sample material can then be taken from the airway from the inside by suction catheter or coughing material (bulgams) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin, and formed the basis for the delivery of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test kit by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Koganbiotech developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene found in SARS-CoV-2 in particular. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 screening kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories via International Reagent Resources.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kit had inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and caused problems with testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed a day for the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate testing until then.
The test was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization and US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
As of 5th March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available across the country as of 9th March 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; samples should be collected and processed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was notified of developing a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a high volume test that can be performed within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests being performed over a 24-hour period from a single machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had earlier issued similar authorizations to Holological, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Sheffield likewise received an EUA from the FDA for an examination that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to scale up production to 50,000 tests per day. A test kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal immunity that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, with the hope that this rapid influenza test can produce results in 15 to 20 minutes.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that chest radiography has little clinical significance in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may be available even before symptom onset.
The characteristic features of CT include bilateral multilob ground - glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the subplural effect, crazy pewing and consolidation develop.
The study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the source point of the current epidemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific, with many of the imaging characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening or first line screening for the diagnosis of COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to determine immunity starting in individuals from 7 days or so after onset of symptoms and to detect infection for monitoring of people. Testing can be done in central laboratories (CLTs) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to see the immune response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from a skin puncture.
The first phase of clearance of testing other than PCR methods is not required.On 26th March 2020, FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency as needed and thus are now able to distribute their own immunoassays.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization. At the end of March 2020, EuroImmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR testing of viral RNA.
Immunologists can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the immunoassay kits they had purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong plans whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "Emergency Department will provide the patient with a sample tube", they will spit back in it and get the test results shortly. British NHS announced that they are launching a scheme to screen for suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to hospital or the risk of disinfecting the ambulance used.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea perform the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory setting and performed 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the examination is ordered by the doctor, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Drive-through checks were offered in several major cities till 19 March.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey found that by week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested, including week 12/2020, and 33,491 (6.9%) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion & Rembrandt Hospital developed and tested the method of combining samples and, if the combined sample is found to be positive, further testing to develop samples from 64 patients simultaneously. In Wuhan, a 2,000-meter temporary emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) by BGI was launched on February 5, 2020, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has seen that if this testing capability had not been introduced, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the related cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory has been immediately followed by Hua-Yen Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multipurpose open source frameworks have been released by Origami Essai that can test up to 1122 samples of COVID19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Prior to March, deficiencies and insufficient quantities of the reagent were a problem in large scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore sampling protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for coronavirus at a per capita rate than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to reach a larger population.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing capability and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO adopted and sent the German method for developing kits to low-income countries lacking resources to develop themselves.
Germany method published on 17 January 2020; protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. At the outbreak's onset, there were problems between China and the United States over the reliability of test kits and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the testing demands and recommendations by health experts.
In contrast, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capability, especially in private sector laboratories, developed over the course of several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing screening programs is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for screening due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to thousands of outstanding tests piling up in private U.S. laboratories and strained supply of straws and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in its testing kits.
In the United States, there was a shortage of testing kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private testing. Spain purchased testing kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioegy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm said that the incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the false testing kits and replace them with the second testing kits made available by Shenzhen Biog. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be dumped in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they did not use them. The UK, which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, declared that they were not usable.
After testing, quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those who came in contact with positive SARS-CoV-2 results in positive results.
At the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in the town of Vò, Italy, doubled down on the entire population of about 3,400 people at about ten days' intervals.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all those with detected cases were quarantined.
The travel ban at the point of entry eliminated the new infections completely.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic is progressing at a much slower pace in Singapore than in other developed countries, through aggressive contact detection, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but without extreme restrictions such as forcibly closing restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from 28 March, but schools reopened on time on 23 March after the holidays.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic aggressively by contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantining, but by less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with more tests than deaths have a much lower case mortality rate, possibly because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column % of positive tests is affected by the testing policy of the country.
Similarly, a country where only those who are hospitalized are tested, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than a country where all citizens are tested, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands with the aim of removing dirt, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at "necessary moments" during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and diarrhea, which are transmitted through the fecal - faecal tract.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i. e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's nipple or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child using the toilet.
After spraying your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal fodder, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals from the hands that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important activity for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the rate of neonatal mortality in home births.
A 2013 study found that good hand washing exercises in children under five years old may slightly improve their height gain.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures to promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in cases of diarrhoea may be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as a self-induced behavior in homes, schools and communities worldwide is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of about 35 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, making a robust habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or treatment, which could reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo which is spread through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, layered skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the fecal transmission of disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, defecation), after cleaning the baby's nipples (after changing the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent transmission of disease are: before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the US had the moderate rate at 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several behavioral modification methods are now available to enhance handwashing behavior with soap at critical times. Mass handwashing by schoolchildren at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to instill the habit of handwashing in children's behavior.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large scale action to promote children's health and education.
The basic national programme includes daily fluoride cleaning, daily hand washing with soap, and anti - worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier in the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, adequate water flow helps in cleaning.
Due to repeated use, solid soap may contain residual bacteria from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to the washing of bacteria with foam.
Yet, according to the CDC, "soap with a liquid soap dropper on the palm without touching the hands is better".
Antimicrobial soaps have been promoted with emphasis for health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic - resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
So, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are advertised to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin protective agents, refined formulations may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) as pH regulators. A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soap containing bacteria is as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hands as consumer-grade soaps containing bacteria, trichlorous.
Hot water, comfortable for hand washing, is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
At body temperature (37 ° C) bacteria grow very rapidly.
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing soil and bacteria-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water - free base hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-water-free hand sanitizer agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated with glycerin in a gel, such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid), or a liquid or foam, such as a moisturizer, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The combination of hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi - drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccina, influenza and hepatitis) and parasites.
Alcoholic rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and kill 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria after 1 minute of application (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norvac) type viruses which are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and the fingertips of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these reagents is based on their ease of use and quick lethal activity to microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/ or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/ or other lubricants to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with lubricants significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Rarely allergic to alcohol or to the additives present in alcohol hand rubs are contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The lower tendency to induce irritating contact dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless reagents do not clean organic matter by hand, but simply disinfect it.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, because pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce effectiveness after repeated use due to possibly progressive adverse skin reactions, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or clay instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because still water basins can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Spray the hands with the appropriate amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and more germs are released when rubbed for longer periods.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can re - contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most frequently missed areas are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and the area under the nails.
Artificial nails and sticky nail polish can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from a hanging basin or a spigot with suitable holes and/or using ash, when needed. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions are available, such as "tippy-tap" and other low-cost options.
Tippy - tap is a simple technique using a rope - hanging jug, and a leg - operated lever, to pour a small amount of water over the hands and soapstick.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Large scale research shows that paper towels provide more hygiene than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the Paper Towel Industry The European Tissue Symposium, which aimed to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the palms of the fingers and 254% on the palms of the hands.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on the palms of the fingers and by 15% on the palms of the hands.
After washing hands and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the palms of the fingers and 77% on the palms of the hands. The scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying resulted in the ability to cross-contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which expels air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and unit and possibly contaminate the toilet environment up to 2 meters away from other toilet users.
The use of hot air hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0. 25 m from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the count of bacteria were observed after drying hands:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
During the journey, hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol based hand sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol content.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after the discovery of its effectiveness in preventing disease in the hospital environment by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the infection rate.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, with foaming using an appropriate amount of soap and water or gel and rubbing each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there is debris under the nails, a stiff hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being re - contaminated with those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent them from being transmitted.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical settings, non-washing remains at unacceptable levels, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, which leads to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection rates by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in healthcare settings.
The hand hygiene manual available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was done by Witby and others.
If the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required, commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has identified "five occasions" for hand washing:
after contact with blood/body fluid
before the disinfectant, and
After patient care. Adding disinfecting chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap) gives the hand washing agent a killing ability.
Such lethal capacity may be desirable before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To 'rub' one' s hands for surgical tears, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfected towels to dry hands after washing, and a disinfected brush for rubbing and another disinfected tool for undernail cleaning.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing the wrists from the hand to the elbow for 2 - 6 minutes.
No need to rub for long (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back on the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene came from 20% before washing, and little additional benefit was achieved when the frequency of hand hygiene was increased by more than 35%.
Washing hands with plain soap, more than triples the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rubbing with alcohol based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 minutes, it was found that rubbing hands with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs at reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile germs from hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems may include hand washing education for employees, increased availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an affordable, essential means of achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge to achieve universal handwashing practices.
For example, in most rural Africa, every private or public toilet has very few hand washing faucets, even though there are cheap alternatives to build hand washing stations.
However, the low rate of hand washing may be due to the habit of the person rather than the lack of soap or water.
The promotion and support of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and bring about long-term behavioural changes in the population.
For it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social outreach campaigns are less effective. An example of handwashing promotion in schools is the "Three Star Method" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap alongside other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the schools can go from one to three stars respectively.
The creation of hand washing stations can be part of hand washing promotion campaigns to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about a change in behaviour. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to prevention of DALYs.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two promoters of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, Englishman who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people believed that infections were caused by a bad smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as a critical method for preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "the right hand washing techniques" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and in airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands of" something means to declare your unwillingness to accept responsibility for it or to take part in it.
It derives from the Bible chapter of Matthew where Pontius Pilate had distanced himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very wide use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare 's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clear a fictional stain that reflects her guilty conscience about the crimes she has committed and about inducing her husband to commit them.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others after recalling or contemplating immoral acts, and attach more importance to hand washing devices.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" complementary activities such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapy water without hand washing is a part of the ceremonial hand washing described in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tevila and Netilat Yedayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing specifically to provide hygiene after certain actions.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands after using the toilet is mandatory.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash one's hands before and after every meal.
Control of risks of spreading COVID-19 infection in the workplace
Occupational safety and health methodologies for controlling hazards for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are applications of hazard controls for the control of hazards for the spread of COVID-19 infection in the workplace.
The appropriate control of the risk of disease spread in the workplace depends on the workplace and the work being done, which is based on risk assessments of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact hazard jobs involve minimal occupational contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay home if they are sick, observing respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate risk contact jobs are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population - density working environments, and some high - volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include: high-efficiency air filter filtration, use of sneez guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for the situation if a COVID-19 infected person is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and mortuary workers to be at high exposure risk who come into contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to a high exposure risk if personnel perform procedures that generate aerosols on, or collect or handle samples from, a COVID-19 infected or suspected person.
Hazard controls suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
The COVID-19 outbreak within the workplace can have multiple impacts.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible contact.
The nature of trade may change both in terms of what goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as at times of low demand or purchasing through delivery or mobile services).
Finally, movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparedness and response planning for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, and risk factors of individual personnel such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of an outbreak response include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the occupational community affects the responses adopted.
A hazard control sequence is a structure widely used to group hazard controls according to their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on personnel behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
All types of PPE should be selected for personnel based on hazard, appropriately fitted (e.g. respirators), worn consistently and properly, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact hazard jobs have minimal business contact with people and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging staff to stay home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquette covering cough and sneezing, tissue and garbage disposal, preparing remote or parallel shifts if necessary, discouraging staff from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Early identification and isolation of potentially contagious persons in the workplace is an important step to protect personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission occurring around the business location, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include staff who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density working environments, and some high volume sales arrangements. Installing high efficiency air filters in engineering controls for this and high risk groups, increasing the transmission rate, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing guards, and installing drive-through windows for customer service. Installing sick staff to stay at home in administrative controls for this and high risk groups, changing face-to-face meetings to virtual communications, establishing parallel sales, preventing unnecessary travel for customers to places with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency plans, including: providing staff with a platform for using face washing safety measures, providing staff with access to the latest training and training on COVID-19 safety practices, including wearing face masks and other tools that reduce the risk of exposure to the public, and providing staff with access to the latest and most up-to-date tools and tools that can reduce the need for people to wear face coverings or wear protective masks.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, designating a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue if coughing or sneezing.
Crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, potentially additional personal protective equipment should be worn.
Gloves and other consumables should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard controls include postponing travel if sick and self-isolation and immediately notifying the on-board medical center if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantined person's room. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building that is free of community transmission.
Since there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling meals at field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, paralleling arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to strategies to create social distancing. For law enforcement personnel performing daily law enforcement activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during capture, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reuse, and follow standard operating procedures for the insulation and disposal of used PPE and for the insulation and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health care and mortuary workers to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk contact tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if personnel perform aerosol generating procedures, collect or handle samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol generating procedures include duct penetration, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or sample collection from tears.
High-risk mortuary work involves people preparing the bodies of persons with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they do autopsy they become very high-risk. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during procedures that generate aerosols.
Specific negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in separate waiting zones, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who operate within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the US, NIOSH approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fitness-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, shorts and gloves.
If an aerosol generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only PPE needed for specific tasks, using the same respirator without removal during care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for non-diagnostic individuals.

This month, we are surrounded by extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that all human beings are interconnected and that we have responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must recognize that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community building, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we have seen among all our colleagues over emails, calls and chats is an extraordinary testament to how fortunate we have been to work with such extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you as my colleagues that I cannot express in words.
Last week, someone shared with me the praise of our work.
It reminded me how meaningful it is to turn the world to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful a symbol it is to keep this vital resource online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you're keeping the sites running or providing pay for our colleagues or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and it needs it more than ever.
This is a moment when both what we do, and how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work with you this coming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and to prepare a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed how we thought we would respond appropriately to the situation before us, and how best to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve the tension and support our mission for the long term.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with that.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work overtime, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you are caring for your loved ones, bringing groceries, or going to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not counting your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It doesn't need to be said, but we are saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work are seen.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please report to Brian at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can assist you and ensure that your situation is given appropriate attention by management.)
Hourly workers will get full pay.
We have said it before, and we are once again expressing our commitment to deliver on our promises to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his normal working hours during normal conditions.
You will get a salary even if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use their work as a way to escape the stress of the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We suggest that you talk to your manager so that we know what to expect, and then we can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we can't let stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and grant accumulation teams (and others) perform critical tasks that may require additional collaboration.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus our attention on collaborating on the things that are essential to our mission.
We all have so much to do, we will all just focus on the most necessary projects.
Slowing down now will save us from injury later.
There is no plan to double our time to recover after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that have gone beyond reality.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What will happen with APP?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we want to adjust the timeline for completing our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their critical work, care for themselves, care for loved ones, and adjust to those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of deadlines will bring a considerable reduction in our current planning workload and pressure across the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we have confirmation we will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office conditions, contacts, and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, taking great care, we deployed antiviral cleaning personnel to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface, the lobby, and the elevator bank that goes up to our floor with a hospital-grade anti-viral solution.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocol using products that assist the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be fully ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office had adopted a fully remote system in line with the guidance shared from San Francisco.
As some of our NYC colleagues know, there is also talk of leasing a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely from home for the first time.
Our longtime colleagues who work from home/remote know that this will require adjustments, and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to one or two hour increments at most.
And if long sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Clearly define meetings, have an agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video your default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and collaboration.
Take the initiative to facilitate each meeting, one person to monitor the chat for questions and keep track of the speaker list, and one person to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your health reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring webinar-based work efficiency guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community-funded clients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as the Editathon, until the WHO announces the end of the global pandemic.
We informed them that we understand that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be penalized for being forced to delay or amend those targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
This barrier causes a sense of sadness to the global community as a whole but also a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a place for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are in this together and are here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email, and all other relevant COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff residing in the significantly affected countries at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, programs, any major action stream, or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform CRT and work with them.
We are there to provide assistance and help in establishing relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please email Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a renunciation of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our work and responsibilities are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, deliver our activities with the support they need, and deliver the service the world depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Right now, it is time to help each other, and make room for the important work to come in the coming weeks and potentially the coming months.
To make this happen, we need all of you, and so we want you all to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 is a zinc - containing metaloenzyme located on the interstitial and other cell surfaces.
ACE2 protein contains the N - terminal peptide M2 domain and the C - terminal electrin renal amino acid carrier domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein with an unfolded enzyme-active domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the paraselline domain by another enzyme called Shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of lung type II airborne cells, enterocytes of small intestine, interstitial cells of arteries and veins and the soft muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE decomposes the angiotensin I hormone into the vasodilator angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes the carboxyl - terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1 - 7), (H - Asp - Arg - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - OH).
ACE2 can also break down many other peptides including [des-Arg9] - bradycainin, epelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been reported to play a role in heart attack.
As a parasitic protein, it serves as the main entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses, including ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-causing virus).
More specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 contak S1 proteins to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the activation of the S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that lowering the levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A methodological review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to controls".
Also, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in those with trauma and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less pronounced than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour course of action (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Insulated rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 Apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("Contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person, in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
In some regions and jurisdictions, many applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance.
Several frameworks have been developed for building contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems that are based on tracking the geolocation of app users.
A less intuitive option involves using a Bluetooth signal to log proximity to a user's other cell phone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has deployed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It's being used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contacts with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development, and would be available for scheduling within weeks. A similar app ("StopCovid") has also been planned in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if the app's use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple determined what types of organizations could include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
the monitoring must be 'legal, necessary and proportionate';
There should be a closing clause for the extension of supervision and monitoring;
Use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid promoting discrimination and disenfranchisement;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to abuse and to respond to abuse;
"Meaningful participation" by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and unauthorized groups, will be required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Gränegen) (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple scheme aims to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interpersonal communication (see section below).
A non-app based system was used to do contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
Apart from using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Several countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As on 6th April 2020, these details had not yet been released.
Privacy-protection contact tracing is a well-established concept with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly Contact Event Number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection technologies when collecting and using location or path intersection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
It builds on research from the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic". A similar effort is SafeTrace by privacy technology developer Enigma MPC, which was originally set up at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was established by groups organized in terms of essentially the same approach and broadly similar protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was a critical aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three stages:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracing apps.
Enable this functionality directly in iOS and Android
Drug reuse (also known as drug reuse, reprofiling, re-assignment or therapeutic change), is the reuse of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directives include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma injections related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides a proper project to develop effective antiviral drugs for protection from COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the papane-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain et al studied several candidate compounds, which were then adapted and analyzed for their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used for protection against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine will be among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of New York state's chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquyl phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's process of clinical trials and is authorized under EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir to be "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative for an average of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is limited and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of the antiviral lopinavir and a combination of ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir (Caletra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
Drugs were designed to block HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism within the scientific community about redirecting resources to the re-purpose of drugs being developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity trial.
Remdecivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdecivir had artificial peripheral antiviral activation for protection against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials run by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate disease and another for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (in Italy).
The state of New York began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Tigenese Alvesco (Cyclosodin), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with symptoms before they are infected with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients admitted from serious, hospitalized cases to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6000 adults aged 40 and above who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anti - scarring agents are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purposing of approved antiviral drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Trials also in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine for protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for protection from SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1 safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection from SARS-CoV-2.
As outlined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large scale planning and global availability.
In April, CEPI scientists informed that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the launch of 2020 to develop an effective vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
Advanced key platform targets in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been announced, but little public information is available (are being designed or envisaged in planning).
A phase I - II trial involves preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually conducted at random, placebo - controlled and multiple sites, determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose, and testing for vaccine efficacy for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre at the University of Saskatchewan (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, the Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanecke Schutemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Jansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the Oncogene Laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the vaccine synthesis and were starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a Generex subsidiary, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to develop a Li-Key peptide vaccine for protection against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, Western Maryland both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in the process of developing and manufacturing the vaccine.
will work closely with Novavax Inc.
The partners announced plans for preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 vectors, and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine, even on a short path.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is in laboratory research with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered Curavac "a large sum for the exclusive acquisition of a COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government objected to.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently in pre-clinical trials, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Taxis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and could begin trials on their final vaccine candidate by autumn.
On 19 March 2020 in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, which includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development US$29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI for the development of COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal trials of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures for protection from COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as MediCago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of other coronavirus outbreaks.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a trial of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines provided by MNA induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were apparently initiated 2 weeks after vaccination".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities, in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, pooled resources for the acquisition of supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have adverse effects, also called non - specific effects.
This means they may have benefits in addition to the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to enlist.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Preliminary research assessing vaccine effectiveness using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for biosecurity level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments for protection against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can be as long as two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms are mild, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread primarily between people during close contact, often through small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are produced when exhaling, they usually fall on the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a dirty surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasogastric duct.
It is recommended that masks be worn by people who suspect they are infected with the virus and by their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending their non-use, some recommending their use, and others making their use mandatory.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may become allergic or develop flu -like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking and bluing of the face or lips; seeking immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, only chest tightness and rapid beating were observed at first.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the period of development.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these antibody carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected who do not exhibit symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained allergenic during their stay in hospital.
China's National Health Commission began including allergenic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infections that day were allergenic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva may contain large amounts of viral.
Speaking out loud produces more drops than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can produce droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms came back positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubal penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause aerosols to form from respiratory secretions and thus airborne transmission.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although it is possible to spread before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, one person typically infects two to three other people. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for four hours.
Even then, it varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective if used correctly; soap products neutralize viruses by breaking down the fatty protective layer, as well as freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral content, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral content on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective sheath. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs from COVID-19 as the virus reaches the nutrient cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the lung type II air-cell cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "contact" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor diagnosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 have found radiation-induced airway damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing exogenous substances within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a trace for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to be correlated with selection of donor IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic foreign matter has also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples taken by the nasopharynx of a nasopharynx; however, a nasal nasal or mucous sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken at two week intervals and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that the purity is only 60 to 70%.
In the US, the FDA approved the first-care-of-site trial on 21 March 2020 for use later that month. Clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined ways to detect infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
In the initial transition, bilateral polygonal ground - glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common.
Subplural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the walls of the pelvis with variable air-cell fillers), and condensation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are limited data on microscopic lesions and disease physiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from autopsy are:
Macroscopy: swelling in the pulmonary envelope, pericarditis, thickening of the lungs and pulmonary sulphur
Viral pneumonia can be seen in four types of severity:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary swelling, pneumocytes overgrowth, large disproportionate pneumocytes, intercellular inflammation with lymphocytic interpolation and multicentric giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: radiation airway damage (DAD) with radiated airway leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: management of leaks and pulmonary space fibrosis in the air cavities
Blood: diffuse intervascular scaling (DIC); leukoerythroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings to limit transmission by immunocompromised individuals, in part. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure of infected individuals to large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, a critical part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "smoothing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating, and after spraying their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
In addition, it recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is generated by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used in alcohol to help kill bacterial germs; it is "not an active substance for hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and providing support to other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a plain face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supplemental treatment may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings, when aerosol generating procedures such as duct penetration or manual ventilation are performed.
For health workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the individual in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and ventilation precautions.
Recommended equipment is: PPE clothing, respirators or face masks, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are designed for protection against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy for a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non - approved experiments.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical convection or other alternatives, but a small percentage do.
Type of respiratory aid for persons with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized persons, with some evidence that duct penetration with high flow nasal penetration or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether either of these provides the same benefits to critically ill people is not known.
Some practitioners prefer to use intramuscular mechanical ventilation when available as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal ventilation. Serious cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the ability of a health system to handle the sudden increase in the number of sufficiently severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for labor, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have eventually been admitted to ICU.
Mechanical communication becomes more complex as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen supply becomes progressively more difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control systems and high PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of ventilator-related lung damage and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in trial-progress.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has provisionally authorized health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate threat to the person's life.
The necessary clinical studies have not been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analytics for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
This measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who come in contact with infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared joint phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galera said he has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kirsty Kaljulaid, made a global call for constructive solutions to stop the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of infection themselves.
"The increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and an economic downturn are the perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being", the BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying.
The disease may have a mild course with or without some symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or hypertensive illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at high risk of serious infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, pelvic trauma or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include dizziness, abnormal scaling and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scandial abnormalities, particularly prothrombin time increases, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group have abnormal renal function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate was 2.8% in men, while the mortality rate was 1.7% in women.
Tissue pathology examinations of autopsy lung samples show radiocommunication damage with cellular fibromycoid leaks in both lungs.
Viral cell degeneration was observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs appeared to be similar to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac damage was noted by high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the US March statistics, 89% of people admitted to hospital had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic status of a region can also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of mortality vary from situation to situation due to regional differences and systemic difficulties.
The mortality rate may be overestimated due to the low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung scans revealed organ damage.
It can also cause post intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as potential based on behaviour of other coronaviruses, but positive test cases for coronaviruses have been reported at a later date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse than a recurrent infection.
The virus is considered to be of an animal origin, spreading naturally and via infection from animal to human.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was given as 1 December 2019.
The official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease code U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Mortality-case ratio refers to the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of individuals diagnosed as dying from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of immunity can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the heart of the outbreak in Italy, in Castillon d'Aeda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among younger people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
Besides, the German health system is not extreme.
In the Netherlands, as assessed from blood donors, about 3% may be immune.
69 deaths (0.004% of population) have been confirmed from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown higher mortality rates among men.
The risk for men is highest in their 50s, and the gap between men and women only narrows at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact causes of this gender gap are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Sex-based immune differences, low prevalence of smoking in women, and the development of co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease, and 19 stands for the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31st December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), species of animals or group of people, which are consistent with international recommendations for naming with the aim of preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for acute respiratory disease virus and disease, which complies with 2015 guidelines not to use placenames in disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as nasal passages and parts of ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilation valves, and the supplier was unable to provide them within the required time frame, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Some humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hopes of effectiveness.
No vaccine is available at present, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactivated or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
Another strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system susceptible to certain subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-contact protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology of vaccine making).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been cited as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir in several countries scheduled to be reported by the end of April, most Chinese research is working on reusable antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Lopinavir/Ritonavir combined with Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the efficacy of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-approved use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, peer review of the research has been called for.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice as much is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection from COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required for suppression of the synthetic environment of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitasoxanoid has been recommended for further study in organisms after showing low concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial contact protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACE2 receptor.
There are major limitations to the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Osaltamivir does not inhibit the synthetic environment SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Increased cytokine levels can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytotoxin properties. Toquilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non-randomized trial nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In conjunction with a serum ferritin blood test to identify increased levels of cytokines, it aims to counteract such aggravated events, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA in 2017, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of a different cause, CAR T cell therapy induced steroid repressor cytokine release syndrome.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tossilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of pure and concentrated immunes produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral desensitization is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy may mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms, such as antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health-beneficial serum, which contains the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and has specific immunity to this virus, can be increased for rapid planning.
