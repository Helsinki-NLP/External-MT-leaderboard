Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases shows similar trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, confirming that although the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, states, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increased number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogenicity were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, a novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-CoV-2 associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that approximately 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 are mildly ill; that is, they have a respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 worsened to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% had a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in cumulative COVID-19 numbers in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has become increasingly geographically dispersed and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following the dynamics of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurviance, Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed European cases of COVID-19 according to the WHO's definition of the condition.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and the date in question, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, which are obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health in the countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compared them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day sporadic COVID-19 cases, and then the natural course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of cases reported from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy during the period between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases collected during a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom followed the trends of Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases started to rise on approximately 21 February, and then increased sharply on approximately 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was likely driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increases in cumulative COVID-19 numbers (supplementary article).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that in Italy for the period between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It is highlighted that as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already reported a total number of cases similar to that in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings suggest that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rising rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 numbers suggest that the pandemic is worsening at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, despite the different national public health responses, the possibility of different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients who should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy described the situation as almost 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, it needs to be collected in a systematic way to complement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010/11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the prevalence of COVID-19 cases that entered hospital with a risk of exceeding 90% of intensive care bed capacity, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since the cases collected so far are in specific regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve specific regional populations, information on cases and intensive care families is preferably provided at the level of the regional unit designation for the Census 2 (NTUS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals, and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid Risk Assessment, the rapid, comprehensive preventive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with the shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also accelerates public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is limited opportunity for countries to increase their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has killed more than 3,000 people and injured more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2, like its cousin SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to become infected with SARS in 2003, can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible and affects older people than younger people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics of the disease's epidemiology, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prognosis, and its prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eliminate the disease that threatens us.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memorial for all Chinese people who were urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday period and for many weeks afterwards due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease was named COVID-19.
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number one and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published covering the virology of the disease, its epidemiology, its causes, its diagnosis, and its treatment, since the first report was released on 7 January 2020 that identified the sequencing of the isolated virus through many patients.
This review aims to summarise the research progress in this new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by SARS, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We'll also discuss what we've learned so far about prevention and disease prediction, as well as some pressing questions that remain to be answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-fatal disease agents in humans, and have been the primary cause of approximately 15% of the common cold.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries at a terrifying rate of spread and deaths.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronavirus in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported by Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, counties, and countries.
On 20 January, cases of infection among health care providers were reported, indicating the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan was shut down with all public transportation suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases of infection, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the onset of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and some 50 other countries around the world (Figure (Figure 2)).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final extent of the outbreak and its severity has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more updated description of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has affected people of all age groups, but it has primarily affected people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half of the infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31 per 100,000) than women (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 has spread between groups in and around Hubei mainly.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (BRC) was 3.77 (95% confidence interval: 3.51-4.05), and the modified baseline reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected is increasing exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the heavy travel operations ahead of China's Spring Festival.
The case-confirmed mortality rate was 1.44% (95% confidence range: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted per-patient mortality rate was 3.06% (95% confidence range: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a family of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single ribosomal DNA sequence.
They can be divided into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and both alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The S-enveloped forks of the sugar protein bind to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and di-petydeyl peptidase 4 (DPB4), to Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral ribose DNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the ribose DNA accompanied by glycoproteins and membrane proteins forms ferrion-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% among 10 sequence-tested samples collected from the original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Transmission electron microscopy revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is less strongly bound to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a short, novel protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have any known range or pattern of function.
On 18 February 2020, Chow et al reported the full-length structure of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 under the supercooled electron microscope with a resolution of 2.9 Å within a compound with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind to protein S, providing a clue to coronavirus identification and infection.
Sodium-based neutral amino acid transporters may become a therapeutic target for drug screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host .
Both Sars-Kow and Mers-Kow are known to have originated from bats and been transmitted to humans via the zebra and camel, respectively.
By comparing the sequence evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus identical to the SARS-like coronaviruses from bats by 96% and named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be elucidated.
Ji and others suggested that the snakes carried the virus from bats to humans, which involved a symmetrical recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that hornworms - long-tongued, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the likely intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic similarity of the coronavirus detected in hornworms and in SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread over two genomes is still a significant difference; therefore, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of Sars-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at below 20 degrees Celsius and humidity between 40 and 50 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore is more susceptible to the emerging virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies related to other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4) 4).
Generally, after a virus invades the host, it is recognized by the normal immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) including the C-type lectin-like receptor, the Toll-like receptor (TLR), the nucleotide-linked lipid domain-like receptor (NLR), and the RIG-I protein-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory agents, the maturation of the branched cells, and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large phagocytes of the viral antibodies.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus evade immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the battle against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T cell function by inducing T cell programmed death.
Hybrid immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, are also essential in the fight against viral infection.
For example, I neutralized isolated antibodies from a recovered MERS-Cov patient.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario, multi-organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is impaired to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as shown above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most recent incubation period, and thus prevent people who are infected but not experiencing symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus are typically asked to undergo a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, and may be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have progressed rapidly to suffer from acute respiratory syndrome, traumatic encephalomyelitis, acid reflux, and atherosclerosis.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without undergoing imaging for pulmonary abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, 3% for diarrhea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group infected by a person who did not show symptoms.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-Cov patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory support much more than COVID-19 patients and they were consistent with a higher MERS mortality rate from COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and strep throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and strep throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and respiratory support was required in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% while the number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
By comparison, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the baseline reproduction number of Sars-Cov-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the baseline reproduction number of Sars-Cov ranged only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproduction figure is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
So, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of disease in conglomerates often occurs in the same family or from the same conglomerate or the same vessel, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel to, staying in, or having been in contact with Wuhan or other affected areas or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without developing symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovered patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending a warning for increased quarantine time.
Patients have normal or low peripheral white blood cell (LBC) counts in the early stage.
For example, lymphocyte deficiency with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L including lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, and elevated levels of the transporter aminospartate and blood sputum were detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and most patients had elevated C-reactive protein and red cell aggregation.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, which is produced by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, is elevated, and the number of lymphocytes is gradually reduced.
Abnormalities in radiography are seen in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-grey shadows or a sorted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients sometimes suffer from atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive thrombosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type 1 and type 2 lung cell dysfunction reduces the level of superficial stimulant and increases the surface tension, which, in turn, reduces the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst chest X-ray results are often compared to the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pulmonary cell exfoliation, hyaline formation, cellular lymphocytic rupture, and polymorphocytic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to what happens in patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribose DNA by the polymerase chain reaction for transcription (PT-PCR) has been used as a key criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, the use of clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which are no longer individually based on RT-PCR) was introduced in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, the clinical manifestations, the laboratory tests, and the findings of the radiography are essential and essential to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based Sherlock technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which detects a fragment of the created ribosome DNA of SARS-CoV-2 at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microl of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without the need for precise instruments.
We hope that the new technology can improve sensitivity and convenience dramatically if it is validated in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of expertise with the emerging coronavirus, physicians are able to provide supportive care primarily to COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even the plasma from the recovered patients was recommended for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other organs that release the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-respiratory and respiratory ventilators, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and traumatic injuries, and protecting vital organ functions are also considered essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine storm is known to be caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute cases.
Activating hormones, tucylizumab, and a single-celled antibody, interleukin 6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; kinase kinase inhibition; Blinatumumab; cytokine 4 signal suppression; and histone deacetylase inhibitors.
Antibiotics and immunosuppressants have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in higher doses were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it caused severe side effects, particularly osteoporosis, which severely affected the prognosis of the disease.
However, the use of short courses of activating hormones in low to moderate doses has been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral therapy has been confirmed to be effective.
However, it was found that giving remdesivir, a nucleated analogue, intravenously was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these viruses, Gilly Gad has brought the compound to China for some testing on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, parisetinb, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after blobenavir/ ritonavir combination therapy.
Interactions with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and generating antibodies .
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IGs) produced by B-cell lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and directly challenge the unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients in critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation, viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to put this method to widespread use before specific treatments are developed.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an overstimulatory immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxic.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of patients with critical conditions.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, isolating stem cells from recovering patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode the active antibodies, or screening for antibodies that are active against the virus's core proteins, is more critical and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are highly dependent on a combination of multiple components in a composition that varies with the diagnosis based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or unknown, and it is difficult to extract and verify these ingredients or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the efficacy of the Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 has been discovered.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM only with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very rough comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their condition must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Zhang and co-workers published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine combined.
They found that the time needed to recover from high body temperature, symptom reduction, and hospital stay was much shorter in the Western medicine plus traditional Chinese medicine treatment group compared to the Western medicine treatment group alone.
Most impressively, the rate of symptom aggravation (ranging from mild to severe) was much lower in the Western medicine + TCM treatment group compared to the Western medicine only treatment group (7.4% vs 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western medicine + TCM treatment group compared to the Western medicine only treatment group (8.8% vs 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await further well-researched trials on a larger scale and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and to explain the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel a strong fear of a highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by hormonal stimulation, can lead to further anxiety and mental disturbance.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric illnesses were reported including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delusions, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and being on the list with their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear points of contact with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from infected animal and human stocks to susceptible hosts are necessary and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against emerging epidemics.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate long-lasting, effective, neutral antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in vivo in older, lethal challenge models and in their protection from infection with an animal-source virus was not determined before clinical trials began.
This may be because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, isolated cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions because of the continued presence of animal sources in the infected areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS have been developed using inactivated virus, deoxygenated RNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of the author protein, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge due to the length of time (average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamics of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishment.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of disease spread and death in severe cases.
Therefore, building a disease outcome prediction model is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect prognosis in COVID-19 patients or associated patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the progression of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The age groups 30 to 65 years were primarily affected by COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require it (at an average age of 66 versus 51), indicating age as a predictor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as shown above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are at greater risk of suffering from acute cardiac injury and cardiac arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile duct cells with the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which may lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly linked and may overlap.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and is suggested to be a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The association between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 and the prognosis of its course has also been suggested.
In addition to this, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransporter (AST), alanine aminotransporter (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So, they're classic signs of dysfunctional heart or liver.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other problems to predict the outcome of COVID-19 and its complications.
Use of stimulants: As discussed above, stimulants are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the widespread use of high-dose ACE hormones in SARS patients, many ALS survivors have suffered with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, severe uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients are in a severe illness, whereas most transmission of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
So, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much harder and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
A number of efforts are currently underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have hurt the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase-out will last for three to four months.
However, some other experts do not have the same amount of optimism.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have created a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-dorsal and laryngeal scans of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like chronic outbreak.
However, there have been promising signs in China based on the declining number of new cases, which suggests that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled through strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 becomes less infectious and eventually goes extinct or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the SARS and MERS COVID-19 epidemics is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, raising a new possibility of transmission from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, great precautions need to be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passers-by who have been in contact with sick or infected people.
Wearing a face mask is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from being passed through the air or adhering to surfaces where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860s) can protect from inhalation of ferrions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of ferrions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 and each is approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks that are stacked together, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation suits to further reduce exposure to the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face protection or goggles when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more than usual, and try to stay at home to self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered the proper distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have caused a state of high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020 that the emerging virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human replication and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced the public's alertness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time was lost to contain the disease in its lowest reach in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may learn from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be (1) more cautious when releasing public statements because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more proactive in releasing targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of epidemics and test and periodically improve the community's response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
It spread in less than two months throughout China and some 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar to those of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger ones and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older individuals than in younger ones.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become infected again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the detection of 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-CoVs in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What was the intermediate animal species that transmitted the virus from the original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to my 1 and 2, we can't stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak could come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells secreting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve as it travels between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, or will it disappear like SARS, or come back periodically like influenza?
It is necessary but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal origins of the human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two types of human coronaviruses were known to cause a mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has brought the other face to the fore to reveal just how serious and life-threatening infection with human coronaviruses can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought the coronavirus back into the spotlight, surprising us with its rapid spread but with a capacity to cause disease compared to its sibling SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is an animal-derived disease, so understanding the animal origins of human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
Intermediate storage hosts have also been identified for some human coronaviruses.
Identifying host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Investigating the interactive relationships between coronaviruses and the host in animals also provides important insight into the origin of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the available information about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the date of their discovery as well as their animal origins and transmissions between species.
Most importantly, we compare and differentiate between different human coronaviruses from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements of successful host switching and the impact of complications of viral evolution on disease severity.
Coronaviruses (coronaviruses) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which comprise a group of single-stranded ribose DNA-enveloped viruses.
These viruses have the largest genome of any ribosomal DNA virus at 26 to 32 kilobases and are called "crown viruses" because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, coronaviruses have unfragmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the two replicate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, denoted nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading molds for structural proteins, including the S-spike, E-shell, M-membrane, and N-nucleoproteins.
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (coronavirus alpha, coronavirus beta, coronavirus gamma, coronavirus delta), including the beta coronavirus types that comprise most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, F, W).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic origin for most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the main repository for gamma and delta coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have continually transcended species barriers and some have emerged as the cause of serious human diseases.
Seven human coronaviruses are known so far.
They include human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-NL63 and they belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta coronaviruses include human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a cold or diarrhea or both.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
It was isolated from human coronavirus-229E, strain one B814, from nasal secretions of patients with colds in the mid-1960s.
Much information has since been collected through extensive studies conducted on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which spontaneously heal their symptoms.
In fact, it was a widely accepted concept that infection with human coronaviruses was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is among the deadliest in modern history, infecting 8,000 people with a fatality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, MERS is a modern epidemic that has been steady in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 human coronavirus (HCV), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current pandemic, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have an animal origin from bats, or mice, or pets.
Multiple lines of evidence support the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the zoological origins of human coronaviruses has provided a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate host and amplified host animal (amplified hosts) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future repercussions.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, transmissions between species, and the causes of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the commonly held belief that the original HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after translocation between species to a new host.
We will also review the assessment of the path of the HCoV as it is often accompanied by an increase in its transmissibility and a decrease in the severity of disease.
We also discussed in this context the implications of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of human coronavirus-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with colds, different types of coronaviruses were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the dates of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and instructive.
The first strain of human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and subsequently adapted to live in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, nausea, and sore throat, with fever and cough in approximately 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and was subsequently transmitted into the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of human coronavirus OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by human coronavirus 229E, which are not symptomatically distinguishable from infections with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are most likely to be transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, infection with HCoV-229E caused mild colds in healthy individuals.
Only a few patients with severe immune deficiency showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as non-tuberculous pneumonia, is the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the hypercarrier, it has been estimated that a single case of infection can lead to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load appearing on day 10 of illness.
The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 start with muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea, and chills, followed by late symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory distress.
Anemia, impaired liver function, and elevated creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Also observed in SARS patients is widespread damage to the spleen, epithelial proliferation, and increased phloem cell counts.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients will then need intensive care and ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases several organs including the digestive tract, liver and kidneys can also be affected and are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be particularly deadly in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a huge effort has been made to conduct research on the human coronavirus.
Human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and HIV patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample of an 8-month-old infant with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that human coronavirus NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with its peak occurrence during early summer, spring, and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with strep throat, also known as asphyxia.
In the same year, human coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
Human coronavirus HKU1 has been found to be globally distributed, causing mild respiratory illness, similar to human coronavirus NL63, human coronavirus 229E, and human coronavirus OC43.
All four of these community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause high-prevalence diseases, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, when coronaviruses gain this ability to efficiently and continuously self-perpetuate within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia of imported cases and rare secondary transmission to contacts in close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, and are characterized by acute exacerbated pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS also suffered severe kidney failure, which distinguishes MERS from other human coronavirus-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
During mid- to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia later identified as being caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The current outbreak of lower respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV-2 has been declared by the World Health Organization as a public health emergency of international concern, and termed COVID-19.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in Hubei province of China is 4.2% while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some patients.
Pneumonia is the most serious symptom and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology in the nucleotide sequence of 82%, they belong to different branches in the lineage tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been reports of people who are asymptomatic despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and these may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences of great significance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in incubation and in the time period of disease.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms falls between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e., human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits symptoms that are more common in community-acquired human coronaviruses, including the appearance of unspecified, mild, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in SARS-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission exhibits interesting patterns of both community-acquired and SARS-CoV human coronaviruses.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are needed in the future to clarify whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the anthro-oral route plays a role as important as SARS-CoV, at least in some cases.
It is of interest whether SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit seasonal prevalence as in community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including the potential for transmission, the mechanism of disease and the sustained spread after transmission to humans will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired, mildly symptomatic human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient H.I.V. pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe human disease have been eliminated, as have humans who have had severe human coronavirus disease.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans sufficiently to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face the host's limiting factors.
And by that logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop human-to-human transmission through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses spread among human populations over many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses don't need a pet warehouse.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the two most common causes of severe disease, did not adapt well to humans, and could not continue to be transmitted between humans.
They need to stay in their animal enclosures and breed there and then look for the right opportunity to move on to more vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more of the medium and enlarged hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired by society.
It's highly contagious like human community-acquired coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it causes more disease than community-acquired HCoVs and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether they will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or an intermediate animal host is not yet clear.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for the HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor virus and shares high similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
The original virus is usually well adapted and not causing infection to the host.
Similarly, the host-depository continuously harbors the human coronavirus over a long period of time.
In both cases, the hosts naturally infect and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV enters the intermediate host recently before or near its attack on humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes disease.
This intermediate host can act as a bio-source for human infection and also acts as an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit to humans to expand the range of human-to-human infection.
Human coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to an intermediate host, so that they may colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first SARS case had a history of contact with the prey.
The viral prevalence surveys then indicated that the animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm frog (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs at live-animal markets were first reported to carry SARS-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after all the feral cats in the markets had been killed.
However, it has been reported that the result of a SARS-CoV test in a masked palm frog living in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, indicating that the masked palm frog may be only an amplified host intermediate, but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Noting that as 80% of the various animals in Guanzhou markets had antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of a large SARS-CoV mediator host is not excluded.
It looks like all these are non-transmitting Sars-Cov hosts.
Research on the natural animal host of Sars-Kov later led to the discovery of a closely related bat corona virus, called Chinese yellow-horse-snout bat virus HKU3, which is found in Chinese horse-snout bats.
SARS-CoV antibody testing in these bats and the sequencing of the Chinese yellow-horse bat virus genome associated with acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 were positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SAV-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none of them could be isolated as a live virus except for WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is known as a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extracted from bat feces was shown to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in bats, zebras, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of the recovering patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to mimic WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related SARS-CoV ancestor in bats, as they share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not direct host hosts of SARS-CoV.
The analysis combines the evolution of the MERS-CoV strains in the bat corona-HKU4 group and the bat corona-HKU5 group itself.
The coronavirus-HKU4 in bats uses its own MERS-CoV receptor, di-peptideylpeptidase4 (di-peptideylpeptidase4), to enter the virus.
The MERS-CoV RNA-based polymerase DNA-ribose sequences are evolutionarily more similar to its beta-coronaviruses counterparts in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
Merse-Cov has not yet been discovered to live in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and HKU25 in its closest bat share only 87% similarity in nucleotide sequences.
Thus, the bat may not be the direct host of Meers-Kov.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels of single-sex camel are seropositive to the MERS-CoV antibody, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
MERS-CoV matched virus in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of camels, indicating that camels play the role of the original host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms generally appeared in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV, but a high viral prevalence was observed.
Infected camels were noticeably spreading the virus not only through respiration but also through the oral rectal route, which is the primary route for the virus to spread from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, and these cases are logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving animal species not identified in the MERS-CoV containment.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RaTG13 in isolates from horseshoe bats shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homology.
The sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine paternity, as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host (s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless bat coronaviruses are found to be nearly identical in the future.
The intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be among the wild animal species sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood market, which has been associated with many initial COVID-19 cases, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as the anteater (Manis javanica) could also harbor the ancestral coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this and the SARS-CoV-2 ant-eating coronaviruses share nucleotide sequences of 85-92%.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the nucleotide sequence level.
Two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 viruses are grouped in the lineage evolution tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence matching of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 differ significantly from RaTG13, although the overall genome sequence is more similar.
A previous study on an infected hornet's nest also revealed viral organisms in lung samples, and they were similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various assembly methods and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of approximately 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the archer ant eater is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the harvesting ants are the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronaviruses in harvesting ants.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronaviruses in the marsupial anteater.
The evolutionary pathway for SARS-CoV-2 in bats, carnivorous ants, and other mammals is still being determined.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV-2 and the arthropod ant, the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology for whole genome sequencing.
It is hypothesized that the high degree of similarity between the binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the parasitic ante-mortem of the beta-coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
There is a counter-proposal that suggests the re-assembly of SARS-CoV-2 in the scavenger ant-eating beta-coronavirus and RaTG13 in wild animal species III.
Rearrangement is widely prevalent among beta coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct zoological origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence of strain evolution has suggested that both human coronaviruses NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 were found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Highlands coronavirus) detected in North American Tricolored bats has been reported to be closely related to human coronavirus NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was found to be genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and was suspected to be hosted by the medium.
For clarity, current information on animal origins of known human coronaviruses has been summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of the evolution of lineages has provided evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection epidemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species remains less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses have been discovered in bats closely related to human coronavirus-229E.
They have the alpha coronavirus in Alaska.
There is ample evidence to support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have a relationship with bats in a shared ecological habitat.
Humans have a close relationship with the Alpaca.
Second, the HCoV-229E belonging to the bat-like alpha coronaviruses is multi-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca-like coronavirus causes outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca-associated coronavirus alpha has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that the alpaca has been infected with human coronavirus 229E belonging to the human coronavirus alpha cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats could transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
While alpha coronaviruses in bats act as assemblers of HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and camel monkeys may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as they do in Myres-Cov.
Myres Cove provides an excellent example of transition between species, from bats to the camel-only sunbird and from the camel-only sunbird to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the Mers-Cov bat has been known since the beginning of its identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent findings.
Clearly, bats provide a rich pool of virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments within one species and their transmission between species.
Bats' longevity, living in crowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying ability all provide favorable conditions for them to be ideal virus distributors.
Meers-Koeff, on the other hand, has moved to the only beauty sleep over decades.
It has adapted well to this camel until it has transformed from a medium host into a natural and stable host.
Mers-Cov causes very little disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent transfer to humans remains accidental and humans are a non-transmissive host for MERS-CoV where its transfer cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of scavenger ants, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta-coronaviruses associated with the ant-eaters of the harvest ant are very ill.
They may be non-transmitting hosts for SARS-CoV-2 belonging to beta-coronaviruses, similar to the actin in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies will determine many of the possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans by either proving or excluding it.
First, bats may be host-causing for a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share an ecosystem through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the carnivorous ant could be one of the medium-sized hosts of the recently discovered COVID-2 virus.
Humans get infected by slaughtering and eating game.
Many mammals including pets are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is justification for doing antibody scans in pets and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, a reassortment of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with bats and carnivorous ants.
The search for the zoonotic origin of SARS-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different species of animal hosts, from the viral aspect there are three main factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, they have relatively high mutation rates in ribose DNA replication.
Mutation rates of estimated coronaviruses, compared to other single-stranded ribosomal DNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average mutation rate of ~10-4 mutations per year for Locality 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of coronaviruses to new hosts.
Coronaviruses contain an externally corrected ribonuclease enzyme, which results in its deletion leading to extremely high mutability and attenuation or inability to evolve.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue drug Remdesivir is known for its ability to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses by inhibition of the extrinsic ribonuclease enzyme and RNA-based ribose DNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of coronavirus mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of host females.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It appears to have already adapted to another near-human host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to camel-only disease.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift would help vaccines and antiviral drugs to resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its efficacy.
Second, the RNA-rich DNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional timing for genome editing and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which is useful for the emergence of new coronaviruses when the conditions become suitable.
This is supported by the unique abundant open reading patterns and protein functions encoded near the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses swap patterns randomly and repeatedly during replication of RNA through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host such as a mixing vessel, sequence switching occurs repeatedly during the replication of the coronavirus's ribose DNA.
Highly homologous full-length ribosomal DNA and secondary genomes may be reassembled to generate new coronaviruses.
Specific evidence of strain evolution for natural recombination has been discovered in HKU1 and HKU43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as ACS-like coronaviruses in bats and HKU9 in bats.
The virus interacts with the host associated with the transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing transition between species.
In this regard, we take the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also showed evidence for positive selection during interspecies transition events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and the wild cat, it was thought that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations that occur in the binding domain of S-protein receptors.
In general, the S-protein receptor binding domain of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is highly selective by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain occurs in the 318 to 510 amino acids in the S1 segment, which binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in addition to the helper receptors for entering the virus.
The receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV is able to recognize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2A receptors in various animals, including bats, feral cats, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were detected that were different from the viral isolates from humans and wildcats in the receptor binding domain, and 4 of them are in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2.
The K479N and S487T mutations are found in the binding domain of the Sars-Kov receptor in the wild boar, which could increase the likelihood of a protein spike reaction in the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S, implying that the potential for binding protein S in the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has changed.
Indeed, a study with supercooled electron microscopy indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this binding than that between the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and the S-protein in SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to determine if any other type of auxiliary receptors may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, the human coronavirus NL63 is also associated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as the N protein analyte for human coronavirus-229E, and the 9-O-isobutyl sialic acid for human coronavirus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transition between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the interspecies transmission outcome of HCoVs is also subject to other factors controlling host dependency and limitations.
The bifurcation of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, such as bats, camels, monotremes, and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to control host dependence factors and weaken inward restriction factors to implement successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular markers in this critical space for the virus's interaction with the host remain detectable and characterizing.
The genome-wide unbiased screening can be used to investigate host dependencies and limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of the human coronaviruses: back to square one
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers ample opportunities for the emergence of novel human coronaviruses.
And by that logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoVs, and are two important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes involves the ability to modify viral phenotypes to a great extent.
Among the regulatory proteins for SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV associated with viruses was isolated in bats but was found to encode distinct ORF8 proteins.
It turns out that all 29 of Sars-Cov's nucleotide deletion properties were present in isolated strains at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion led to the split of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV is characterized by a history of possible recombination through the alpha and gamma strains of coronaviruses, where a large number of small recombination regions have been identified in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Reassembly sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has seen cases of cross-breeding, which occurred in the only camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of recombination have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from viruses' ridding themselves of selective stresses, such as that caused by the host's immune system.
The loss of a full-length ORF4 protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although a healthy ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses that are related to HCoV-229E, the ALV virus exhibits a single nucleotide seam, which leads to a castration frame mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Only asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been detected when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating cross-adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bat have been shown to be appropriately adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the weak activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats reduced the potency of the pathogens that coronaviruses cause.
In addition, the activity of the SLC in bats was suppressed by an increase in the rate of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitory SLC receptor and a decreased expression level of the major tissue compatibility class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from the increased metabolic activity of bats can lead to both inhibition of the replication of the coronavirus and the effect of patching by the exogenous ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when infecting a new host.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features to adapt to the host.
So it's not a coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in host hosts such as bats and camels.
They reproduce vigorously without eliciting a strong immune response from the host.
Here lie the secrets that explain why asymptomatic carriers of the virus are seen and the causes of acute cases in human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separate from the replication of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy for immune response isolation may have useful implications in antiretroviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, intake of interferon type I can be of benefit at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, activation of the inflammatory particle keratopyrin NLRP3 in bats is weak.
In this reasoning, inhibition of the inflammatory particle C. NLRP3 using the MCC950 inhibitor is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While bat beta-CoVs were found to share SARS-CoV in 95% nucleotide homology, there were also bat coronaviruses that shared 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While wild cats and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, they have not detected intermediate direct hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-coronaviruses have been discovered in the anthrax of the carnivorous ants that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the carnivorous ants may have been one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-coronaviruses in the carnivorous ants contributed a genetic section that led to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that Sars-Kov-2 was man-made either intentionally or by accident.
Coronaviruses have come back into the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of animal disease origins and animal reservoirs for human coronaviruses in transmission to humans.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV originated from human-to-cat contact in markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the killing of wild cats was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
The same logic, that the scavenger animals should be disposed of from fresh produce markets to prevent the transmission of animal-origin disease, is in light of the discovery of multiple strains of beta-coronaviruses in scavenger ants that closely resemble SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, and also whatever its transmission method, through anteaters and other mammals remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
Meers-Koev, on the other hand, has been in the single camel's nest for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local citizens.
It's widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice all beauty to control MERS, as officials at China's wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a holistic approach to the development of effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in addition to other infection control measures, should be adopted.
Failing to eradicate these viruses permanently, new genetic patterns may emerge and cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases originating in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses in bats are highly diversified, potentially causing diseases of animal origin.
There is a lot of opportunity for the emergence and recombination of coronaviruses associated with animal-origin diseases, which leads to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In light of the plight of humanity due to SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact that so many viruses have taken their place on the planet for so long.
They live in their own natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread and reproduce.
Although bats have many characteristics that promote the spread of viruses, human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which is proving useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-borne viral diseases is to move humans away from the natural reservoirs of animal-borne viruses.
The mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit the original SARS-CoV-2 virus to the ant-eating squid, it is important to know what conditions have been created for bats and ant-eating squid to share a similar ecological environment.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way humans come into contact with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal is the true mediator host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and the sea-eating ants.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, a field ant eater, or another mammal, it is expected to identify SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor viruses that are nearly identical to their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will uncover the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with implications for important measures to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the criteria for "necessary suspected" and "confirmed" when diagnosing COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection, which introduced our experience and included relevant reference information for the global pandemic response.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; and so diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and introduced the newest diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (RNV-2019) officially became known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and was named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick guideline and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
It's received a lot of attention since it was published.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; and so diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn) has issued a total of seven versions of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Manual between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some contexts changed substantially.
Now our guidance guidance has been commented on by Zhou and others, who have made a simple suggestion for monitoring scores based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added new guidance to our guidance and have also become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their great efforts and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (trial version 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case requires combining any one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history and two of the clinical manifestation elements to reach a comprehensive analysis, or requires verifying three elements of the clinical manifestation elements in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel to, or residence in, Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported, during the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive DNA test results); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported, during the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with the community of acute cases (2 or more cases of fever/infection and respiratory symptoms occurred at home or other small areas, such as the office or the hospital); or (2) history of contact with other persons who have had no symptoms, such as children or children.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics as demonstrated by imaging for COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal level, low, or low lymph count in the early stage of infection.
Diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case involving any of the following elements: (1) positive real-time PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogeneity of the whole viral genome sequence with known characteristics of the newly identified coronaviruses; (3) positive IgM antibody and SARS-CoV-2 G antibody test results in the serum; or IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 changing from negative to positive, or a calibration elevation at a level equal to or greater than 4 levels above that level in the acute phase.
We see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for respiratory tract DNA or blood samples has been added to version II (January 18, 2020) and III (January 22, 2020).
Pathogen detection in blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then the Serum Interactions Manual was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications have relied on the ongoing work of researchers to arrive at the design of an ideal toolkit for DNA detection for rapid diagnosis, plus respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of positive antibody result to confirmed case standards.
Besides, there is growing evidence that we need to be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and asymptomatic conditions.
So, the content of the flow chart for Cho and others should be updated, where they classified the person as asymptomatic as "low risk".
The score monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to gain access to more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we call for the most up-to-date guidance from the countries of origin of persons to be followed and adhered to.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest daily rate
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
That's the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, the number of registered infected cases was 114 active cases and 33 recoveries were in residence.
17 deaths have been recorded.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjad Sabrina Flora, stated at an online press conference that the death cases included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadhi, there were two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saif Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitreya Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaid Al-Kader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport will be shut down for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The public transport disruption initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic goods is still allowed, namely: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March, two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
All three were already healed by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has surpassed 2 million worldwide.
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday showed that the total number of cases of the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus cases, and the first associated death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization announced 105,1635 confirmed cases, as of yesterday, of which 79332 cases were in the 24 hours prior to 10 am CET (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, associated with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 deaths in the United States were reported on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, announced on Thursday that the city is being extended until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the payment of salaries to Russians without going to work will continue until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes in favor, 10 abstentions, and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in Mecca and Medina to become an all-day curfew; previously it was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. only.
Thailand intends to impose a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
The governor of Ohio, Mr. Mike DeWayne, announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1st.
Australian shops are reducing toilet paper limits for every transaction.
Australian retail chains Wallworths and Coles tightened their toilet paper purchase restrictions on Saturday and Sunday evenings to reduce them to two Walworths and one Coles per transaction across all branches nationwide.
I also set Aldi's stores for one mile, and that's Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at checkout points in chain stores and on their Facebook pages.
Reports have said that buyers have put them in storage due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
Wal-Worts on Wednesday announced a limit on delivering toilet paper to homes to one roll per order.
These changes followed previous restrictions passed by Wal-Worth on 4 March and Coles on 5 March to allow only four wrappers to be purchased per transaction.
Coles stores reported in their March 8 press release that despite the four-wrap restrictions, "many stores are still selling out within one hour of receiving it", describing the demand as "unprecedented", as well as Aldi stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as "unexpected".
Sales have "increased substantially" in the past week, according to a spokesman for Wal-Worts.
As Costco in Canberra set last week, the amount of food allowed to be bought is two rolls.
To ease the shortage, Coles' stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery times, and Wallsworth's requested additional stock, while Aldi's made its stock available for special shows scheduled for early Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery times are making it difficult.
Production costs are expected to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with little special supply.
On Tuesday, Aldi Stores announced that due to the early availability of stock, some stores will not be able to provide Wednesday's special offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported to News.com.au that stores are filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the quantity of stock in terms of numbers, and when sold out, it leaves large empty shelves, which promotes a sense of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman, as reported by ABC News, stated: "Cools and Wal-Mart have the view [that] if there are more products on the shelves, if you can buy products like toilet paper and sterilizers and get them in bulk, it might reduce the panic".
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that it was out of stock.
According to a report from News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Clink's toilet paper, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorbent, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue to supply their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers are giving away free toilet paper to the first bidder in Melbourne auctions, while fewer auctions were held due to buyers going on a long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of N.T. News, a daily newspaper in Darwin, included eight pages of advertising folding that could be cut up and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially hesitant about imposing restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on 3 March; the stores stated that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including commas, sterilizers, dried goods, hand sanitizers and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, a British online store called Okado was observed to list the purchases of toilet paper Andris in twelve-roll lots.
The WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome and known as SARS-CoV-2 - has reached pandemic proportions.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease, not the severity of individual cases, the WHO has called for governments to take action:
"All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "If countries can detect and screen people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize them for the confrontation".
"We are all very concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence and risk as well as the alarming levels of inaction".
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "No other respiratory virus has been traced from its initial emergence to sustained global spread, other than influenza".
Gebreus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never had a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
He continued, "We've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new situation is being described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Regarding the outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said: "The bottom line is that things are going to get worse".
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated to be 4%, while globally it ranged between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for the virus.
Primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, monitoring, and self-isolation for suspected infection.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by a buying spree.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
There has been widespread misinformation about the virus online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin, and other areas where there have been high cases of the virus.
As a result of the reduction of travel and the closure of heavy industries, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and began investigating in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, so the virus is believed to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in scavenger ants, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person to show symptoms was infected on 1 December 2019, and that this person had no apparent contact with the wet market population that was later discovered.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dated 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although the number of new cases in China reported was down, it had risen sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases within it for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with adults aged 19 years and younger accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, has estimated that 60% of Britons need to be infected before effective herd immunisation can be carried out.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies that do not test for only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases were undetected in China, as of 23 January, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis estimate published on 30 March indicated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from worsening symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 has caused approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of 5 February were concentrated in those over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested - for example, at home, in a nursing home, and so on.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States acknowledged "we know that [the number of deaths reported] reflects an estimate that is less than the reality", a statement supported by narrative reports that point to the inaccuracy of the count in the United States. Such type of underestimation occurs in pandemic cases; such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to injuries reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-infection ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the fatality rate from infections have decreased from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people who died from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (FR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (confirmed and unconfirmed) who die from the disease.
These statistics have no time frame and track a specific population from infection to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Evidence-Based Medicine Centre at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on estimates of case mortality.
The World Health Organization is confirming that the pandemic is under control.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massig Bonney of Penn State University stated that: "Unsupervised infectious disease outbreaks typically reach a peak and then begin to decline when the disease finds no available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to come up with any rational prediction now about when that will be".
China's chief medical adviser to the government, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could be over by June" if all countries were encouraged to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be prevalent for perhaps a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College London led by scientist Neil Ferguson, we will have to rely on social distancing and other measures "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more later)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will go away completely because it's so easily transmissible", and may "turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively uncharacteristic and may not show symptoms in those infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, excretion of respiratory phlegm (phlegm), loss of olfaction, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood inhalation, diarrhea, or dyspnea. The World Health Organization confirms that approximately one in six people suffer severely from the disease and have difficulty breathing.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States restricts emergency symptoms to shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, facial or lip swelling. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Some people who do not have clinical symptoms but test results confirm their infection may be asymptomatic, so specialists have advised that people who have been in contact with confirmed cases should be monitored and closely examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; often five days. As an example of confusion, the estimated prevalence of COVID-19 patients with loss of smell was initially 30% and has recently decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being researched.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly during intercourse or through spraying when coughing, sneezing or talking; that is, when intercourse is at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that coughing without a mouth guard can result in a spray that spreads over a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus may also be transmitted by long-term airborne spraying, which may be produced during speech. Respiratory spraying may also be produced during the exhalation process, including when speaking, although the virus is not transmitted by the air in general.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of people close to you or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray and then cause airborne diffusion.
It can also spread when a person touches an infected surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from the faeces to the mouth, this risk is thought to be limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infectious during the first three days of symptom onset, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been found to be infected up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting the possibility of transmission before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) emphasizes that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have been confirmed to have COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, as well as from other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia who were in contact with a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all of its characteristics with naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, household soaps kill the virus, where its protective membrane is dissolved. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the coronavirus genus beta, and is classified under the subgenus SARS-CoV-2 (Stem B) as well as the two bat-derived strains.
It's 96% genome-wide match with other samples of coronaviruses in bats.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between viruses created by carnivorous ants and viruses created by humans.
Comparisons of whole genomes have so far detected an estimated 92% maximum genetic association between the ant-eating corona virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the ant-eating corona virus is the intermediate host of this virus.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is eventually made by RRT-PCR of infected secretions or CT scans.
A study in Wuhan comparing the interaction of PCR and CT scans indicated that PCR is more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathologies.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use CT scans for detection of COVID-19 or as a screening test for initial diagnosis of the disease".
The WHO published several ribosomal DNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on 17 January.
The test uses a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR).
The test can be done on samples from the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done by a nasopharyngeal swab, and a throat swab may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serum tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently proven to be accurate for widespread adoption.
A serum test developed by Celix has been approved for emergency use in the United States only in approved laboratories.
Imaging characteristics of radiography and computed tomography (CT) for people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral opacity such as stained glass opacity and distorted crystallographic bulging.
The Italian Society for Radiation has compiled an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without CPR is a limited accuracy procedure for detecting COVID-19 due to its interference with other diseases such as GNDV infection.
A large study in China compared the results of computed tomography of the chest with the polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that although imaging is less accurate in terms of proof of infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it as a screening tool in infected areas.
AI-based laminar neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus imaging in both X-ray and CT images.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, hand washing, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and then disposing of it directly in the trash.
Those already infected are advised to wear a face mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned non-essential travel from and to affected countries and regions or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the point of spreading throughout the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they became infected. Healthcare providers, caring for a person who may be infected, are advised to use the measures, contact precautions and eye protection considered necessary. Tracing of infected persons is an effective way to help health authorities identify the source of infection and prevent its spread.
The use of mobile phone location data for tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Many mobile applications have been designed or developed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, over a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are promoted about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and throat with a mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although several organizations are working to produce a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when clotting occurs on the hands, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
That's because household soap kills the virus outside the body, where it destroys its protective membrane.
The CDC also recommends using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned using several detergents (within one minute of staining the stainless steel surface), including: ethanol 6271%; isopropanol 50100%; sodium hypochlorite 0.1%; hydrogen peroxide 0.5%; and iodopropidone 0.27.5%.
There are other detergents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, that are less effective.
The CDC recommends that when a person is suspected of or has been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in a facility such as an office or care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, and common electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing by either bending their elbows and placing them in front of their mouth and nose or using a tissue and discarding any towels immediately.
Wearing a mask reduces the amount of respiratory spray and the distance it travels when it is spread by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the wearing of masks can reduce [people's] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if hands are not properly washed". Caregivers of people who may be infected are recommended to wear masks.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people not wear masks unless they are at high risk of infection, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the common people to wear face masks.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing non-medical facial masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially in the case of direct contact with people (at a distance of 1 metre (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a face mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a mask when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has required all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, required passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a face mask when going out mandatory, while also recommending home-made face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures that are aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
These include roads quarantined; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying home, reducing travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 outbreak was detected in the area) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. The elderly and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, and high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems, face an increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in outbreak areas between communities. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health bodies began replacing the term "social distancing" with the term "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to maintain social contact while maintaining social distancing, in addition to lack of distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who is not a carrier of the virus or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for COVID-19 patients and suspected cases.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued for those in the most at-risk groups.
Those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widespread are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of another potential exposure.
Outbreak control strategies are to contain or contain and limit the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of a disease becomes uncontainable, efforts are then directed to mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its impact on the health care system and the community.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Containment requires more stringent measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction number to less than 1. Part of managing infectious disease outbreaks is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of straining health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that may address outbreaks include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, mask wearing, and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gathering events; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces. More stringent measures targeted at containing the outbreak in China were taken once the severity of the outbreak became clear, such as the application of full-blown quarantine and the imposition of a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screenings and local quarantine, and issued alerts on the movements of those infected.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and taxed the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and containment (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and mortality by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strain health systems.
Containment may be preferred but must be maintained as long as the virus is spreading in humans (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that occurs first), as transmission on the other hand recurs rapidly when mitigation is relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and rest may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of stimulants may worsen the results.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are under review for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" can provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing the capacity and adapting health care facilities to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move resources on multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, removing selective procedures where possible, isolating and separating COVID-19 patients, increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available artificial and family respirators.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may have been on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these animal species; or in other words, had an animal origin. A group with pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Jianghan Wuhan Disease Control Center on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wen-liang, were issued with a police warning for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Wen, was reprimanded by her superiors for triggering the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the Wuhan health authorities that they began investigating in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by travel during the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being a transport hub and a major railway junction.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later published official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the world's largest number of confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, there were reported to be over 1.61 million cases worldwide, with over 97,000 people dead and over 364,000 people recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdown) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people were under lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million were under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were under lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, a number that rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian noticed a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, and her hospital subsequently informed the Jianghan Bouhan Disease Control Center on December 27.
A genetic test of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The WHO was informed the same day.
In light of these notifications, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that the Communist Party of China's General Secretary Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a curfew was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been canceled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Hoochinshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, the Lichenshan Hospital, to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
Hong Kong and Macau have taken several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Teleworking measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in and out of Hobby.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement controls were imposed in several cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) were subject to some form of curfew. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "brought" to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries.On 23 March, one case was transferred locally in mainland China in the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese State Council President Li Keqiang mandated the decrease of locally transmitted infections and control of the outbreak in China.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased the same day, except for Wuhan, after two months of lockdown. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the suspension of entry of visa or residence permit holders from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would expire.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on 30 March, and provided a set of monetary incentives for companies. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with three minutes of silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online with due regard to physical distancing to avoid a re-outbreak of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.
The National Health Agency reported a sharp increase in confirmed cases on February 20, and this is largely attributed to a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji followers who visit Daegu from Wuhan are the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people or about 13% of the 9,336 church followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert levels on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been placed under quarantine after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented what is considered the largest and best-managed program in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate anyone infected, and track and quarantine those who have had contact.
Testing methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via a mobile app, testing for the virus in people in their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people a day.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite not implementing quarantine on entire cities.South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for Moon's removal, claiming government mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On 23 March, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test for the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on 19 February in Qom, with two deaths later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early actions announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closing of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, only individuals will be quarantined.
Plans to reduce inter-city travel were announced in March, although heavy inter-city traffic continued before the Persian New Year, Nu'reez.
The Shiite shrine in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became the center of the virus's spread after China.
Amid claims of Iran covering up the extent of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases from Iran starting on 28 February, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have been infected with the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful opposition, and also to temporarily release qualified prisoners.
She said there is a high risk of the virus spreading in closed places such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials have died of the disease as of March 17.
By 23 March, Iran was reporting 50 new cases every hour and one death every ten minutes from the coronavirus.
According to an official at the World Health Organization, the number of cases in Iran may be up to five times the reported number.
It is also thought that US sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial ability to respond to the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by this pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on 31 January, when SARS-CoV-2 tests for Chinese tourists in Rome came back positive.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated set of COVID-19 cases were later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a decree for a new law to contain the outbreak, including quarantine for more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "It will not be allowed to enter or exit the outbreak areas.
Work and sporting activities in those areas have already been ordered to be suspended". On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country as the death toll in Italy reached 100.
All major sporting events, including Premier League football matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all business activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesiology, Tranquilization, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding the screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths due to the pandemic.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 cases in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggested that a combination of a large number of elderly people and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high death rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its marked lack of speed and intensity in responding to the concerns facing the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising people to avoid unnecessary travel or social interaction, suggesting people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all leisure facilities such as pubs and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages with a maximum of £2,500 per month to reduce unemployment in times of crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, with gatherings of more than two people prohibited and travel and outdoor activity restricted except for extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the issuing of fines and dispersing of gatherings.
Orr ordered the closure of most businesses, except "essential" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government's leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing this, the United States was slow to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test was marred by a flawed test kit produced by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval of non-government test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until late February, and restricted criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was then required).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On 22 March, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who experienced symptoms and had a doctor's order waited hours or days for testing".

On March 13, he declared a national emergency, which enabled the use of federal funds to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many businesses have closed or reduced hours across the United States in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the outbreak had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, New York City reported 10,700 cases of coronavirus, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the governor said social distancing appeared to have been successful, with estimates showing a slowing of the case multiplication from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people had died from the virus. On March 26, more confirmed cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people had died.

Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported as the least capable of over 20 popular destinations in terms of readiness, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia released its Emergency Response Plan for the emerging coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
It was mentioned that much has yet to be discovered about the COVID-19 virus, and that Australia will be tightening border and communications controls in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the impact of public transportation on the effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.

Medical screening was done before departure, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left to mitigate risk.
South Africans who had only negative test results were sent back.
The test results showed that the South Africans, including the flight crew, the pilots, the hotel staff, the police and the soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who all remained, as a precautionary measure, under surveillance and quarantine at the Ranch Resort for 14 days, were not infected.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On 5 February, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.

In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where the AU handled the distribution.
He later sent to Panama 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 respirators.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic have expressed concern over the masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 coronavirus test kits made in China that were only 30% accurate, and meanwhile, the Netherlands returned 600,000 facial masks made in China that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed the Chinese aid well.On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002 and 2004 SARS outbreaks, where Chinese authorities were blamed for the blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government has provided "regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, responding to the central authorities' decision to implement a transportation lockdown in Wuhan, WHO representative Godden Galia noted that while this "is certainly not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is heavily concentrated", calling it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the confirmation of the person-to-person spread outside China, and the increase in cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEI), the sixth of the worst public health emergencies of international concern since the outbreak during the 2009 Incheon pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said that the outbreak is considered a public health emergency of international concern due to the "risk of global spread, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not have robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community for $675 million in strategic funds to be set up in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have systems to detect people with the virus, even if it emerges".
Tedros also made statements declaring that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest among us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a heavy price later". On 11 February, the World Health Organization named the disease, at a press conference, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros reported that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to deliver "the full potential of the UN system in response".
As a result, a UN crisis management team was set up, which allowed for the coordination of the entire UN response, and the WHO would allow it to "focus on health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to understand the broader social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-China-led mission team was set up to bring international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in local management and assess the "severity and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops, meetings with key national institutions, and making field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, the WHO announced that "the world needs to do more to prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic", noting that because it was previously considered a pandemic, states should be "on alert".
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said the global threat assessment for coronavirus would rise from "high" to "extremely high", the highest level of its warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Emergency Health Program, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for every government on the planet: so we have to be prepared.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared for it", urging the right response measures that can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that the current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we are basically accepting that every person on this planet will be exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO "is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence, severity, and alarming levels of inactivity". The WHO has faced strong criticism for what is seen as inadequate handling of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
Violent reactions included a petition for WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The panel said that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears that responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, those belonging to minorities, the elderly, the internally displaced, the homeless, those living in extreme conditions, the detained, as well as refugees and other unidentified groups who need government support.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The OECD has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro over its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
A number of CPC (Communist Party of China) executives were fired at a multi-sector level for their handling of the quarantine efforts in central China, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping from public displeasure over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have dismissed earlier claims that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories alleged by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The US administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China "imposed a cover-up that has exacerbated the virus that has now become a global pandemic", which some critics have criticized for being racist and "distracting [attention] from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast got a US government cable reviewing a communication plan with clear sources at the National Security Council, strategically stating that "everything is about China.
We were asked to seek and spread these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive for global influence.
EU foreign policy official Josep Borrell warned of a "geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of bypassing and altruistic policies".
Burrell also said, "China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and trusted partner".
China has also called on the US to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it is reportedly sending aid to the latter two states.
US sanctions have banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid that was intended for other countries back to their own country.
There have been reported mask-related conflicts between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union for its lack of solidarity with Italy, which was suffering from the coronavirus.
Mauritzio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said, "It was China that responded only at the bilateral level.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity".
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian Army to send military medics, special sanitation vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
Lombardy's president Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and supplies are active again, they will also be able to pay back the favor if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Gun 2020" will take place in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest war drill NATO will conduct since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary-General Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Gunners Training, saying: "In light of the current public health crisis, the training not only endangers the lives of troops from the United States and several participating European countries but also the populations of the countries in which it will be conducted". The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament as well as fifteen other former or current political figures infected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has raised calls in the United States for the adoption of social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "vague and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at designated government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's isolation because they claimed the government mishandled the outbreak or praised his response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to assert their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspending parliament as well as elections and punishing those who published false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak that led to many supply shortages was blamed on the increased global use of outbreak control equipment, panic buying, and disrupted factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier shutdowns.
Many areas also saw panic buying, leading to shelves being empty of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, causing a shortage of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of the delay in shipments of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by a factor of 100.
This demand has led to prices rising up to 20 times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for between four and six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Diageo's retailers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan area, and the ensuing high demand for food products, the two regions have survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and trafficking of bio-products have averted severe food shortages in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives' expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure the population had enough food.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on 16 March, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial center, the virus outbreak has been observed to pose a major destabilizing threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture of the likely outcome was seen.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic fallout of the pandemic on global growth could exceed that of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly experienced "disruption" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard & Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their biggest declines since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, its biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week down more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop on 16 March.
Many believe that a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed Al-Arian praised the emergency measures being taken by central banks and states in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they did in the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closure of public places including tourist attractions, and travel warnings to governments around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, East China Airways, and Qantas, while British regional airline, Flybe, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports were closed as well.
The outbreak coincided with the travel season of the Spring Festival known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events with large crowds, including New Year's Eve celebrations, with private companies also shutting down independently owned stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions in China, authorities have extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and issued instructions to most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail sector globally has been affected by store hours reductions or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60 percent.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have implemented additional measures, such as increased hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of activities. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced stagnation could leave between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty, more than would have otherwise suffered without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the estimated 300 million rural Chinese migrant workers are trapped in their homes in the interior counties, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through the daily wage) unemployed. The survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers into government-backed short-term work schemes known as Kurzarbeits.
France and Britain have adopted a German short-time working compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals working and freelancing globally.
Arts and culture sector organisations have sought to support their (mostly government-funded) mission to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, to maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
As of March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have been closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Among other recent accelerated consequences of the disease have been the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a setback. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian season of penance in Lent.
Many Christian dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home instead of attending Sunday services; some churches have made church services available via radio, live Internet or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and cathedral, and evacuating St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and subsequently closed the shrine, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its own population to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 Europa League, the 2019-20 American Professional Basketball League season, and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak delayed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to after 2020 but by the summer of 2021 at the latest". Gambling clubs and other gaming venues around the world were closed and live tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to move online, as many online gambling sites have reported large increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, as various bands have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many big theaters like the one on Broadway have suspended all performances as well.
Some artists have found ways to continue to produce and share work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating online "celebrations" for artists to perform, distribute and publicize their work.
Many internet memes about the coronavirus have been circulating on the web, with many turning to humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a strong bias, xenophobia, and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world towards the Chinese as deserving of the virus or receiving what was allegedly a justified punishment.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also been rising in some African countries.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for Chinese people both online and offline, and for those living in the affected areas.
After the outbreak spread to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may be subject to xenophobia and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to pressure the Chinese to enter their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is being used on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and the US reported increasing levels of racial abuse, as well as assaults.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term that critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, who study in India's major cities, have faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The BJP's West Bengal state unit chief Dileep Ghosh stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements, calling them "false". In China, the pandemic led to an increase in xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" and targeted "to be disposed of".
Many newspapers removed paid subscription pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak available for open access.
Some scientists chose to share their findings quickly on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus by recognizing the antibodies that are produced in response to the infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in samples, where it detects the ribose DNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect the ribose DNA of SARS-CoV-2.
Used to confirm cases of very recent or active infection.
Antibody detection is used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including those who have had symptoms too mild to be reported or who have not had symptoms.
The exact mortality rate for the disease and the level of herd immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population in March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This variation is also likely to significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
The test can be performed using a reverse transcriptase sequence polymerase (RT-PCR) assay on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or a sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR done with a throat swab is not recommended until the first week of illness.
The virus may disappear from the throat after that while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, a sample of the deep airway can instead be taken by suction or by use of a cough syrup.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the Reverse Transcription RRT-PCR sequence polymerase reaction, and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a SARS-CoV-2 PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit suitable for safe clinical use and relies on PCR on 28 January 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the CDC has distributed a PCR-based RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through the International Narcotics Control Board.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to faulty detectors, and one of the test phases was delayed by others at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully completed throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components did not gain confidence until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to begin conducting the tests.
The FDA approved the test under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting the tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a nationwide COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing must be conducted in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the State Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology developed and produced the COVID-19 test Victor.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Supervision Service (FHSHS) registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed within 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform nearly 4128 tests over 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Holographic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cefid received similar emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses heat-sensitive DNA amplification instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing to perform 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a single-strain antibody specifically bound to the nucleic acid protein (N-protein) of the novel coronavirus, hoping to achieve results in 15 to 20 minutes like the rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic radiographs have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may be evident even before symptoms appear".
Typical features seen in CT include two-sided multi-focal laminated glass blinds with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
A subdural spread develops, and irregular lesions appear and intensify as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT imaging with respect to the origin of the current pandemic indicated that CT imaging is more sensitive than PCR, though less precise, with many of its imaging characteristics overlapping with cases of pneumonia and other disease stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "not using CT scans to detect COVID-19 or as a primary screening test to diagnose the disease". In March 2020, the CDC recommended using PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals within 7 days or after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in case of population surveillance. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care (POCT) testing.
The high-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but how much they can provide will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, one peripheral blood cell sample is typically used, although sequential samples may be used to follow up the immune response.
For the clinical point-of-care test, a single blood sample is typically drawn through a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the pre-test extraction step is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that had notified the agency under the requirements and that these entities could distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test can complete several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral ribosome DNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK discovered that its antibody testing kits were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has set up a plan whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube", spits in the tube, and returns it again to get the test result after a short time. The British National Health Service announced that it is piloting a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus ruling out the risk of transmission from infected people when they come to the hospital or the need to sterilize the used ambulance.
South Korea's in-vehicle testing centers have enabled some of the fastest and most comprehensive testing in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it was able to conduct about 12,000 outpatient tests per day and had 10,700 people tested in the past week.
The health insurance covers the costs if the doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-car testing was made available in many major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only the results of positive cases were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study found that starting from calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested by the end of week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method to examine samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and subjected them to that method of testing, by collecting the samples and not performing further tests only when the sample is found to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened a temporary laboratory for emergency diagnosis with a 2,000-square-meter "Yan-Huo" (pronounced: 火眼: or "Fire Eye" in English) that can examine more than 10,000 samples in 5 days, which is in English.
With BGI founder Wang Jian overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to do so, the modeling showed that cases in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capacity had not been achieved.
Huo-Yan Laboratories were immediately followed by Wuhan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, a shortage of detectors and inadequate detectors caused a standoff when a large number of tests were conducted in the EU, UK and the US.
This has led some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free the ribosome DNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is the top country in the world in terms of testing for its population, and is on track to raise the level of testing to reach the majority of the population.
This was through a combination of activating the testing capability in the car, and purchasing a population-friendly, high-productivity laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection labs in China).
The lab was set up in 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests to be carried out daily, and is the first laboratory of its size in the world operating outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus's genetic traits have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German plan to manufacture kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own kits.
The German plan was announced on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, delaying the available tests in the US. China and the US had problems with how reliable the testing kits were early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and follow the testing procedures recommended by health experts.
In contrast, experts stated that South Korea's abundance of testing helped to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing programs as the optimal solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in private US laboratories, and has depleted supplies of scanners and chemical detectors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, "flaws" were found in the test kits invented by the CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test from being conducted privately. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Limited, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or to improper use of the equipment.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw from purchasing the kits that gave incorrect results, and would replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović proposed dumping them in the Danube River. Prof. Ahmet Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and had been "banned from use".
Tests, followed by quarantine of those confirmed to have the virus and follow-up of those who have had contact with those with SARS-CoV-2, have produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fo, which saw the first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days each time.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the inter-city curfew, new infections have been completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decline in the rate of spread compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments; through strict tracking of contacts, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore had already begun urging residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March on schedule after the holiday expired.
Several other countries have also controlled this pandemic through strict contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less stringent lockdown decisions, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that had more tests than deaths had much lower death rates, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the testing capacity or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 laboratories approved by WHO for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the column "Positive percent of tests" is affected by the policy of the country in conducting the test.
A country that tests only people who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive cases compared to a country that tests its entire population, whether they appear symptomatic or not, other factors being equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal tract.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important include: before and after defecating, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry and afterwards.
If soap and water are not available, hands may be washed with ash.
Before, during, and after the preparation of food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a baby's diaper or cleaning after a bathroom break.
After you've cleaned your nose, or coughed, or sneezed.
Never touch animals, their feed, or their excrement.
Medical hygiene refers to the hygienic practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to disinfect hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who work with food or in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for individuals in general.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrheal infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
And reduce the infant mortality rate at home birth.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing practices may lead to modest improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, infant death rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
So this simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50 percent.
Measures that encourage hand-washing can reduce diarrhea attacks by nearly a third, which is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the reduction in diarrhea attacks can be linked to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and least costly method of prevention of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (AREs) when implementing automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the number one cause of death in children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children annually.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet an enduring habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against measles, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor adverse effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of scaling and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five essential times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of disease via the oral route: after using the toilet (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing should be practiced in other situations to prevent the transmission of disease, including before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing or coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal feces, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is declining.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at an estimated 97%, the United States was closer to the average at 77%, and China was at the lowest at 23%. Many behaviour change methodologies now exist to maximize the use of handwashing with soap at times of need.
The "Basic Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The twice-a-year worm treatment, along with daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride tooth brushing, is at the core of this national program.
It's been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soaps or detergents to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce decomposition barriers, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective disinfectant for skin because fats and proteins, the organic soil components, are not easily broken down in water.
However, a proper amount of water helps to cleanse...
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transmission from contaminated soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that "liquid soap is preferable to touchless devices for soap dispensing".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is being selected to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So if antibacterial soap doesn't work in antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it's marketed to be.
In addition to the surface tension reducer and skin protection agent, the advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as the regulated pH, benzoic acid, active antimicrobial and other skin moisturizers (barley, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
The hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer is a non-water-based substance for washing hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that are not water-based and sterilize through rubbing (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizer or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compounded with a thickening agent such as a carboomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or a foam for ease of use and to reduce the dehydrating effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germicides.
Alcoholic rubbery infections are caused by bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enteric cocci), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, MERS, RNV, SARS, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol by rubbing eliminate 99.97% (a logarithmic reduction of 3.5, similar to a 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on hands after 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a logarithmic reduction of between 4 and 5) of bacteria on hands after 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizers are considered more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk), the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and their extremities for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with a hand sanitizer, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and quick activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless water and soap are available.
Repeated use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause skin dryness unless rainwater, moisturizers, or both are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine or other moisturizers or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing rabies cause less irritation and dryness to the skin than soaps or antimicrobial cleaners.
Allergic dermatitis, pleural atherosclerosis, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcoholic hand washes are rare.
The reduced incidence of irritant dermatitis has become a factor of attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Although effective, non-water-based hand sanitizers do not clean hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on the ingredients and the composition, and historically it has been significantly less effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizer, which relies on rubbing alcohol.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to gradual adverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ashes or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, too, like soap, is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended that ashes or sand be used instead of soap when it is not available.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended handwashing method for preventing transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing pools may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make a foam on the hands by rubbing with a large amount of soap, covering the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods of time removes more germs.
Well, under the running water.
Washing hands inside the sink can lead to re-contamination.
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Wet, moist hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and split nails may contain microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent drying of the hands, as drying can damage the skin and may increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended bowl or drawing with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to optimize water consumption, such as "tibi tap" and other low-cost options.
The tippi tap is a simple technique that uses a pitcher suspended by a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public restrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Seminar for the Paper Towel Industry, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and the latest jet air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the fingertips by 194% and on the palm by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the average fingertips decreased by up to 76% and on the palm of the hand by 77%, and scientists conducted tests to determine whether there was a chance of infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing micro-organisms out of the hands and device, and may transmit infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and they've been developing paper towel hand dryers.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel due to the lack of soap and water.
An alcohol hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Agnathus Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found a decrease in the incidence of infection using them.
A medical handwashing is for at least 15 seconds, using copious amounts of soap, water or gel to make a foam and rubbing each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together and the fingers interlocked.
If there is feces under the fingernails, a brush with coarse hair can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids getting your hands dirty again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove disease-causing microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a paper outlining hand washing and rubbing in the health care sector.
The draft hand hygiene guideline provided by the WHO can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others have made a related review.
Commercial bodies can measure and verify hand hygiene, if it is necessary to prove compliance with the regulations.
The World Health Organization has "five moments" for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before the sterilization mission,
After care of the patient. The addition of disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antibacterial") adds a disinfectant to the handwashing agent.
This exterminating element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When "rubbing" one's hands to perform a surgical operation, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine lotion, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile brush for rubbing, and another sterile tool for under-nail cleaning are required.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
A long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from bouncing from the forearms to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control cluster tick infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand sanitization came from the first 20% of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when hand washing frequency increased to over 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rubbing with an alcohol solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds on average, it was found that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective than alcohol hand sanitizers for reducing influenza A virus H1N1 and the spread of hand-borne infections. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating staff about hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, there is a recognition that handwashing with soap is a cost-effective and essential tool for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with public handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps are rarely found near every private or public toilet, although there are inexpensive options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may be due to inherent habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term population behavior change.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" that UNICEF designed to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to eventually three stars.
Building handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing promotion campaigns that are being conducted to reduce childhood disease and deaths.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaigns that are trying to achieve behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emoji.
Few studies have looked at the effectiveness of the total cost of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people going through critical situations such as newly born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian physician Agnet Simmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing".
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to a foul odor called miasma.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "proper handwashing methods" have been hung next to handwashing basins in public toilets and in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something means a declaration of one's unwillingness to take responsibility for or participate in something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins by over-washing her hands in an attempt to cleanse a fictional stain that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes her husband urged her to commit.
It was also found that people, after referring to or thinking about unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to value handwashing utensils more highly.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to wash their hands after this study were less likely to participate in other compensatory "cleansing" procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual of hand washing that has appeared in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tevi'ah, hand washing in Judaism, bathing in Christianity, and prostration in Islam. Religions also mandate the washing of hands, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require handwashing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace
The COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk controls depend on the work site and job assignment, based on risk assessment of exposure sources, community disease risk, and risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations involve minimal contact with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which it is recommended to apply basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing coughing and sneezing etiquette, and maintaining routine practices for cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high-labor-density work environments, and some large retail locations.
Risk controls for this group include, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, cough prevention barriers, and use of personal protective equipment available in the case of handling a person with COVID-19.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers health care and mortuary workers exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person to be at high exposure risk levels, which increases to extremely high exposure risk if workers are performing aerosol generation procedures, collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 person.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple impacts in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the type of goods required and the ways of obtaining them (e.g. shopping outside peak hours, delivery services, or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from COVID-19-affected geographical areas may be halted. The Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to guide preventive actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and sub-national recommendations.
The goals of the outbreak response include limiting the transmission of infection among employees, protecting people most at risk of adverse health complications, preserving business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
A risk control hierarchy is a framework widely used in the field of occupational safety and health to classify effective risk controls.
Since the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policy or procedures that require action by the employee or the employer.
PPE is less effective than engineering and management controls, but can help prevent some exposure situations.
All types of personal protective equipment must be chosen based on the risk to which the worker is exposed, the correct fit as required (e.g. respirators), continuous and correct wearing, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement as necessary, and removal, cleaning and storage, or proper disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less risk exposure involve minimal interaction with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and garbage containers, being prepared to work remotely or alternately if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms have subsided for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that the employee be familiar with these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, moderate exposure risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known to have or suspect to have COVID-19 but may contract SARS-CoV-2 due to persistent transmission in the surrounding community of the workplace, or due to the person's recent international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is occurring.
This includes workers who come into contact with general audiences such as in schools, high-labor density work environments, and some large-scale retail locations. Engineering controls for high-risk groups include installing highly efficient air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the vehicle. Administrative controls for high-risk groups include encouraging employees to stay at home, replacing meetings with face-to-face meetings, creating organized work environments, and not traveling to high-risk locations where they may encounter high-efficiency air filters, using more ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneeze guards, installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the vehicle. The management controls for high-risk groups include encouraging employees to stay at home, replacing meetings with face-to-face meetings, creating organized workplaces, and not traveling to high-risk locations where they may encounter high-efficient air filters, increasing ventilation, using physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the vehicle, and other factors, including the need to avoid COVID-19 and to be prepared for work, and to meet COVID-19 risk, and to prevent, and to protect from, employ, at least, meet COVID-19-related health and other health and work-related hazards, including the employee's, training and other work-related needs, and personal and other factors.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use breathing aids.
If a person becomes ill while on a flight, appropriate precautions to protect the staff and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger 6 feet away from others, assigning one member of the flight crew to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew should wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolation and informing the onboard medical center immediately if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantined person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is a low to moderate level of community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or band classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing office spacing, setting up consecutive attendance and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health desk for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school absences may be considered. For law enforcement personnel performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact confirmed or suspected COVID-19 individuals are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of direct contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reuse using a spray or household cleaning swab, and follow standard work procedures for handling contamination, disposal of used personal protective equipment, and collection and washing of clothing.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers some health care and mortuary workers to fall within the categories of high or very high exposure levels.
High-risk occupations include those working in health care delivery, support, operations, and medical transportation who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This becomes a very high risk level if workers perform aerobic respiratory procedures, as well as collect samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients or handling them.
Aeration procedures include tubes, coughing procedures, cataract scans, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sample collection.
High-risk morgue jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of people confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high-risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, including when performing aerial respiration procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary settings.
The samples must be handled with biosecurity precautions level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the isolation of incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of breathing apparatus for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those performing aerobic procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter-equipped face masks, certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes mounting testing, fitting, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of plungers, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, care for them, or transport them without any procedures to generate aerosols, the WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, safety glasses, face shields, handcuffs and gloves.
If an air-generating procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those participants in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the personal protective equipment necessary for the specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring the supply chain and coordination of personal protective equipment, and excluding the use of respirators for individuals who do not show symptoms.

The following is a list of countries by total number of airports.
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We've found ourselves in extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a clear demonstration of the global human connection and the responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen such challenges, but we know for a fact that the best response depends on a kind of global empathy and collaboration and community building, which are the core elements of this institution.
The warmth and care we have witnessed among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a practically amazing testament to the amazing human emotions that, fortunately, surround the way we do business.
I feel a profound gratitude and a profound pride for being true fellows.
Last week, someone sent me a letter to express his appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is that the world can go to Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism of keeping this important resource available online and open to all.
Your efforts have made this possible, whether it's by keeping our sites running, or getting our colleagues paid, or providing safety for our communities.
The world needs the information on Wikipedia more than ever.
It's a moment where not only are the efforts we make having a positive impact on the world, but also the way we make them.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some major changes to how we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to the way and timetables of work
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our approach and our timetable for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought might be the appropriate response to what we were facing, and the perfect way to keep the foundation's business sustainable during this period.
We were very keen to get rid of the stress and the pressure, and sustain our mission over the long term.
If you want to reduce the burden and the tasks, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not announcing a holiday, so if you are able to work longer than normal working hours, you may add to the task.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you want to care for your loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We're not tracking your times.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should be understood as allowing it without expressing it, but we mention it as affirmation.
You do not need sick leave or paid leave. Just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor diagnoses you as having COVID-19, please inform Brian at the Training and Certification Department so that the Training and Certification Department can help provide support and ensure that you receive appropriate care from the Department.)
Hourly colleagues get paid in full.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment with our obligations to our contractors and fellow watchmen.
Each employee will receive a salary based on the normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we're behind you.
Many people use work to cope with the stresses of the world around us.
What we can do is incredibly productive, especially in times of crisis like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
All we ask is that you contact your manager so he can know what to expect and adjust the procedures to accommodate accordingly.
Some jobs are necessary.
There are also some things that we have to keep going.
The site reliability engineering, HR, trust, integrity, fundraising (and other) teams are doing a critical job, which may need more support.
We're going to begin a process of collaborating with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There's a lot of work for all of us to do, and we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Slow down now, it won't hurt us later.
We're not planning to "double down" on the pandemic.
We're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that I currently consider unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines when it becomes appropriate.
What happens in the APP?
To adjust to the new reality and daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We plan to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and elder care while accommodating those who need or want to work a reduced work schedule, over the next few weeks.
This extension to the schedule relieves the burden of current planning and pressure across the entire organization.
We'll present our proposal to the board next week and update delegates and teams on next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning Team for their pioneering role in this.
Office and exposure and cleaning .
We learned last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an abundance of caution and restraint, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used a hospital-grade antiretroviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units leading to our floor.
The building has implemented its own duty of care protocol to use products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable that the office is conveniently set up until the time we decide to return to work.
Our Washington, DC office is in a building owned by WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all of our Washington, DC, HQ team members.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C., office moved to a completely remote location in accordance with a shared direction with our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be a fix, and they wanted to give you some advice:
The time of meetings should be limited to a maximum of one hour or gradually increased to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consideration should be given to how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly scheduled, the agenda prepared and the reading material sent in advance.
Video should be the default solution, and tools like Google Docs and Zoom should facilitate collaboration and face-to-face communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated by an initiative, with one person monitoring the conversation to find out the questions and track the list of speakers, and another person to help with the note-taking (or carrying out the collaborative note-taking process).
When you need a comfortable headset, you should email the tech support.
The Health and Safety Compensation Scheme can be used to cover the cost of snacks.
You can join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR operations team is looking for user-friendly meeting-based guidance to support the growth of our enterprise-wide distributed business.
Over the past week, we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel all public events that Wikimedia has funded, such as the Editathon Web Editors' Websites until the World Health Organization declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or adjust these goals.
We'll be releasing additional follow-up guidance next week for Wikimedia and other community-regional and topic-specific conferences.
The general feelings that dominate the global community are confused between sadness over the disorder, and relief over the clarity and the ability to focus on their communities and Wikimedia and others.
In light of these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page on MetaWiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and track all communications with it.
Staying on top of COVID-19 related topics
We'll be sending out an invitation to your calendars next Thursday at 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for a special task force meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We're going through this together and we're always ready to help out as much as we can.
In the meantime, we can continue to get information from this email, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information available on Office Wiki.
The crisis response team will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular contacts with workers residing in severely affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please feel free to let us know and work with the crisis response team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please send an email to Brian Gooden, Global Operations Manager for International Human Resources.
Any such change shall not be deemed to be a waiver of our work or obligations.
Instead, it's a realization that in this present moment, our work and our commitments are becoming more urgently needed to adapt to situations in a way that we haven't in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to operate and provide our workers with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we planned to accomplish will be waiting for us when the time comes to do it.
Now, it's time for everyone to help each other and create space for the important work that is coming in the weeks and months ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, and so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you're in the best shape when the time comes to make your efforts.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the director of the crisis response team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jimmy V, Janine Y, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
ACE2 binds to the outer surface (membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as the intestines.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE) antagonizes the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is also an entryway for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallic enzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The enzyme protein translated to angiotensin 2 contains an M2 peptide domain with an amino end and a carboxyl chain colectrin transporter for the renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein, with active enzyme receptors located on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular portion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is separated from the trans-membrane domain by an enzyme called Shidaz, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then excreted in the urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is found in most organs: it is bound to the cell membrane of type 2 cancer cells in the lungs, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The DNA messenger for the enzyme that converts angiotensin 2 is found in the cerebral cortex, the stratum splenium, the subthalmosphere, and the brain stem.
The primary function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is to act as a balancer for angiotensin-converting enzyme.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 by the blood vessel-capping hormone angiotensin.
In contrast, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 separates the carboxylate end of the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine) and is converted to angiotensin (1-7) (histidine-aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine) and is then further processed by the enzyme.
The converted enzyme angiotensin 2 is cleaved into a number of other peptides including [dis-arginine9]-pradricinine, aplein, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and gerelin.
The angiotensin 2 transducer also regulates the membrane-neutral transport of the amino acid SLC6A19 and has a role in Hartnbe's disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, as a transmembrane protein, is the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, which include human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binds to the enzyme domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on the cell surface to cellular uptake and viral and enzyme transport to the intracellular particles that are located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the S protein to be formulated by the host's own transmembrane protease enzyme, serine2, which is still being inhibited in experimental trials as a potential treatment. This leads some to assume that lowering the levels of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in cells may help to fight the infection.
However, many specialist societies and self-regulating bodies recommend the continued use of conventional angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed "that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to the reference group".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was reduced among those who received treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and who were at increased risk of pneumonia, especially those who had a stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) led to a decrease in the mortality rate from pneumonia, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung injury, as it has been found to improve pulmonary blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs suffering from acute respiratory syndrome induced by polycystic ovary syndrome.
The half-life of angiotensin-2 is approximately 10 hours, with action starting after 30 minutes and continuing for up to 24 hours.
There is ample evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme A2 may be a promising treatment for those with intolerance to conventional angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) and in diseases with high levels of angiotensin in the blood. There are clinical trials under evaluation, for the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme A2 infusion in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are software applications for mobile devices that are specifically designed to help track contacts in the 2019-20 coronavirus response, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been put in place to design contact tracing applications.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of application users.
Less privacy-invasive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity from other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they have integrated a function that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It's an app that individuals in over 200 Chinese cities use.
The design of the app was taken over by a local IT association, released as an open-source app and is scheduled to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "!StopKorona", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to contact individuals with potential infection and provide rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in cooperation with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the app.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting accreditation from Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that a contact tracking app was in advanced development and could be available for distribution in weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, StopCovid.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app, as well as the BlueTress protocol. Russia intends to launch an app that uses the geographic virtual ocean of patients whose doctors have diagnosed COVID-19 from residents in Moscow, and is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has cited a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if application use is restricted to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their own coronavirus-related apps to its App Store; restricting this to "official" or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance arising from the use of coronavirus apps, particularly whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
The monitoring should be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include clauses on when to terminate them;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
The security of data and the confidentiality of the identity of its owners should be protected and proven based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
Safeguards against abuse and protection of citizens' rights should be provided to address abuse;
"Active participation" is required from all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted web-based location tracking instead of using apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing tracking avoidance.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunications (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used an app-free system to track contacts.
Instead of using a custom app, the system aggregates tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and incorporates this data to send notifications via text message to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws after the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in that country.
This information is publicly available through a number of apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details on this have not been released.
Privacy-conserving contact tracing is a well-established and successful concept supported by a strong research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked to come up with privacy-compliant solutions, such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to record nearby user from other cell phones.
However, BIPB-PT was a coordinated effort containing both centralized and decentralized approaches, rather than a single protocol. Decentralization-based protocols include privacy-preserving decentralized approaches (DB-PTP/DB-3T), temporary contact numbers (TNC, formerly known as contact event numbers, CIN), privacy-sensitive protocols, mobile device contact tracing (MTCP) and others.
In these protocols, the personal identification data does not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location or pathway data and leveraging them to track the spread of COVID-19.
The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy-focused technology development company that also originally originated at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, and aimed to reduce dispersion and enable global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature to achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTris protocol, used by the government's official app, open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced a contact tracing initiative; claiming to preserve privacy by combining low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption.
They also published specifications for the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to bring the system to three stages:
Tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving apps to track the coronavirus
Embed this function directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve the continuous monitoring and usage problems by distributing systems first through OS updates and then by removing them in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Drug re-purposing (also known as reuse, re-targeting, or drug-specific therapy) is the re-purposing of an approved drug for a different disease or medical condition than it was originally designed to treat.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transmission of the nasal plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each containing multiple binding sites for the binders.
Analysis of these sites provides a reasonable linking plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the A-like protease, the DNA-dependent ribose polymerase, the helicase, the S-protein, and the adenosine diphosphate ribose phosphatase.
Hussain A.A. et al. have studied several candidate compounds that have subsequently undergone refinement and analysis for structural similarity to approved drugs with the highest similarity in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend it in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs under study as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24. On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA through a clinical trial process and is licensed under an emergency use license only as an experimental treatment for emergency use to treat patients who are admitted to the hospital but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDC stated that it has not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention, treatment, dosing or duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection".
The doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
There are big studies going on at Duke and Oxford.
New York University's Langone School of Medicine is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylactic use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Vafibravir was "clearly effective".
Among 35 patients in Shenzhen, test results were negative for an average of 4 days, while the illness period was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and the other half were given omfenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that the evidence supporting the drug is limited and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan to add it to its stockpile, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant.
One study using lupinavir/retonavir (calcitra), a combination of the antiviral combination lupinavir and retonavir, reported that the results "did not show any benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is seeing a case of criticism about channeling resources to redefining the purpose of drugs designed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has added lupinavir/ritonavir to the international solidarity trial.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir exhibited antiviral activity in the laboratory against several mycobacterial viruses, mycobacterial viruses, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two at the University Hospitals of Cleveland; one for moderate disease, and one for severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C on patients who were hospitalized and suffered severe illness due to COVID-19, as well as two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York state began trials on the efficacy of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Teijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A phase II trial using a form of angiotensin 2 transducer is currently underway in 200 patients who are required to join the trial from acute hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, included 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without needing hospital admission.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is now widely used to treat patients, requiring the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-center study in Italy involving 300 patients to investigate the use of Sodium Inoxaparin in both prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs that were designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Ominofvir: Ominofvir is recommended by specialists for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some of the antibiotics that have been identified by specialists as potentially reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tosilizumab (anti-interleukin 6 receptor): approved by the Chinese.
Trials in Italy and China as well.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, there are several ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations Initiative for vaccine development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment, and global reach.
In April, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that has been submitted to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxygenated ribosome DNA and ribosome DNA) (stage one developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer of phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and a type 5 adenovirus carrier)
According to the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in April, there are a total of 115 candidate vaccines in early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 projects announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in the planning or design phase).
Phase I and II trials are preliminary safety and immunization tests, usually randomized, randomly controlled, in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including a reference group, and testing the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease, while monitoring for adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "pre-clinical" research).
On or about January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular-combination vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to induce an immune response.
On or about January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with human testing targeted to begin in 2021.

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Equipment Command at Fort Derrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had teamed up with Novavax Inc.
In developing and manufacturing a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with the accelerated pace of work, it would take at least one and a half to almost two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it was developing a coronavirus-like particle partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans for human testing in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "significant sums of money" for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to co-develop a vaccine based on transposed ribosome DNA.
The RNA-based vaccine, BNT162 candidate, is currently undergoing preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and that its final vaccine candidate could begin human trials by the autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the EPA in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
The partners in the pandemic preparedness innovation coalition for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing for six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enlarged ribosome DNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "Sars-Cov-2 subunit vaccines given with microscopic needles induced strong responses to specific antigen [in mice] that were evident starting 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a hypoxic DNA-based filtered vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using the tools, the oxygen-deprived RNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce non-harmful virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access the supercomputers from IBM, along with the cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have side effects, also called undetermined effects.
It means that it can have benefits beyond the illness it's fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines currently being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 genetically modified mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates the need for Level 3 biosafety containment measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine for MERS.
When MERS spread, it was believed that SARS-based research could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there was one vaccine for MERS (based on RNA-deoxygenated DNA) completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three other vaccines in development, all of which were virus-targeted vaccines, two gonorrhoeavirus-targeted vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-targeted vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 was already known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by many social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as the coronavirus that causes SARS.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases are mild, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people in 210 countries and territories have been reported infected, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread primarily between people during contact, often by spraying from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When sprayed during the exhalation process, it usually falls on the ground or on surfaces rather than being transmitted over long distances.
People can also get infected if they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious in the first three days of symptom onset, although it may spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the sequential polymerase reaction to the instantaneous reverse transcript (RT-PCR) by a nasal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the public use of masks vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, others saying otherwise, and others mandating their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is advised if you develop emergency symptoms of difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, disorder, difficulty waking up, or facial or lip bruising.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been noted in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China suffered only from chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports suggest that not all infected people may develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests the possibility of their contribution to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected without symptoms is currently unknown and under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases did not show symptoms during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in the daily tally on 1 April; of 166 cases infected that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.
Sponges and toys may carry a large proportion of the virus.
Talking out loud produces more splashes than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without a mouth guard can result in a spray that spreads up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it may be transmitted through aerosol, and testing samples from air collectors in the lobby outside the individual's rooms has produced positive results for viral ribosomal DNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may release respiratory secretions as a spray, which then spreads the virus through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, this risk is thought to be limited. The virus is most infectious when people are symptomatic; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can survive for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and antiseptics are also effective if used correctly; soaps melt the protective fatty membrane of the virus and stop it from working, as well as clearing the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical antiseptic), are available, but are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of testing, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
The emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its characteristics with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, household soap destroys the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most commonly affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the type II synaptic cells found in the lungs.
The virus uses a special sugar-like surface protein called spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Twelve percent of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had acute heart attacks, and it's more common in critical cases.
The rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but severe myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in its function.
Increased clotting (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%) in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 may be associated with poor prognosis. The autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 found diffuse appendixal defect (DAD), and inflammatory edema containing lymphocyte cells within the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells that express ACE2 in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete the pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to be associated with the single-cell pathogenicity of interleukin 6 in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic drainage was also reported at the autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The sequential reverse transcription polymerase reaction (RRT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually done using respiratory samples taken from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires that two blood samples be taken two weeks apart and the results have a simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70 percent.
The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first point-of-care clinical test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines from the Chongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bi-sided multi-lobed vitreous embolisms with asymmetrical and posterior diffusion are common features at the onset of the injury.
Sub-lateral spread and stone-like deposition (thickness of the physis with uneven synchronous padding) and fusion may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on the microbial lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions from the autopsy:
Microscopic examination: bronchitis, pleurisy, enlarged lungs and pleural oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, hyperplasia of the lung cells, atypical large squamous cells, and chronic inflammation with lymphatic rupture and the formation of multi-nucleated giant cells
Acute pneumonia: disseminated salivary lesions (DAD) with disseminated salivary secretions.
The diffuse syncope causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in the bronchial cavity and hypersensitivity pneumonia
Blood: diffused intra-vascular clotting (DIC); white blood cell interaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inside of the handkerchief if a tissue is not available.
It is recommended that you wash your hands thoroughly after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public, in part to reduce transmission from asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of infected people into large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings.
Social distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty, and before eating, and after cleaning their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when only soap and water are not available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizer is not readily available, the WHO offers two locally produced formulations.
The antimicrobial activity in these two compounds originates from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People get supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of those who have been hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care and pulmonary specialists in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free resource, the Critical Care Book, available online.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical specialists recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals who care for people with COVID-19, CDC recommends that a person be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to taking standard precautions, mixing precautions, and airborne precautions. CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an outbreak.
Recommended equipment: Personal protective equipment, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Respirators (instead of face masks) are preferable if available.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial facilities, but the FDA has authorized the use of masks under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is uncertain if used for other, unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using face shields, or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require ventilation or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to those with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for those in hospital is being actively studied, with some evidence of the possibility of avoiding intubation using high-flow nasal techniques or bilateral positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options will bring the same benefit to those with a critical illness or not.
Some physicians prefer to continue to use gas breathing when available because this technique reduces the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Critical cases are more common among the elderly (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for their populations, limiting the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden surge in high-risk COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilatory support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, nearly 30% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 patients and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators must have a controlled pressure and positive end-of-pipe elevated pressure modes to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory-related lung injury and chest relaxation.
The positive terminal hypertension may not be available in older respirators.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs under trial have already received approval for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with a critical illness.
The World Health Organization recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a provisional license for the use of resuscitation plasma as an experimental treatment in situations where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It hasn't been clinically tested to prove it's safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter a name and ID number.
The app can detect 'mixers' using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine but also alerts local health officials. It uses big data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence to track down those infected and those who have been mixed in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security services to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus infections.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with the infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared collected phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and virus prevention purposes.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Mr. Giulio Gallara, stated that mobile phone companies have informed him that "40% of people are still mobile everywhere".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend that had over 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kirsti Kaljuolaid, also launched a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of injury themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic stagnation are a major storm that is hurting people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may take a mild course with mild symptoms or no symptoms, in that it resembles other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more at risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. COVID-19 may affect the lungs in some people and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected individuals, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications are infections, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized were diagnosed with an anemia, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% were found to have renal dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (amine transporters).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days in the hospital.
However, for those who were transferred to the ICU, the average time between admission and death was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, and for the overall cases it ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7 percent.
Postmortem tissue pathology examinations of lung samples show widespread sinus damage with cellular fibromycin secretions in both lungs.
I observed changes in the viral cytotoxicity of the ganglion cells.
The lung imaging shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the patient is in a coma.
Heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of the region may also affect the deaths.
Estimates of deaths from the condition vary due to these differences between regions, but also because of systematic difficulties.
A reduced count of minor cases may result in an overestimation of the mortality rate from the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases of infection caused deaths may indicate that the current death rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care and die compared to non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about long-term complications.
The Hong Kong Hospital Board revealed a 20 to 30 percent shrinkage in the lung capacity of some of the recovered patients, and lung tests indicated that there was damage to it.
It can also cause post-concussive ICU syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections acquired effective and long-term immunity in patients who had recovered from the disease.
Acquired immunity is seen as a possibility, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 recovering and subsequent relapses have been reported.
He believes that these cases get worse if the infection lasts longer than if it occurs again.
He thinks the virus is natural and animal-derived, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely a result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019, was the first date for the onset of symptoms.
Official publications from the World Health Organization reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date of symptoms.
Several procedures are usually used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the screenings, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the emergency code U 07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths and U 07.2 for clinical or epidemiological COVID-19 deaths without laboratory-confirmed infection. The proportion of deaths from infections is expressed as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate from infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of those who are diagnosed with and die of a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of those who are diagnosed with and die of a disease.
These statistics have no time frame, and they follow a specific population from the injury to the fate of the case.
Although antibodies may not be produced by all infected individuals, their presence may provide information about the number of infected individuals.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castelligno d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Janglet, the disease spread through carnival festivals, and moved to young people, causing a relatively lower death rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as resulting from it.
Moreover, the German health system is not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, maybe about 3% have antibodies, according to a clinical evaluation of blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate differed between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher for men in studies done in China and Italy.
The peak risk for men is at age 50, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Gender-based immune differences, the lack of smoking prevalence among women, and men developing comorbid conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Healthcare workers, especially nurses, are more likely to be women, and they are at increased risk of infection.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that Ku is an acronym for corona, and VIRUS is an acronym for DIS and 19 is an acronym for DIS, which refers to the year the outbreak was first discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international naming recommendations that aim to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public data.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of the names novel coronavirus-2019 and novel coronavirus-associated acute respiratory illness-2019 as temporary names for virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of place names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The two official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export healthcare items such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier couldn't deliver it on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and delivered the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories and misinformation and misinformation regarding the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.
In March, the WHO launched the Solidarity Trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that have the most promising efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively working to develop candidate vaccines.
It draws on previous studies of SARS-CoV because it is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three pollination strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, is intended to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the molecular vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain virus molecules.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the SpikeS protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (spore-forming DNA or RNA-RNA vaccines, a new technique for vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines produced by any of these strategies should be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless transcribed genetic code from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials in progress as of April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved malaria treatments have been evaluated, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Proposed antiviral drugs for reuse in the new treatment make up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III trials of Remdesivir across several countries due to report results by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs was conducted as of April 2020. Several antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/retonavir, and lopinavir/retonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence of efficacy of Remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with Remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
With that, there are calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virology Research points out that although a dose of 1 gram is recommended, too much of this dose is extremely dangerous and can cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians for those with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or omifenofer for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms was recommended after its demonstrated inhibition of low-concentration SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that primary spike protein conformation by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) was required for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies involving chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have shown significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may represent one of the complications of late-stage acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. The National Health Commission of China added tolizumab to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
It is undergoing a non-randomized Phase 2 national trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe medical conditions.
In addition to its use in serum ferritin testing to identify cytokine storms, it is intended to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
The Food and Drug Administration adopted interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, chemoreceptor T-cell therapy, based on regression case studies for the treatment of steroid-responsive cytokine excretion syndrome with a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no clinical evidence that tosylizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The method of transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive inoculation.
This strategy was tested on SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Viral neutralization represents the predicted mechanism of action by which negative antibody therapy can act as a defense mediator against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms may be employed such as antibody-based cytotoxicity, glutamate or both.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Production of methylenine serum, which is the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased to spread it more rapidly.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Lee Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
