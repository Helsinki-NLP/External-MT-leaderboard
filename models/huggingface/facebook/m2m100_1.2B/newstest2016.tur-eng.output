Professor Confesses He Killed His Girlfriend By Calling 911
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police should come to the houses, only in a bit of trembling voice.
Lamb said his “loved dog” was alive and probably sad, and that the family’s phones could be on the woman’s mobile phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss's untouched body at home and a handwritten note on a white notebook: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could get it all back, I loved Amy so much and she was the only woman who loved me so far," officials said.
There was no finding that Lamb, who taught two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already taken 300 miles toward the school campus where he thought the beloved history professor of the police, Ethan Scmidt, was also shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard gunfire at 10:18.
Lamb’s invasive 911 call was announced shortly afterwards.
At the end of the day another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
One day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, officials were still investigating what prompted Lamb to do so.
The details drawn out by the investigators on both sides of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, depicted a talented but possibly problematic teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to entering his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal and criminal records.
Schmidt even referred to Lamb in a book he wrote as one of the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both of them taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students taught from both.
However, there were also signs that there were mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke of Lamb’s praise, noted that he is also an anxious and stressed person and appears to “have a problem.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for medical permission from Delta State University, stating that he had some health problems.
This year, there were two lessons on the Internet.
Recent changes to the university’s recruitment policies did not automatically guarantee that Lamb would be a staff faculty member despite the doctorate he worked hard to earn.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious that there were some things in Lamb's mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was empty, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Justice Investigation Director Methel Johnson revealed that his family committed suicide with a single 38 caliber gun in the back yard of a house about 1.5 km away from his home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, before Lamb was arrested.
Lamb’s car was found working on the highway.
Although it is not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in the house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at a 3,500 student university in a city of approximately 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and gave classes in geography and education.
He received his doctorate in the field of education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun man.
When Carla Hairston met through fellow friends, she said she was 15, and Lamb was 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice guy who tried to teach them how to play guitar for several years.
He was the one who beat his hearts fast.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon City, told Lamb, “All the girls would melt when he came.”
Lamb and Prentiss seem to have been together for a while.
In the 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there is no official record of their marriage.
In their brick houses on the banks of a river in Gautier, they had a dog named Lightning who lived with them.
Police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss’ ex-husband Shawn O’Steen said they divorced 15 years ago but they’ve always been friends with Prentiss and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also said her daughter was completely destroyed.
He and his mother were wonderful friends.
O'Steen said she never met Lamb but heard her daughter Abigail tell her Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail went on stage at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together in general shows.
O'Steen said her daughter wrote and said the music herself.
Prentiss was a nurse working in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a loose bar near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss were last seen on the night of September 5 after Lamb had finished playing guitar and violin to a handful of audiences.
There was no sign that there was a problem.
They said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut off and tossed each other a row.
They both had a great joke.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, noted that the murdered professor Schmidt was leading a first-class seminar program and was an expert on Native American and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also chairman of a student solidarity group he founded.
About 900 people attended the candlestick ceremony on the Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, including academics, university staff, students and visitors from locals.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the commemoration ceremony, where the university choir sang the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Wonderful Charity".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
LaForge said, “We’re trying to get our students back.”
The crisis is over.
Time for wounds.

Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) contributed to the news.
This news text was corrected to reflect the fact that the police stated that Lamb was calling 911 after killing Schmidt, and that there was no official evidence that the two had been married, although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his "wife" in the 911 call.
Toys R Us Plans to Buy Fewer Holiday Season Elements
Toys R Us has announced that it will not hire more holiday workers this year than it did last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer has said it will allow more opportunities for existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most work will be part-time.
The company said talks with candidates will begin this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While there are still months to the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to equip their stores and help them sell, ship and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox has made stories about his "relation" with Princess Diana
“Back to the Future” is a great film for Michael J. Fox.
It was very important for personal reasons.
In his documentary, “Back in Time,” he said: “We were waiting for the members of the royal family to come in the cinema, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The movie started and I noticed that dating with the Welsh Princess was a false stretch and arm stretch away from me.
Back in Time, a documentary about the film, includes interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and practitioner producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was first seen 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “This is the most exciting time travel film I’ve ever made.
In addition to back in time VOD and DVD formats, it will also be shown in some outstanding cinemas.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Speaking about Russia’s increasing military support to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the Syrian problem that has lasted for five years “cannot be solved by military intervention” and that more weapons will just be more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and hold constructive talks to find a political solution to the problem.
At a press conference held on Wednesday, Ban said at the U.N. General Assembly meeting, which will be held towards the end of the month, the five permanent council members planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France on Syria.
The Council expressed its deep regret that the division between its members and the Syrian people has "made the problem insoluble" by regional forces.
Ban also called on the five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis, as in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Survey Figures That Prove Donald Trump Is Serious
Some tried to label it as a volcano.
Others spoke to him as if he was joking.
And some are supporting the internal explosion.
While some Republicans have tried to pull Donald Trump down in polls, it (still) hasn’t worked.
The latest 11 national polls have shown him to lead Donald Trump in double-digit numbers, and some are seriously starting to ask about his chance of being the real estate emperor’s candidate.
Of course, it’s too early for the election.
None of this means that Trump can win the Republican candidacy.
Experts say that Rick Perry’s rise during these periods in 2011 also caused Herman Cain to rise, both of whom failed to win the nomination process in even one state.
There are a lot of reasons why it will be difficult in general elections.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC group and the Economic Conservative Growth Club are realizing Trump’s lasting power and start spending their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results that show that the real estate emperor is not just coming and coming:
Trump’s preference rates have changed 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at Monmouth University shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion for his real estate emperor.
By mid-July this was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of ten people have negative opinions.
And these numbers look up in early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa, showed that 60 percent of Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be happy with Trump’s nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “hopeful” if Trump were elected.
Only two out of 10 people said that they would "repair" if he was nominated.
Only Ben Carson creates the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be “enthusiastic” and 40 percent for Trump).
The nearest person?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they “will not expect” or “will do better” if Jeb Bush, the organization’s favorite, is elected.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s humor as a problem.
While Donald Trump is criticized for his slanderous language and humiliation, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post polls, 52 percent of Republicans surveyed believe the real estate emperor has the right mood to be president.
The same figure is true in Iowa, where the country’s first party council will be held, where 52 percent of Republicans believe he will be the leader, according to Quinnipac last week.
Still, 44 percent think they don’t have the personality to effectively serve, and six out of 10 independent respondents say his humor doesn’t fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they wear their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best.
Four out of 10 people have invested their money in Jeb Bush since the end of July.
Full Disclosure: In the past, the crystal globe of GOP voters was not very clear.
In the last election round of that period, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would run, while only 28 percent had voted for Mitt Romney, who was the ultimate candidate.
Still, it seems that the majority of GOP voters find Trump's election campaign prone to mind.
Even if Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the confusing area could also contribute to Trump’s prominence, and it’s a fact that anti-Trump support is scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll conducted in early September suggests that in the event of a possible match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump has gained the support of the majority every time.
Carly Fiorina scores 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points each.
with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to be defeated?
In the event of a possible single, Ben Carson surpasses businessman with 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll released on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who supported Trump said they locked their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change this, and nobody can really say that they won’t change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to change candidates.
Trump’s biggest rival is still brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve made their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
In his campaign announcement speech two months ago, since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent,” the theme at the beginning and center of his 2016 talks has been immigration.
Some think that Trump’s too much speech has removed key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and would hurt their re-branding efforts.
But a new ABC/Post poll on Monday found that six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration-related issues.
As long as the issue of immigration remains on the agenda, Trump will remain on the agenda.
The anger against the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson get roughly half of the Republican votes due to their predominantly external circumstances.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they want someone from outside instead of someone with government experience.
They are angry with Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll conducted in Iowa found that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were angry with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were “unconscious” and 21 percent were “excessively angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn will be in office for the first time.
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn’s appearance on the Prime Minister’s Questions program has been eagerly anticipated.
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will appear for the first time after David Cameron in the Prime Minister’s Questions Corps.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly afternoon, and his performance seems to be closely reviewed by the media and Labour Party MEPs.
In the weekly show, he called for "less theatre and more reality".
He also said he could jump off some of his sessions by leaving it to his colleagues.
This encounter will be Mr Corbyn’s first parliamentary test of leadership, followed by his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party’s leader’s silence at a commemoration ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday while reading the national march was also criticized by some Tory MEPs and focused on front-page news in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision to accompany me to the national march
A spokesman speaking on behalf of Mr Corbyn said he stood in "respectful silence" and appreciated "the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle of England."
But Owen Smith, one of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet members, told BBC News Two that he would advise the Labour Party leader to speak nationally as “independent” of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
About a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team due to differences in economy, defense and foreign affairs, while less than one in six in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political reporter Robin Brant noted that the political differences within the Labour Party have also begun to "scale" and these are issues of Mr. Corbyn's appointment over the position in the European Union and the government's application of a ceiling on aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party proposed new changes to completely remove the ceiling.
Hours later, Shadow Work and Retirement Minister Mr. Smith said he was "very clear" about this, saying he was opposed to the party just reducing the government's upper limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to meet in the House of Representatives since David Cameron became the Conservative Party leader.
The Labour Party leader promised a different approach to politics, saying he was "popularly sourced" and received more than 30,000 advice to ask Mr. Cameron.
MEP Islington North told the Prime Minister that the Questions program is very front-facing and will focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people instead of making an inspiring promise exchange with “cultivating responses.”
Mr. Corbyn told the Prime Minister in his Questions program that he would be represented by shadow trade minister Angela Eagle when he wasn’t there, for example when Mr. Cameron was traveling abroad.
He even occasionally suggested that his other colleagues would go to the court, and said he had appealed to Avam Chamber spokesman John Bercow to address the matter.
When he became the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron often expressed his desire to move away from politics in the style of the "Kukla Game" associated with the Prime Minister's Questions program, but he admitted that he failed to do so a few years later.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions program has been used as a key measure to measure the decision-making capabilities of leaders, their dominance in the House of Representatives and their positions among Members of Parliament; in turn, some critics have stated that this is caricaturized and requires very comprehensive reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youths get photography training
The city centre of Johannesburg is a challenging place for the homeless.
But a group of old street children have found a way to gain a new talent and survive.
I retired in Joburg, a non-profit studio that taught homeless youth to take photos of their neighborhoods and make income from them.
He went to meet one of the first graduates of the BBC News project.

The pound is rising as wage increases accelerate in the UK
While data showing wage increases in the UK saw a rapid rise in the pound, the FTSE 100 index also rose following the purchase offer for SABMiller.
In the UK, salaries excluding premiums increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for potential interest rate increases.
The pound gained more than 1% in value against the U.S. dollar to $1,5505, while the euro gained 0.84%, to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 percent to 6.229.21 points.
The most prominent company in this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase with an attractive purchase offer from its competitor AB InBev.
The offer will bring together the world’s two largest beer companies, and brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9 percent following positive profit news from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont’s current sales figures showed that it has surpassed expectations, as well as that sales have started to rise again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry.
Mining giant Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after it announced that it had earned $2.5 billion from the company’s sale of allocated shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most valuable shares after Goldman Sachs lowered its proposal for the company to "Sat" with a loss of value of 4.3%.
JD Sports’ shares rose by 3.1% after it announced that the company’s six-month pre-tax profit rose by 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Chairman Peter Cowgill said higher minimum wages for UK workers could mean “more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But he said that his spending power would not surpass the high costs of his company’s employees.
He also added that the costs would affect JD Sports’ expansion plans and that this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launches public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash has launched a popular campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi is preparing to open its first of two distribution centers and stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and trying to build the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide Fair.
IGA vendors and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer Simmo, which offers flavor testing in IGA stores, and with store owners selling discounted South Australia football league tickets to their loyal customers.
Food, beverage and hardware wholesaler Metcash is expected to provide more details about its defence strategy as the annual investor strategy day is fixed on September 29.
The risk is high, as South Australia and Western Australia account for 30% of Metcash’s IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australia and Western Australia store owners are negatively narrowed and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they have in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30 percent more in GA in the eastern states and 24 percent more in BA.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take over about 5% of the market within 12 months of opening its first stores in these two states, with sales coming from existing players but generally from retailers without a parent.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on Aldi’s estimate that next year it will open 25 stores in GA and 30 stores in BA, earning $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr Kierath noted that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash’s high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million in interest and pre-tax earnings.
Also, despite a recent study by Roy Morgan that revealed that IGA customers are the most loyal customers, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and market sales will decline by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, bringing its market share down from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder, chief fund manager Hamish Douglass, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash “may most likely be erased in ten years.”
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass’s comments.
But it turns out that a member of the Metcash board contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18% since 2010 to 14%, and Metcash’s profits from food and market business, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have dropped by 43% since 2012, indicating that the business leverage rate has decreased as sales and margins are under pressure.
But wholesalers resist, investing more than $150 million a year at Coles and Woolworths for matching shelf prices each week, helping IGA retailers renovate their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and opening up a better custom-labeled market series to the public.
Ian Morrice, chairman of the Metcash executive board, says price matching and store renewal programs have begun to yield results and that wholesalers are expected to return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves much praise from criticism for his behavior.
Tennis Australia chairman Steve Healy said Thanasi Kokkinakis' friend Nick Kyrgios was on the side of the accident in the last storm that broke around him and deserves much praise from criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented pair, usually referred to as the “Special Ks,” found himself under the unwelcome spotlights because of Kyrgios’ face-to-face crushing Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a challenging elementary match played in Cincinnati in the afternoon, while Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison were twice separated by the file referee, Harrison made a statement: "Wawrinka came over Kyrgios and I have to go over that boy."
Kokkinakis, who was seen crashing his rocket at the recent US Open to potentially disappoint Richard Gasquet, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young actor is currently competing for the second single role behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semi-final with Sam Groth in Glasgow.
Healy said, “What I feel very enthusiastically is that I think that Thanasi is a bit drawn to debate.”
He broke his rocket when he closed in the US and lost it, but he wasn’t the first player to break the rocket because he was disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn’t be proud of it.
But in reality, in the U.S., Harrison and others did quite well under extremely provocative circumstances, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He has a great team around him, a wonderful family, and I think he’s gone a little too far.
Although he is 19 years old, he is extremely mature, he works hard and adapts to the team, he has no problems with other players, he is received with full respect in the dressing room, he has tough workouts, he is a highly balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own edges.
Healy also supported his decision to please Kyrgios for a significant joint; starting Friday, he began explaining that what was right for everyone was to “make mutual decisions” but support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term racer.
Healy said: “We want the team to focus on the game, not the fight around [Kyrgios] in the first place.
And in my opinion, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have also pointed out, the child grew up very fast, he grows in front of the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received, but we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he is not under the spotlights, he thinks deeply that my thought is appropriate, that the team and himself are the best.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and takes immigrants into consideration
Hungary declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to close its southern border with Serbia in order to stop the flow of migrants and to keep an eye on those trying to enter the country through illegal routes.
With hundreds of migrants gathering in the neutral zone, chaos was created at the border and Serbian officials acted furiously.
Immigrants fleeing violence in their own countries for an indefinite period of time set up tents along the road between the control points of the two countries and settled in these tents.
But their anger increased.
As a police helicopter passed from above, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian agile force police.
Some refused to receive food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister has said that while the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continues, Hungary’s return of migrants is “unacceptable”.
He wants to be a part of the solution, not a part of the process.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will need to be held in the coming days," Dacic said in Prague.
The tensions on the Hungarian-Serbian border came just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who have attacked Greece and Italy and hoped to reach an agreement by the end of next month or year to accept another 120,000 migrants, including those from Hungary.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a EU summit next week to address the continent’s migrant crisis.
Hungary is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbors will take any concrete steps on the matter.
The emergency call issued on Tuesday in the two southern regions gives authorities extensive powers to tackle the crisis, including closing roads if necessary and accelerating asylum cases.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he planned to pull the rubber wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from this country after the rubber wire the country pulled to the border with Serbia.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons were deployed to work on clay wires between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major narrow passage and transit point to European Union countries, and most of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the immigrants are “economic immigrants” who are trying to move to Europe for a better life than innocent people who are coming to escape the war – a view that is completely contrary to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, bring harsher penalties for human smugglers as well as making it a crime to cross or damage a 4 meter (13 feet) long clay wire pulled to the Serbian border.
In a statement to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government declares a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass migration."
One thing is clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
While the military deployment has yet to be approved by parliament, Associated Press reporters in the region have said they have seen soldiers carrying dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons here for days.
Orban’s domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 15 people who had crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border.
They passed by damaging the wire and are now charged with committing crimes under the police’s supervision and under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly repairing the rubber wires.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while using a train wagon covered with clay wires to close one of the crossing points.
With the Hungarians deploying a small metal container in which people were crushed to carry out the operations, the chaos also reflected the main border crossing near Roszke.
20 people were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by closing the highway linking Serbia and Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's superiority over Bernie Sanders halved in national elections
Former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to lead the Democratic race for the national candidacy, but Sen. Bernie Sanders runs on her.
Clinton currently gets 47% of the Democrats' votes (falling from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15 percent of the Democratic votes.
Longer than five months before the main races began, most Democratic voters said it was still too early to decide which candidate they would support.
But Clinton’s supporters have stronger ideas about their own elections than other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton has been losing ground among a number of demographic groups, with Sanders having some gains on the other hand.
Clinton is at the forefront with a huge difference between women and moderates, but this difference is closed.
His support among the men has dropped considerably and Sanders is following him only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s Democratic voter advantage under the age of 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now in equal position.
But Clinton has a big difference in terms of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sander with two seats among the liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead in this group.
Nearly half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would be passionate about supporting Clinton if the party were to be the candidate.
A quarter supports under certain conditions, while another 15 percent will support him only if he is a candidate.
Six percent of voters do not support Clinton.
Per not surprisingly at all, Clinton’s current supporters tend to support her especially with passion.
Opinions among those who don’t support Clinton at the moment are even more confusing – only a quarter can passionately support her.
48 percent of Democrats say they will passionately support Clinton, while less Republican-leading candidates talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked open-ended questions about why they wanted Clinton to be a candidate, the first-ranked answers were in the direction that she had the right experience (16 percent), the idea that it was now time for a woman to elect president (13 percent), and the idea that she was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also express her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Being conciliatory in problems and being able to choose among the specified criteria.
As a vice president with potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters may want to see him in the race, but a third of the party does not think that way.
When Democratic voters were asked what the second candidate election for the party was, Biden was at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters, according to Sander, say Biden could clearly be a second election.
If Biden doesn’t enter the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton’s superiority to Sanders increases; Biden’s level of 20 points in a race that doesn’t include Biden rises to 30 points.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that figure fell from 78 percent last month to that level.
While Biden is second in this regard, he is far behind, but the percentage of those who see him as the most eligible candidate has increased.
Once again, when asked what is the most important thing in an election, Democratic voters hold the issues ahead of eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic voter candidate or candidate appears to be unacceptable for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their own parties.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as people who are honest and trustworthy, as well as with strong leadership qualities.
Biden ranks first among the three in terms of honesty while Clinton is strong in terms of leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, and half say the same for Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent have no idea about it.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
In all criteria, a quarter of Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions about the use of personal email addresses and servers during the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are ongoing, most Democratic voters find the explanation on the subject satisfactory and say that their views on it have not been affected.
But this is a different story in the general American public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his statements, while only one-third find them satisfactory.
Public opinions on this issue were divided in March, shortly after the issue was taken under scrutiny.
Most Americans say e-mail disputes don’t affect their general views about Clinton, while 36 percent say they have increased their negative opinions.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six out of 10 say their views on Clinton are distorted.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by its party’s voters, it’s still a general problem among registered voters: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not find it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have good notes on leadership.
Among the six candidates who took part in the test, Biden, Carson and Bush got the best scores on honesty.
More often finds Sanders honest, but as with Carson, most do not have an idea about him.
The margin of error in the sample of 351 Democrats voters was 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson runs close behind Donald Trump
The new poll shows that about half of the voters of the two candidates matched the game, the other candidates had little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising from 23 percent in the last CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent in the poll released on Tuesday.
But support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson also performed quite well in demographic groups, with college graduate Republican voter support much higher than Trump.
The rest, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropped from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The latest poll, which included 376 Republican voters, had a 6% error margin and was conducted in September.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson's support among Republicans rose to 19 percent, just behind Trump's 32 percent support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump seriously in front of Carson.
Faced with Carson’s rise last week, Trump continued to randomly shake his retired brain surgeon even though he apologized for questioning Carson’s belief.
At a campaign stop in Iowa last Saturday, Trump said “we need energy.”
Five Brotherhood members accused of killing first-class student at Baruch College
Murder cases were opened against five people almost two years after the death of a college student during an admission ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brotherhood brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a launch ceremony in September 2013 and, according to police, contributed to his death by delaying his transportation to the hospital.
Officials that his eyes were tied, he was attached to the back of a backpack filled with 30 pounds of sand, and he was constantly attached to a hammer while trying to walk toward the target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that he had a headache over time and later lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fell ill and, according to police, waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But police commissioner Chris Wagner, speaking at the press conference, said that in the meantime, they changed Deng's clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google, and asked for advice by contacting the national president of the brotherhood, Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner said at this point members began to hide personal belongings and highlighted the goodness of brotherhood from Michael Deng.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered trauma from repeated shocks with an unsharp body on his head, body and hip.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement that many families have collapsed as a result of the Brotherhood’s admission ceremonies, with at least one student losing their lives every year since 1970.
Brotherhood and members should be held accountable for this and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe City recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with the reception ceremony and punishment for the attack.
Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday, we will hold them accountable not only for those who are involved in the matter, but also if an organization has officially or indirectly confirmed it.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood also ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With the rise of interest rates, the bull market is stagnant, and debt revenues are rising, and the economy is receding.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will happen and how long it will continue.
History, especially in economics, offers very little information about timing.
The recession lasted as long as 86 months, as the recession took place in just 11 months after the initial interest rate rise.
The U.S. Central Bank’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates has often been decisive in the reaction of the economy and financial assets, although not constantly.
This is why U.S. central bank officials strongly emphasize that investors should not focus on when interest rates start to rise, but how long the normalization process will take.
It is a fact that there are various variables.
But in the end, market participants may think that the anxiety about interest rate increases is exaggerated.
In a note to clients, Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop said, “It is inevitable that the Fed’s first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis is interpreted as indicating by some that the ‘cheap money’ period is coming to an end.”
On the contrary, we don’t expect U.S. interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it seems to have been a seismic shock that many of the levels that are still low fear.
We cannot say there will be no effects.
Based on past trends, the reaction that some sectors of the economy can give is as follows:
As has been seen in the market in recent months, waiting for interest rates to rise can imbalance some things for a while.
Even when the rate is increased, the effect is not so apparent.
In a new survey of what will happen after the Fed raises, Deutsche Bank analysts said, “Return on equity returns appear to be a stalling trend for 12-24 months after the first rate hike, which may reflect a stall in monetary policy.”
According to a recent analysis shared by Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management analysts at Barron's, the market has typically seen sharp rise over the past 35 years — about 14 percent — and progressed in a straight line toward interest rate increases after 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent) and returned to normal after 500 days, generating an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the effect on the shares was more pronounced in the subsequent stages of the interest rate-raising cycle and the yield was facing disappearance.
Recessions are a reality of economic life, but interest rate increases also help them.
The Fed, in its current state, is facing some situations that are not previously present and will accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable is that the purely domestic yield is at the lowest level to date for the Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the rise in the interest rate of 118 since 1950 has dropped from nominal year to nominal net domestic income only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, the Atlanta Fed says it is expected to be lasting by very few, looking at the third quarter at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment could be risky and could lead to the question “will it be different this time?”
Market participants, who have been waiting for the Fed’s interest rate hike for a year, pay attention this week at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could confirm an increase at this meeting, the long-term trade indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our research since 1950, all growth cycles that have occurred to this day are in a super-upward trend cycle, rapidly reaching peak levels before recession after starting recovery,” the report said.
Rather, this was an unprecedented slow recovery of the worst recession that has occurred in an exemplary period.
The current cycle was the longest cycle the Fed has expected since the last recession – the longest cycle in the record was 35 months, and the cycle we’ve been in is in the 74th month and it’s still going on.
With the expectation of interest rate increases in the market, the income has become unstable and the arrangement looks like an asset.
The main difference is that when the Fed changes the course of policy, the effect is seen faster on bonds than on stocks.
When the first increase / decrease of the cycle comes, the bond yields do not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle, bond yields are falling instantly,” Deutsche said.
According to strategy experts Charles Schwab, interest rate increases will align the trend by approaching the yields between longer and shorter-term bonds.
We told Kathy Jones of Schwab analysts that high-yielded bonds often perform better in such an environment in the analysis, but “we’re still cautious about reaching yield.”
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapting to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the decline in the dollar’s strength and inflationary expectations, there are various signals that the market is being regulated by a tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, yield curve is steady, credit spreads have expanded, and volatility has increased – all the features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tightenes its policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will gain because interest rates will rise and local products will be more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, as rising dollar products will make them more expensive in the global market, and their debt will be even more expensive.
In a report prepared by Goldman Sachs analysts for their customers, they said, “History shows that ‘quality’ stocks may experience a decline in performance at the beginning of such a rise.”
Companies with strong balance sheets surpassed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent following growth in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatile shares also outperformed their low-quality competitors (percentage) by an average of 4 to (percentage).
Borrowing will be a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with high wave rate debt are likely to suffer the most losses.
In addition to the clean stock game, consumers are also expected to benefit from rising dollars.
While experts have different opinions about how fast to keep it, savers can also profit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham says BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham accuses station of ‘getting bad’
He argued that the radio was becoming different from its commercial competitors.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused her of rubbing the Brit Awards.
Deputy friend Damien Collins accuses The Voice of not being original
A prominent deputy pressured the broadcaster to reveal its difference to other commercial stations by saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly “turning back to Classic FM.”
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC’s public-service radio channel is “depleting” and becoming increasingly different from its commercial competitors.
“I don’t like to use this term, but Radio 3 is ‘different’ and is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also attended the BBC Music Awards last year.
The BBC Music Awards were launched last year.
Bingham said, “So if you’re trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, while you’re copying what’s already on the market.”
The BBC Director-General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of commercial competitors in terms of live music and public education.
If I learn from Radio 3, I won’t go and learn anything about classical music from anywhere else.
And that’s a commitment to live music, and making music can’t compare to anything else.
He also said that I think Radio 3’s efforts to discover new music and promote its work are very important.
BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey claimed earlier this year that radio needs to work more than it did in the past in order to reach more listeners, because Britons are less educated in the field of classical music.
However, Radio 3 wasn’t the only component to hold the ball because of the BBC’s push to the tail of commercial rivals at the Culture, Media and Sports Selection Committee meeting.
MEP Tory Damien Collins also summoned O Ses to the BBC's music talent competition, which he received £22 million in copyright from Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can’t you see why the program brings so much sound, because it’s not original and there’s no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was led by the jury of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was "made with an emblem specific to the BBC."
He said the organization wanted him to "find a hit from his own blood" before making the entertainment program again.
However, he did not accept the idea of preventing the production of more O Audio programs in the future or spending the amount spent on the license fee on other formats.
Black Friday was the lowest online sales increase in August.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by seven percent.
Last month recorded the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to be broken
Internet sales exploded three years ago when mobile devices began to be used in shopping
Experts point out that Black Friday in November may be the reason for spending cuts
Online shopping has been exploding for more than a decade, turning Britain’s busiest shopping streets into a ghost town.
After figures showing an increase of only seven percent in online sales in the first three months of 2015, experts note that online sales are showing more and more signs of weakening.
Total spending in August increased by just five percent from last year, the lowest growth since the year 2000, when records began to break.
Following figures showing an increase of only seven percent in online sales in the first three months of 2015, experts note that online sales are showing more and more signs of weakening.
Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian: “If you look at the growth levels of previous years, and especially the 2000s, you’ll actually see that over time everything is back to normal.”
He added that three years ago, when consumers started using their mobile phones to buy products, internet sales saw a huge rise.
This meant that even more people could shop while lying on the seat.
But now it is going horizontally, you can see the (growing) descent.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is shown to be one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts say consumers may expect this event to take place on the last Friday of November to buy something.
At last year’s event, many companies’ websites crashed when five times more consumers attacked companies’ websites to catch cheap products compared to the previous year.
Experts point out that Black Cube shoppers, showing that shoppers are struggling for discounts, may have been "for now" overwhelmed
A study published by the British Retailers’ Association found that 1 pound of every £5 spent on shopping is spent on buying products online.
A third of certain products, such as TVs and laundry machines, are now purchased from online stores.
More than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online instead of on luxurious and spectacular shopping streets.
With the conviction of the family of Bin Laden, Muslims congratulate the last travels of those who lost their lives in the vine accident in Mecca
The remains of 29 people who lost their lives after the first funerals in Mecca were moved on the streets by Muslims.
Saudi Arabia holds construction giant Saudi Binladin group responsible for the crash
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the fall of the vincin.
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to carry the carcasses of 29 people who lost their lives in the fall of a vincin into the Mosque of Haram.
The crowd, mostly white, shut down their roads to say goodbye to their first funerals at the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
The sorrowful crowd passed through the sacred place a few days ago, where the ceiling of a Vincin mosque was torn down and the woods were overthrown.
At the same time, there were also 394 wounded, after the family of Binladin, the owner of the Saudi kingdom’s construction holding, was held accountable, the bodies of the dead were brought to be demolished.
The wounds of the 29 people who died in the fall of a vincin into the Mosque of Haram moved on their shoulders along the way.
Among the dead was November Akram, a father of four children from the Bolton district of Manchester, who was in the first stroke when the wreck fell.
Mr. Akram had come to the Mosque of Haram with his parents at the beginning of the annual Hach worship.
Saudi leaders have announced that Hatsun will continue with the participation of thousands of hacks on their way to Mecca.
In his speech today, King Salman announced that the Binladin Holding Group should not leave the vinyl arm open while out of use.
In the Arab version of the bill, which was prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, it was stated that the only party to be charged with the incident was the Binladin Group.
The news agency's English-language service did not pass on this detail, but to the company's officials that the ban was brought abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed that he would find a reason for his invasion to the courtyard of the Mosque-i-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived at the end of the month.
The Binladin group did not make any statements about the overthrown winch and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The Royal Farm accused the group of not taking current security measures and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
In Mecca, the mosque is surrounded by dozens of vineyards, most of which areined by the government of the group of Binladin.
Binladin’s family has been in close ties with Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and is the head of most construction projects.
The last leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was also a deviant son whom the family banned from childhood.
The accident occurred just a few days before millions flocked to the land of Ha'a, where every adult Muslim was supposed to visit at least once in his life, during a period of heavy wind and rain.
Officials said 158 people are still being treated in hospitals.
Authorities ordered compensation of 1 million rials (£174,000) to the families of the deceased and those who survived permanent disability.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q chief says cheap-working Eastern European craftsmen are behind this trend
Veronique Laury says Brits are hiring more and more staff
Behind this increase lies the number of Eastern European craftsmen.
As a result, another 200 new Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen are opened
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Rupert Steiner, City Chief Reporter of the Daily Mail
Britons are said to have started hiring skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do their homework instead of leaving their hamsters and paint brushes in their hands.
If you are skilled in using hammer or painting walls, you are in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, Brits are hiring more and more masters to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, owner of the home repair chain, said there is a huge increase in the number of skilled Eastern European craftsmen offering services at low prices behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is closing its 60 B&Q stores and plans to open another 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store were given by women.
Most of the staff are now men.
She said that the home of single women who have done more home improvements than in the past is a need to meet the emerging demographic trends seen.
Mrs. Laury said: “Mostly men still work in our stores.
We need to make more balances.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80% of the decisions about purchased products are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laury, one of the five women at the head of Britain’s leading firms index FTSE100, has also restructured its top team to consist of an equal number of male and female executives.
Kingfisher, including its chief executive and chief financial officer, is almost alone in this field, with 50 percent of its team made up of women.
Ms. Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women in our management board.
After the group charged the cost of closed stores, Kingfisher announced a drop in both six-month profit and sales.
Kingfisher, the owner of Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores
U.S. Central Bank Decides Time to Raise Fed Interest Rate
The U.S. Central Bank’s two-day meetings on Wednesday and Thursday are being watched worldwide, and a decision is expected to be made about whether or not interest rates will be raised in the next decade.
In a Reuters survey, a little more than half of the economists said the Fed would implement the decision last week, but now they think it will suspend the decision and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
Seven years have passed since the Fed cut rates to zero.
Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson International Economic Institute, said: “For the first time, we will witness a major central bank coming out of the zero and starting the process of normalizing interest rates.”
The U.S. economy is performing relatively well, and the recovery of the economy adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and creates a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less promising global picture.
Markets have warned against a rise, but there are signs that they believe that the situation will not allow such a rise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
The murder file at Delta State University left an apology letter
According to officials on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note saying she was "in order" for the first murder on Monday morning after killing her girlfriend with a gun in Mississippi and before killing her coworker in the advancing hours of the same day, and wishing "I could take it back."
Mississippi Gautier police said Lamb, a geography and social science instructor at Delta State University, called 911 at 10 p.m.
He said on Monday that he was shot and killed.
Lamb said the officer on the phone should send the police.
Lamb, who said “I killed my wife last night,” also noted that there was a “sweet dog that didn’t hurt anyone” in the house and was probably sad.
When the police asked the caller’s name, he did not say his name.
Lamb did not give any explanation about the murder.
When police went to the scene, they encountered the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could have taken time back.
I loved Amy so much and she was the only person who loved me so far.
After writing this note, Lamb drove his car to the Delta State, 300 miles away, and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, after which he committed suicide as police struck him.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious that there were some things in Lamb's mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss had an emotional relationship with Schmidt, officials said Tuesday they had "no information or evidence" in their hands that it was a "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good guy."
The couple divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said they had a 19-year-old daughter with Prentiss, and the girl was "broken."
O’Steen also noted that Prentiss and her daughter are “absolutely each other’s best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowless, who was described by Sun Herald as a close friend of Parentiss, Prentiss was working on the Internet from home.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunter named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about 3 years.
Knowles said, “He’s always loved helping others.”
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday and said "I won't go to jail."
That same night, when police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled aside, jumped as a stone, ran toward the forest area, and committed suicide by shooting himself with a gun.
According to the CV published on the university’s website, Lamb received the title of Doctor of Education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The stars who lost their charm
The actor seen with his son Redmond (right) had a rather stressful couple of years.
He fought with leukemia in 2001, and in 2009 he killed his life mate Farrah Fawcett from cancer.
The actor, who allegedly fought with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
Of course, all this hurt him very much.
Luke Shaw is out of Manchester United for two months.
Luke Shaw’s right leg suffered two fractures in a match where Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
This incident drowned his defense player in tears, leaving him off the pitch for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal Shaw remains hopeful that he can return to the pitch this season.
In the 15th minute of the match, when 20-year-old Shaw fell on the pitch like a bomb, the break was caused by his careless interference with Héctor Moreno.
He was intervened in the field for nine minutes and then needed oxygen before being transported to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He’s broken his leg and is now in the hospital.”
Today or a day later, he may be transferred to Manchester for surgery.
It’s a terrible situation – a young man who is transferred to Manchester at the age of 18, first has a hard time, then a great game, and then that happens.
He had an oxygen mask on his face.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you’ve broken off the double, it means at least six months, and it means you won’t be able to play at the group level.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky enough to get rid of the red card and the penalty shot.
The judge did not punish the Mexican Nicola Rizzoli.
Van Gaal argued that the Italian authorities made a mistake.
When I say this is a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a terrible fight with two legs.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, there are no words to describe how disappointed I am, my path of healing begins now, I will come back stronger.”
Related: Manchester United PSV defeat Luke Shaw experiences the shock of his injury
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be moral for the British defense player’s recovery.
PSV technical director Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
If such an injury happens to any player, everyone will be sad.
The intention of our players is never to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture while playing for the Mexican team of Van Gaal against the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
Cocu said he finds this very difficult because his intention was never to hurt his opponent, and it wasn’t good after he heard it was a very bad break.
In my opinion, I could not see that moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction, as if Moreno had touched him, but I couldn’t see Luke’s play.
In SBS 6, Moreno said: “I know what it’s like, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it and I am very sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was hospitalized as a result of a fight with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax.
This is something that every parent soon learns: When your child loves a book, you know it will not take much time for you to learn it almost.
It looks like you’re not David Cameron.
When asked what his favorite children’s book was by a holiday programming provider for childcare, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s 1971 environmental tale.
In a statement posted on the SuperCamps website, Cameron said: “I love reading this book with a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message to my children because it contains an image or message we’ve always jumped in.”
Everything went very well until Cameron wrote something about the contents of the book but actually added new characters and details to inflate the contents of the original storytelling to summarize the 2012 film version of the book.
In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed and even the air is contaminated, a boy named Ted writes that he wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree in order to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey, including the story of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this doesn’t seem suspicious enough to you, it shows much resemblance to the short summary of the film The Lora in the Internet Film Archive in one aspect of the text that Cameron deals with, which begins as follows: “In Thneed-Ville, a city delighted with walls where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a child named Ted wants to win the heart of Audrey’s dream girl.”
Given the allegations that his work was a parent-in-law, it seems unlikely that Cameron is unable to ignore the main topic of the book, where he hears how an unnamed young boy was destroyed by the local community, despite the objections of the creature named Lorax, the butterfly, and "speaking on behalf of trees" who also named the book.
Most likely, such a weak Public Relations job was handed over to a command servant who, apparently, hadn’t read The Lorax to a child twenty times in a row.
A spokeswoman for the presidency said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but did not comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of getting out of England, but he was still disappointed
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenging task, but after seeing the British team selected for the tournament, I don’t think there’s a repeat of the last 3-0 test series defeats I’ve experienced.
Nevertheless, I do not exclude the possibility of a winning trip.
Alastair Cook’s team may be more inexperienced than it was three years ago, but they have well-to-do players on the strike line, and the collective understanding of the game is also strong; these don’t heal the wounds of 2012, they only provide a little youth-driven optimism.
In the bulk game, Moeen Ali evolves as a game router and represents an attack option even if the quality at the Trial level is unknown.

The decision to remove Adam Lyth was a difficult decision to analyze for me as the head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials opposed two good strikes in tough circumstances, and the simple but inevitable truth is that cricketers are judged by the outcome.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for instance, it was in the event of an announcement because – as I said before – the players were their best choices.
After a few fifty-number series, Lyth could see his career extending, but he determined his own fate.
If he works more for Yorkshire, I hope he will catch another chance.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player’s attitude, although he didn’t show his best performance, which didn’t surprise me; first of all, he’s a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long it will take for a test shooter to get a score.
Lyth – like his predecessor Sam Robson – got seven pieces, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton managed to win the match.
The only pain you may feel for Jonathan Trott may be that Britain goes to the Caribbean first - as Lyth's shape peaked - but this wasted opportunity is no longer a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and is a high-level shooter for me.
He’s an X-Factor cricketer, and we’ve seen this in Yorkshire when he scored 236 against us on Trent Bridge earlier this season.
At least he should be able to be taken for the same opportunity as before, but that of course depends on the formation of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen making the opening hit alongside Cook to get an extra game spin while holding four quicks worked, and I’m not against it.
I don’t understand why a shooter can’t shoot here, in addition, this left holder has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number 3 for them and it didn’t make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Trial in his first drop before starting out in 2001.
He picked up three hundred series immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a replacement game router and surprised me as an impressive young man in the limited conversations I had with him.
People can see the raw statistics—the 31 average on a hit and the 35 average on a ball—and think it’s a degradation, but there are not so many game spins that raise their hands and the player choices are made on the side of the younger one.
You will learn a lot on this tour.
Far from the team, England seems to have made a few clever add-ons to its own coach team.
The appointment of Sri Lanka shooter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the Test matches could be a clever measure.
He is one of the most adorable guys in the game; he will bring with him a lot of experience gained in all circumstances and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood tour comes for his white ball foot and adds a brutal series to both energy and gameplay.
I’ve always thought that he was born for the international cricket world, whether he was a player or a coach, and he has a sense of being guided like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room, even messages that have been said before, can bring a novelty to the team.
Colly’s teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting for a day games, Root is given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it.
While not everyone agrees, the plans are not made by those who choose the coaches and the players.
And don’t forget that, like the players, their work depends on the outcome.
Such decisions are never made easily.
If the economy is stagnant by 2017, Brexit could win the camp
David Cameron’s half-cooked re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is the case despite Jeremy’s “Yes or No?” Corbyn’s election to lead the Labour Party or the TUC’s outcry on Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a former European diplomat stated that some member states are tired of the UK’s agenda of dividing privileges and treaty changes that are just self-thinking that they don’t want most of them in the EU, which is entirely plunged into crises that they have not caused.
TUC had decided at its annual meeting in Brighton that it would not want them if they damaged social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George’s own day.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor say they attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals and draw their own pictures in front of the famous monuments there, and then return to their countries and gather allies for reform.
It is entirely related to me.
"Don't leave us alone with France," said my European friend, who wanted an outgoing Britain in the EU tent, saying that more and more short-minded ministers and officials in some capitals have come to a point where we no longer care that we stay in the shadow.
Germany’s cautious and prudent ally, Angela Merkel, has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the country before things get worse, as in the examples of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande is facing a re-election in France in 2017 or a change in power.
It is also a left-wing force.
Soon, a right-wing nationalist government will come to power in Poland and a left-wing government in Spain.
It is unlikely for Selfie Britons to use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom because they don’t want it because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of those ministers may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that will not benefit the situation during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign, in the style of the Scottish National Party; my friend says so.
“There would be no re-negotiation,” and “Britain won’t get anything to benefit from re-negotiating.”
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative Fleet Street is, and how anti-EU the oligarchic press barons are, since they were not so at the time of Tony Benn, they were the inspiration for the 1975 referendum, which endorsed our initiative with a ratio of 2 to 1.
In the early 1990s, the Brussels reporter, named as "the flat bananas of the EU", the chief Euro-oportunist Boris Johnson is remembered in this way.
Despite all his stupidities, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax scammers, foreigners listening to illegal phones, and alleged foreign residents who owned most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair often thought the same thing about them, and when a gorilla was torn in a cage, he understood that he had to distract his attention by giving him bananas at lunchtime and after him at tea time.
In fact, Miliband was Blair's opposition to Cameron's brilliant idea of a referendum, since Blair had adhered to the principle on the EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press did not forgive him.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who amicably shrugged my back at Westminster on Monday — I told him he had no time to lose me anymore — seems at risk of re-adopting Neil Kinnock’s boycott strategy of Murdoch in the 80s, which was then a mistake now.
While it will take time, he needs to develop a coherent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat on Sunday, not with me, but with the media.
I express Corbyn’s official position in Europe as being kindly improving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people out of the UKIP’s hostile tendency and the fierce supporters of the Conservative Little England say yes.
Indeed, that’s what Hilary Benn said on radio and television this week, “I’m a Benn but not a Bennite,” because she naively forced herself not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of John McDonnell as a shadow lord was a bad idea.
This reminded me of his father’s struggle on television in the 1970s to his friends in the labor cabinet over disloyalty, his lack of progress and his loss of office.
Hilary’s fight was more attractive.
But “Benn’s statement – struggling to stay “in all circumstances” – was not the same as what McDonnell said or what JC said to their lawmakers at a special meeting on Monday night.
Given that it touches me, Corbyn continues to preserve the importance of messaging discipline from the details he tries to convey, regardless of the yearly image, in the 7/24 television era and in particular in the social media entrance, which is the bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it is quite reasonable to challenge Europe, allowing Cameron to guarantee Labour’s support in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s transitions toward EU membership in line with Bennite’s siege economy and anti-capitalist backgrounds are no longer just a particular debate among left-wing opponents, where small-difference narcissism is the cornerstone of educational liberalism.
As with his transition on NATO—Tom Watson is determined that JC won’t campaign to leave—foreign diplomats will have to try to get out of them for their masters in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital in privileges to Britain, where they could all be wasted, while they also have suspicious voters?
As I was told at the opening of the UK Influence Security Forum on Monday, the US is already quite disappointed by the British’s weak minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-cutting Conservative Party government in power.
Experts criticize UK public health e-cigarette research
At a 12-person meeting held by a government-funded agency with people associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers stated that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence the British Public Health (PHE) used in its report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE released its report last month as a “turning point” it described as “a detailed examination of the evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month’s headline of the Lancet medical journal targeted the “extremely rotten foundation” based on the main finding of PHE.
Two other researchers, who wrote in the BMJ, questioned whether the claims were “built on sand or rock.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than smoking according to current best estimates" to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this results from a meeting of 12 people gathered together to develop a multi-critical decision analysis (MCDA) model to form a synthesis of their views on the harm of various nicotine-containing products; the findings of the meeting are summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previouslyly received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also said in a sustainability report that BAT has also approved the public health promotion document.
They added that one in 12 people at the meeting receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but that it was not previously to have received funding from the Philip Morris International tobacco company.
No information was given about how panel members were selected, but some of them included some of the known giants of e-cigarettes where the industry funding was in the article.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are unknown for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco officer at PHE also attended.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the research paper the group wrote “effectively acknowledged that there was a lack of tangible evidence about the harmfulness of most products according to many criteria.”
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said claims that "e-cigarettes have no evidence of being a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers" were too early.
Prof Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said claims at BMJ had been responded in advance.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have been smokers throughout their lifetime die from this addiction.
All evidence indicates that e-cigarettes are small compared to the health risks they pose, but we should continue to examine their long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear task: to inform the public about what evidence shows and does not show, especially in a time when compared to tobacco, where there is much confusion about its harm.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
We are fulfilling our national responsibility by clearly disclosing the existing evidence – that e-cigarettes are not risk-free but carry only a small fraction of the harm smoking causes.
Previous articleChannel 4 CEO Says BBC Should Leave EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and said advertising rivals could “give their right arms” to hit shows like the Albert Square series.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs, which are likely to be watched by a smaller group of viewers, on channels such as BBC4, against the most-rated programs of its competitors at valuable intervals.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the agency wanted more collaboration with other organizations; Johnson said it had been unsuccessfully attempted for six years at his time on Channel 4 to establish a connection with the BBC.
Johnson told the House of Lords’ Communications Committee during a questioning about the future of the BBC, “I struggle with the idea that the BBC would explicitly order and broadcast programs that could be shown by unsubsidized competitors.”
If you’re continuing to apply a license fee that I’m not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, the output should be reduced to at least programs that others don’t do or order.
The Voice is broadcasting in the primetime range because they want to provide as broad support as possible in the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish, which is ridiculous and clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without aid should be funded by a reduced tax rate.
One is The Voice and the other is EastEnders, and it’s actually done within the company.
To be honest, other channels give their right arms for it.
I try to see how public services are.
I don’t think this will disrupt the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing the rating "for the glory of the people who work here and because these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
BBC’s comments on the most popular programs repeat the comments of former Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart course in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer BBC to sell programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said BBC’s more suitable public service programs went to BBC4 and that there would be no viewing measurement here but that they would be eligible for tax forgiveness and that they could argue to continue their demonstrative religious tasks on providing a £4 billion ground in graduate income, adding, “We’re also, of course, doing all these deletion programs that no one has watched.”
They put them in empty places that no one would ever see.
Regarding the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: “I invite you to find a more regressive system for those who benefit most from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is a huge value, but I wonder if it’s why people who have £150 are so big money don’t watch so much of the BBC.
David Elstein, a former Sky and Channel 5 administrator who also presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that part of the BBC’s output is now officially classified as education—that’s 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio output—and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be ahead of it, and that it should be replaced by “information, enlightenment, and education.”
Regarding partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about only a handful of Proms shown on TV and work with advertisers to ensure that all of them are watched online.
‘Sonogenetics’ allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
In the video, you can see how they changed direction when they were shot by the sound vibrations of the wire wolves.
Scientists have grown wolves with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave explosions.
Little wire wolves change direction as soon as they are hit by vibrations of sound that people can’t hear.
The vibrations are powered by activating genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry the membrane channels that respond to the infrasound waves.
Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
Researchers said wolves have proven the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, so ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an intrusive procedure that gives people electrical vibrations into their brains to treat Parkinson’s symptoms.
Wolves most often do not react beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they react when surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he finds amplify the supersonic waves and thus allow the wolves to pass through.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures located in the membranes of some wolf cells called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves enable these ion channels to open up and activate the cells to which they are connected.
To create hypersonic-controlled thread wolves, Chalasani genetically modified wolves to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applied supersonicity to the altered creatures, the sound waves were powered by micro-bubbles, and motor neurons were transmitted into the wolves, which were also modified here.
This procedure has similarities with optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to run and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that should be sent through an optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency supersonic waves can unhinderedly pass through the tissue and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said, “By using gene therapy and a healing virus, we believe that human neurons targeted in clinical settings for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to ultrasound signals.”
He also added that other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment – on your doorstep!
Advertisements Destroy Britain's Weapons Trade
Watch the video of the International Weapons Exhibition.
This is a terrible drone killer!
Those who break their feet!
pieces of bombs.
And electric shock cops that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
Thin sound and cartoon images produced for the International Amnesty, prepared to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Center in London, leave no doubt that the world’s largest weapons exhibition is a sharp scam.

But a different campaign continues with posters on bus stops and metro trains and requires a double look.
In one, he translates the DLR line into a tank using the London Metro fonts and brand, saying, “The important announcement is, will you travel in the DLR between 15-18 September?”
This September, a bunch of gun dealers will attack DLR... customers are asked to help stop this gun show.
300 posters of artists exhibiting works at Bansky's Museum of Innocence in Dismaland.
A collective called the Private Guard Group helped to distribute it using “Advertising Space Shock Packs,” which amounted to £6 and claimed that “bus stop advertising spaces on the planet gained access to about one-third of them.”
Transport to London was not pleased with the "vandalism" of this poster.
One of the advertisements was created by the Private Brigade Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questionable every day and looking for ways to bring political affairs to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are acting alongside activists in protest movements and are beginning to realize that their art needs to come out in the real world in order to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms trade poster is also facing those travelling in the subway.
The video was watched by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the free-to-use advertising agency VCCP, which was created by both the graphic designer and the audio artist for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence against gun fairs ads — with empty space in the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s present them with a campaign they’re trying to escape.”
They played with the idea of making a more realistic, clever corporate advertisement, but “decorated with bright colors and animation, it became more striking.”
Tom Davies of the Amnesty International said: “They helped us a lot in creating concerns about the sale of illicit torture equipment in Fattah.”
What we need now is that the British government take action to prevent torture equipment from being sold illegally in front of our doors.
Per the most creative art on the gun exhibition comes from the interior ExCeL, where exhibitors sell products with fantastic cover.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the U.S. Army for "AT4CS RS launched from the shoulder."
It contains “an unparalleled-shaped warhead that strikes a big blow through the armor to the target.”
Whatever you do, it won’t be pleasant.
The eight golden rules of living in student homes
It’s been 11 years of being transferred to student homes as an uninteresting 19-year-old, and I still believe in bars and moral relativity, but now I remember the gritty smiles I’ve disturbed – and my countless long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be digested into eight golden rules.
Moving in the home can look from nervousness to complete horror.
The seduction of seduction: where it is to people, where it hasn’t lost years, where it insists on Corbyn, and why you “obviously neither love nor hate Marmite because really gentlemen it’s just an extract of mice HAHAHAH I’ll be in the room.”
Take a breath.
And let others get one too – ask questions and show relevance.
This will direct the conversation, and it will help you to distinguish what you like from the people you don’t talk to, even if your warts are stuck and they’re striking the fire extinguisher.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night spaces and crowd places, but they’re also places where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting a relationship at college
They are treated badly at the university.
Your room may be an intimate place, but many dormitory corridors develop a culture of inter-room settlement and this is open to friendly, social and lifelong friendship.
This could be hell for someone who is trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little so that I can replace the energy I spend on communicating with you.”
Try to feel like a friend is tired of socializing and throw a message instead of maybe knocking at the door.
When you knock on the door, do it.
A friend in the student home had adopted a policy of being invited inside if the door was not locked.
He saw a lot.
Don’t make friends by cooking.
Since you started college at the heights of the food competition madness, it would be less strange to introduce yourself by stealing people’s doors with a plate of brownie and less than the 1950s “Welcome to our neighborhood, I have cooked something for you, now I smile while asking you personal questions.”
Offering people home-made bonuses is a great way to make friends.
Home friends will feel compelled to talk, and maybe they will associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Obviously, it’s about you being a master cook.
A well-mixed bulk of pasta, sugar and oil will cause people to imitate sleeping when you knock on the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously to scratch someone’s chicken is theft but to steal a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the owner twice.
Even if he is most likely swimming in it, he will tell you to take care of himself.
It’s very annoying for someone to steal their stuff and I understand you – but try to deal with it more maturedly than my fellow citizen.
He is now in prison.
Do not make noise to prevent people from sleeping or studying.
This doesn’t just mean you’re a decent person, but because you’re the singles in glass houses.
A girl in my corridor pressed her neighbor on the other side and told her that it was 3 p.m. because the clock was 3 p.m. and she was in the morning exam.
Their answers opened up even more.
Finally, when they turned off at 5 a.m., the girl gently let them sleep for two hours before going to her three-hour exam, turning on her last sound and locking the door.
Wouldn’t it be too romantic to move your future wife to the same corridor with you?
On the contrary, isn’t it so strange that you misunderstand a corridor friend and think that you’re your future spouse, get stuck, get away and have to see him every day and watch your common friends be taken prisoner?
Of course, this is heartfelt, but if your fiery corridor neighbor is definitely not your future partner, at least talk to the child and advise common sense.
When you notice in a joyful memory that someone has left their keys inside without locking the door, know that the line between joking and insulting someone is thinner than the box.
A good joke is fun, but it will take time to get back.
You can give someone a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding their things – but never contaminate someone’s room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in a glass of water in the freezer, but don’t stick your stuff to the ceiling more than twice.

Her heart stopped when she became beautiful.
Raquel Santos (28), a mother of two children living in Rio de Janeiro, went to her aesthetic doctor last Monday to clear the traces of laughter on the edges of her mouth.
The woman who was injected the filling material into her face accelerated her heartbeat and breathing after a while.
His heart stopped after he lost his life.
Police are investigating whether the woman’s daily use of a drug called “Potenay” played a role in her death.
The real cause of death will be determined after the autopsy.
Debora Azevedo, one of the model’s closest friends, said in a statement to the Brazilian press that she was obsessed with the aesthetic surgery of Santos, his two sons, who were 7 and 13 years old.
Santos was the second to participate in the most important beauty competitions in Brazil in December.
Oil companies officially collapsed
Since the fall of oil prices in 2014, investments of about $400 billion have been postponed until the end of last year, while deep-sea oil search projects have been suspended.
According to research by consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have caused the suspension of a $380 billion project in oil and gas exploration/production, while millions of barrels of oil production have been delayed from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa across a wide range of geographies.
The biggest reason for the cost cuts was at $115 in the summer of 2014, while oil prices fell to the lowest level in 12 years, losing 70 percent in value in 1.5 years, the report says the company’s budgets have narrowed dramatically.
$400 billion in assets
While crude oil prices make new surprises every day, they last dropped below $30 to the lowest level in the last 12 years.
“Is oil falling $15?” and “Is oil now cheaper than water?” discussions are rising today, research by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie reveals how the industry has been affected by falling prices.
Wood Mackenzie, who revealed in a report released in July that falling oil prices caused the suspension of $200 billion in 46 major energy investments, revealed in his new study where this figure had reached by the end of 2015.
Accordingly, 22 major projects have been postponed in the last six months of 2015, while a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since the oil crash began in 2014.
The value of these projects is approximately $400 billion.
2.9 million barrels per day
The study, which emphasized that the impact of low oil prices on company plans was "brutal", noted that the most affected projects were deep-sea development projects.
The suspended projects amounted to a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reserves, thus delaying 2.9 million barrels of daily oil production until 2025.
According to the study, while the final investment decision for most of the projects in question was postponed to 2017 and beyond, the initial production targets also recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 delayed projects, the report highlighted $170 billion of potential investment expected to be made over the next five years, "most of which is $170 billion in deep-sea projects."
This is because the cost of the initial investment is very high.
“70 percent of the country’s maritime spending is mainly made up of oil-intensive projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. in the Gulf of Mexico.”
According to the study, the countries with the most delayed oil project inventories are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries hold almost 90 percent of their delayed liquid (oil) reserves.
The countries with the largest amounts of delayed gas reserves, Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia together account for 85 percent.
While much of the natural gas waiting to be released here is located in the deep seas, it requires complex and costly development solutions such as building a zero-level liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant.
While the most exposed companies are oil giants with successive commitments in the deep seas, Canadian oil slopes and the Hazar Region, the companies are also said to be trying to adapt to the "longer and lower" oil price scenario.
Eyes in Iran
Not so much as four years ago there was a picture: the US and Europe had imposed an embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran’s nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110, and it was debated how to limit Iranian oil exports without causing a sudden leap in prices.
When we go back this week, we see a different scenario.
Oil prices hit $30 for the first time since 2004, mainly due to the explosion in U.S. production and rising embargoes on Iran.
My eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow to the oil market, which has already been said to be quite saturated.
This can also cause prices to fall below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to seize market share of Iran, will pump more oil and a price war between Iran and Saudi Arabia could arise.
As the sanctions go up, Iran’s main target is the fast-growing oil market of Asia, its former partners in India and Europe.
Iranian officials have said in previous statements that they aim to increase exports by 500,000 barrels a day at first, and later to market more.
According to Reuters’ map information, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) are waiting in the outskirts of Iran, with at least 13 of them fully or massively filled.
Iran is the country with the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to regulatory exemptions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports reached 3 million barrels a day.
Supported Asset Value Research Expert Aysun Heights answered the question of whether oil will fall below $20: “China-based global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices, while deepening the loss in oil prices.”
In China, the world’s largest oil importer, we see oil losses reaching 20 percent since the New Year’s Eve, with fears that oil demand will decline in parallel to the economic slowdown.
In addition, as the dollar gains value globally and the problem of global supply surplus, we can witness oil prices below $30 in the coming days.
Unless we see lasting prices above $32-33 levels, the upward movement in oil may remain limited and the downward pressure may rise.
At this point, closures below the critical $30 level can be said to play a key role in keeping the falls going on.
In this case, it should not be surprising to see reliefs lasting up to the support zone at 23.30-25.60.

I was born in Paris, lived in London, then moved to New York.
I also took important positions.
During this time, I started advising Koton for the last two years.
Then I saw the potential in this geography and the brand of Koton.
I realized that there was everything needed to become a store chain in the world era.
I am here to accomplish it now.
Will you succeed soon?
of course .
Although it is already a young brand, it is now sold in 50 countries.
We produce 50 collections a year, with 15 separate sections.
There is everything a store chain needs to have.
We can meet the needs of consumers from different geographies from Dubai to Moscow.
We are now opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era.
Should you open a store in Paris?
and yes.
It’s not because Europe’s economy is good.
But you open some shops for the image.
If you shop in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you make money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, and both are necessary for a brand that plays globally.
Let’s talk about trends.
We have a very romantic season ahead.
Flying shiffon dresses, soft tones, pink, white, red.
Designs...
We are going through very difficult and cruel times, and in these difficult times, the fashion world is always trying to bring a glimpse of happiness to life by bringing stylish interior designs to the podium.
This is what we do too.
So, in the new season, the "era of grace" is back.
Let’s go back to your years at Victoria’s Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I’m not just talking about her magnificent physique: she’s such a positive, so good girl!
While I was working, he sat next to me, saying, “Love, are you hungry?”
It was so sweet.
You know why I’ve talked about it, I’ve researched and you’ve interviewed all Victoria’s Secret models.
How beautiful was Caroline?
Adriana Lima has impressed me with her beauty.
And yes, that sound!
That speech, that speech...
After a while, you’re going to say, “Sit down and look good, do nothing else!”
It brings nerve.
Yes, there are such shocks.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in my life, but I was terrified by her vanity.
Most of them now.
The new angels are not the same as before.
I remember Gisele’s time.
It was very difficult to work with him.
He came to the scene and smoked like a cigarette.
It’s not Tyrannosaurus.
No one can drink, only he can drink.
Pay for the Diva.
Two months ago, Victoria’s Secret show had the lowest rating in its history.
Why do you think?
As I said, the time of the beautiful angels is over.
Who is Gigi Hadid?
What is beautiful?
Kendall Jenner is like a tree.
There is no curve, nothing.
Kate Moss’s curves are zero, but it’s the biggest name in the fashion industry.
How beautiful his face was.
I want to exercise my right of objection.
I interviewed him last year, and his face was a lot broken.
So much to smoke and drink, now it’s ugly.
He had such a beautiful face.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
It was the end of the supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington.
Christy was my neighbor and I saw her every morning without makeup.
Such a state of beauty, such a grace cannot be.
How about Cara Delevingne?
He is losing himself.
Not in every campaign.
People are tired.
There is no hunger for celebrity models like before.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
We will go on that too.
Because this is the trend.
25 Turkish Writers
The authors, among whom were the presidents of the International Union of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, said threats and physical assaults targeting their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a regular part of life.
In the letter, the two attacks targeting the Hürriyet newspaper in Turkey, the Koza group's oppression and the arrest of Vice News journalists, investigations and arrests of journalists were among the worrisome developments.
My mother had a half-working job.
Turkey-Business "We believe that mothers are given half-working rights to re-establish rental labor."
“This could be a trojan horse,” TISK said, “and we are concerned that this arrangement in favor of women will prevent women from working.”
The new rights that were planned to be introduced to civil servants and female workers after birth or adoption passed through the committee with discussions that lasted all day.
6 months of part-time work or free leave after birth, the most frequent topic of the commission discussions of regulations that bring the possibility of part-time work until the child reaches primary school age was "rental labor".
CHP Izmir MP Musa Çam, who stated that it is correct to carry out partial work until the child goes to primary school, but stated that they have some concerns, said: "If you bring the rental work arrangement behind this, we will be in front of it until the end."
Enis Bağdadioğlu, who participated in the Commission talks on behalf of Turkish-Business, also said that they experienced similar concerns, "We have doubts about how the place of the female worker in half-time work will be filled."
Bagdadioğlu said that if the rental workforce comes back on this occasion, there will be new problems that will exceed the workforce, "We will therefore monitor the developments related to the special employment offices with concern."
TIC Secretary-General Bülent Pirler stated that part-time work was introduced by law for 5 years, while "there is no such long-term part-time work in other countries."
Look at the event.
“Where there are 1 or 2 employees, you need to think about the outcomes of this practice.”
TOBB client Ahmet Şağar also said that it will be difficult to find a worker if the practice goes on to life.
Saying that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, Şağar said that "the arrangement concerning the special employment offices should be reached, a compromise should be reached between workers and employers."
Feyzioloğlu: We do not support
Feyzioğlu’s statement reads: “We do not agree with this announcement, we are not able to join and support it.”
There is no criticism of the PKK.
You couldn’t say a single negative word to the PKK, the divisive terrorist organization, you didn’t dust it.
We do not take seriously the heavy statements addressed only to the state, we do not take them seriously, and we do not find them intimate.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If the representatives of the state, public officials, security forces have any unlawful behavior within this framework, we will follow it.
When we say, “Don’t destroy the state” to the remnants of the Romantic period, who look with sympathy to the divisors or the divisors, they attack us as “Divisors, fascists.”
When we say, “This state must act in accordance with the law, it must always keep the law above it,” they say, “You are dividing.”
We are the bridge.
We are always responsible for telling the truth.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgian, was born in Mersin on July 16, 1960.
After the divorce of her parents, she moved to Ankara with her mother Sebahat Çakır in 1966.
After the Yenimahalle Yunus Order Primary School, he entered the piano section of the Ankara State Conservatory, but he left for a while due to financial difficulties and worked at PTT, enchanting his age.
After appearing at the Feyman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends in 1979, he accepted his offer to work.
Feyman's Night Club, together with the Group Lokomotif Orchestra, performed with the repertoire of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the fashion of the era.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longplay from Atlas Plak.
Bergen, who could not withstand her husband’s violence while continuing her career in art, fled her wife many times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was shot in the face by her husband.
Bergen, who lost one eye in this attack and burned most of his body, was persuaded and staged by Cengiz Özşeker, the composer of the song "Kimbilir?" that celebrated Kibariye after treatment.
The artist who staged in Izmir Pırlanta Pavilion, which was owned by Özşeker until 1985, together with his boss prepared a demo cassette called "Brotherless Destiny" and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist who made his first professional longplay in the music market in Istanbul, "Man Loves" in the music direction of Burhan Bayar, became famous with his "Woman of Sickness" towards the end of 1986.
The album was awarded in April 1987 by the record company with the title of "1986 Album Most Selling Arabesk Female Artist" with the Gold Record and Gold Cassette.
In the same year with the script and directing of Ülkü Erakalın in the film "The Woman of Pain" Yalçın Gülhan went in front of the camera with Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron.
Bergen, who gained a large crowd of fans, escaped at the last moment from a knife attack at Adana, where he was going for a concert.
The artist, who also left the stage for a period, in the directions of the great masters Selami Shahin, Özer Shenay and Cengiz Tekin, respectively released his albums "He is also Yak God", "The Price of Love" and "I Don't Want".
Bergen, who officially divorced from her husband in April 1989, returned to the stage in June 1989 with his last album, Years Never Forgive.
The artist, who began the promotional tours of the album, which was met with intense interest, was shot dead by his wife in Adana Pozanti on the night of August 14, 1989, which connected it to August 15, 1989.
His homeland was destroyed by Mersin.
In 29 years of his life, Bergen made five longplay films and a video film with 129 songs on 11 cassettes.
The allegations of the artist’s legendary way of signing his car with a different and powerful voice gained accuracy with the first day of the album “I’m Young” released after his death.

He celebrated his 114th birthday.
Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the poet of the country, was commemorated with the "Good Birth of Nazim" event in the 114th year of his birth.
The event was held in the hall where the name of the poet was given in the Beautiful Cultural Center of Konak Municipality.
Activities with poetry and music auditions were performed by the famous poet's poems, theatre and film actor Rüşt Asian.
In addition, the three Asian Anatolian Music Communities accompanied the event with their comments.
He has accompanied many artistic acts.
Among these names were Ali Seçkiner Buyer, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Star, Zeynep Göknur Star and Ziya Özsökmen.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazim Wismet Culture and Art Foundation.

He was arrested several times for his political thoughts and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into many languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality made special works on the 114th birthday of the world famous poet Nazim Hikmet.
The municipality that worked on the documentary "Bursa's Nazımı", which tells about Nazim's 11 years in Bursa Prison, also issued a personal penalty for the poet for the first time in Turkish history.
Thus, with the cooperation of PTT, the first personal pullo in the history of Turkey was issued on behalf of Nazim Hikmet.
This special pulp and first-day envelopes, priced at 1.40 TL, will be presented to guests on the night held in Nazim Hikmet Kulturevi on Thursday, January 14.
They will be deported by bicycle
However, as no agreement can be reached between the two countries, most Syrian refugees will have to return to Russia, turning the pedal at less than 20 degrees this time.
Because it was safer and cheaper in the summer, a group of refugees flew to Russia by plane and passed from Murmansk to Norway.
As the agreement between the two countries did not allow migrants to cross the border, they crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to return these refugees.
Norwegian authorities have ordered repairs for abandoned bicycles when crossing the border.
3 billion euros to Turkey in EU crisis
Turkey has pledged 3 billion euros for refugees.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has criticized Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking the fund to be transferred to Turkey.
Noting that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker pointed out that the EU has to find 3 billion euros.
“This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey.”
We haven’t reached the 3 billion yet.
“It’s a matter of EU credibility, so it’s important.”
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26, the previously set date.
Italy is among the countries with a positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources believe that Rome’s position on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to the problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some of the union countries.
There have been tensions between Italy and the EU for a long time.
Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU at the recent EU summit on energy, banking and migrants and subsequently.
Juncker, who criticized Renzi's attitude at yesterday's press conference, said "Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
“It is wrong for Renzi, who I love so much, to humiliate the EU Commission at every opportunity.”
Juncker has suggested that Renzi is playing for the domestic public.
One billion of the €3 billion promised to Turkey will come from the EU budget.
Two billion euros will come from the national budgets.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
The Rum Administration, which said it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, has decided to transfer its €2.3 million share to the EU budget for use in support of Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is expected to be used in the 2016-2017 period.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon.
Father Abdullah Kurdi, speaking to the official Russian news agency Sputnik, reacted harshly and "I cried for this cartoon if you want it right."
He said, “I felt very bad.”
Father Kurdi, who said he expected positive things from the French hijacker magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, said:
It was a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very sad about this cartoon.
Aylan was a 2-year-old boy and died.
Aylan, me and my family should have been respected by Charlie Hebdo, but the opposite happened.
This magazine should respect the children who die.
They published disrespectful caricatures about our master.
They made publications about God.
It is a small thing done to my child in the presence of God and the Prophet.
The Kurdish leader, who lives in Erbil, called on the whole world and the humor magazine to respect all children who die.
They should not suffer their families.
Aylan Kurdi’s Canadian coat Tima Kurdi was one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, a 3-year-old Syrian Kurd, who shot his body on the coast of Bodrum in the signed cartoon, believes that when he grows up, he could be 'one of the harassers in Germany'.
Last year, because of the publication of Muhammad cartoons, the French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by radical religious groups in which 12 people were killed, once again became the focus of debate because of the cartoon on Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicted pig-faced harassers chasing women and invoking immigrants, as in the early German city of Cologne, as in the harassment of women during the Christmas celebrations.
The cartoon that caused different reactions on social media is actually part of a 4 square column.
On the column it reads, “It’s not France,” and according to many readings it is criticized by the growing hostility to refugees, along with other values that belong to France.
On the other hand, the cartoon has led to many people accusing Charlie Hebdo of racism.
The Charlie Hebdo magazine in a number last year that Germany agreed to accept 800,000 refugees, but criticized France’s reluctance to open its doors to immigrants.
The cartoon reads, “He was very close to his goal,” while the advertisement reads, “Two children’s menus for one price.”
The autopsy of the Germans who died in Sultanahmet in Germany
According to the weekly Der Spiegel magazine’s website, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office of Germany has decided to bring the body of 10 people who lost their lives in the attack to Germany.
The funeral of the dead will be celebrated today or tomorrow at the airport with a German Air Force aircraft.
In Germany, experts from the Identity Identification Commission, affiliated with the Federal Criminal Office (BKA), which performs forensic procedures, go to countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who normally died in accidents or attacks, carry out their identification and autopsy there.
According to Der Spiegel, this time the situation will be different.
According to the journal, officials from the Federal Criminal Office appealed to Turkish authorities for the identification and autopsy of the dead in Istanbul, but Turkish officials did not accept the proposal.
The Federal Criminal Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated in hospitals.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has died.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was especially mindful of his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood was born in New York in 1942 and published in Turkish as follows: Escape from the Class -- The Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- The Origin of Capitalism -- The Empire of Capital -- Return to Marx.
Refugees banned from swimming pools
According to the news in the German press, the municipality will lift the ban if social workers in the country report that the message of the ban is understood by refugees.
In a statement to the WDR, Markus Schnapka, a social department officer who noted that the municipality does not want to punish the innocent for the behavior of several people, said the rest of the homes were informed in three languages about the values respected in Germany.
Schnapka noted that Germany does not dispute the value of gender equality, adding that the municipality will punish all forms of assault and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival passage in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of harassment scandals in Cologne at the upcoming carnival passes.
The municipality announced that the carnival passage was cancelled because there was no guarantee that harassment events would not occur.
What are the benefits of cooking in steam?
Steam cooking technology, a technique that does not kill the vitamins and minerals in nutrients, is becoming increasingly popular.
Steam cooking, one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East for centuries, boosts metabolism and facilitates digestion.
With this method that completely eliminates problems such as unpreparation, the bacteria and microbes in the nutrients are also completely killed.
The proteins in the diet, such as cellulose and nickel, are completely digested with this technique, which makes the food softer.
Steam cooking at low pressure is carried out in a pot with the help of steam tanks or steam machines.
When cooking at high pressure, the amount of water used and the cooking time is small.
The best example of this can be shown in the cooking pot.
In order to cook foods such as vegetables, especially in diet menus, you must first wash the vegetables thoroughly and then put them in the stove and wait for them to soften thoroughly.
A deep pot is filled with water in a third proportion and the steam is placed inside the winding pot.
The mouth is left half-closed.
This allows the steam to come out comfortably.
The January fever is first boosted to the highest level to ensure the boiling of the water, then the January fever is boosted to a lower level to a constant temperature.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked in steam for about 10 to 15 minutes are checked with the help of a barrel after thoroughly cooking.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the stove and served on plates.
In the steam cooking technique, the appearance, color and smell of the food does not change, so this method is healthy.
The taste of the food remains the same.
The quality and taste of the food is not damaged.
In steam cooking, which is also one of the most economical methods of cooking, the nutrient loss is also kept at a minimum.
Vegetables cooked in steam also offer a satisfying feast to those who eat with their more vivid and vivid appearances.
This method is often preferred, especially because it is often used in dietary meals.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "last" album of the aliens
Knowing you’re going to die, making that last album without telling anyone, making the death bed an artistic expression in the clip you’re drawing...
Things like this; we may seem too "in the air" for worldly fans.
I say earthly fans because I am among those who sincerely believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He had come to our Earth from another corner of the universe; now he has returned to his homeland; this is what is happening.
It came because there was an inspiration to be given to all the world’s artists, not just Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He honored his duty.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes Price: $9.99 5/5
He was probably fed by Warhol, Kubrick, who was from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, “This is something I’m an alien,” and interfered with us by saying “Space Oddity.”
He didn’t really get involved; he was always a few steps ahead.
Many people found the way they lost because of him.
The musician and listener.
If we put aside his interest in plastic arts and acting, it would be unfair to say “It was only music” for his music.
The characters that flow from song to song and personally create them; their sendings, innovation, discography and discography represent an artistic integrity for me.
I can’t call him the grandfather of glam rock or the cousin of punk.
If I do, what will happen to that avant-garde electronic movement, which has been hidden in love since childhood?
David Bowie reminded us of the meaning of the word “icon” until the years we’ve had it in our mouths.
He was not a man, he was not a woman, he was not a man.
It was a body.
It appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
He left the world two days after the release of his 26th studio album, Blackstar.
He tried to practice the "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" we listened to before the album was released.
We thought, “He is old, he talks about death,” and he knew everything.
Another last game...
It was released much earlier than the stunning "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" behind the message and emotional load of the album, but we can say that the number of songs we know with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" recorded by re-editing for this album was four when the album was released.
"Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are also very good songs.
As a whole, it is based on a very powerful musical structure, but made with such a sincere, instantaneous feeling as "Blackstar".
No death or a “calculation with the past” album.
It’s just a “last” album.
“The End” of a musical life masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey attacked in Sultanahmet attack
Holger Münch, the head of the Federal Security Service of Germany, spoke on Tuesday about the attack on Sultanahmet Square, in which 10 German citizens were killed.
Münch said the target of the attack was not German citizens, but Turkey.
“400 people in charge”
But Münch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously."
Münch noted that there was a decrease in the number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join ISIS, while a large number of people returned from war zones.
Münch said: “There are almost 400 dangerous people that we should not keep in watch at the moment.”
Munch called for better coordination and closer communication between police agencies in Europe.
Turkish officials said the live bomber who organized the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the attacker's identity has not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with a series of concerts, enchanted fans with his "Sezen's Years" concert in the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first episode of the concert series, which took place in July, also took place in the Volkswagen Arena on January 15-16.
At the concert, Aksu took all his audiences on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to love songs that touch our personal lives, Aksu sang songs on social topics that are of close concern to our country and our world.
Aksu, who said he would say goodbye to the life of the stage after the planned concerts, saddened his fans.
At the "Szenli Years" concert, Sezen Aksu came out with a separate story in each piece in front of fans who filled the Volkswagen Arena.
Each story, show, light and stage show took viewers to different times.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, a video show featuring Istanbul paintings of Revolution Erbil was also held.
Aksu also invited them to the stage for the first time by featuring videos previously recorded by his fans.
25 cents for bread in Ankara and Istanbul
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread began to be sold from 1 TL at a price of 25 cents.
Prior to the New Year, especially in December, on rumors in the direction of "the future of the increase in bread" Minister of Food, Agriculture and Animals Faruk Steel and Customs and Trade Minister Bülent Tüfenkci had made statements in the form of "No Time".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold yesterday from 1 TL.
Halil Ibrahim Balcı, President of the Federation of Turkish Breeders on the 25 cents increase to the bread, said: "Time has not been made, the tariff decision from 2 years ago has begun to be applied," and added:
“This was a decision made two years ago.
The Chamber of Commerce established this tariff two years ago.
Pricing in Turkey.
So a new increase was made and the price did not rise.
But because of the competition in Ankara in some regions was selling trade for 75 pennies.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
They did not lower the trade price of their bread, which trusted them, because of the competition they had to apply 1 TL.
There is no increase or increase.
The unused price applies.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of the kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL, and if we do not experience a very big trouble, we will complete the year with this price."
In some regions of Istanbul, bread has been sold for 1.25 TL.
This time it was Burkina Faso.
In an attack on a luxury hotel in Burkina Faso, a western African country, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed.
The attack was taken over by the North African arm of al-Qaeda.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after a terrorist attack by ISIS in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, the world’s most populous Muslim country with 250 million inhabitants.
In a day-to-day bombing and armed attack on a Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops, a Canadian and an Indonesian were killed.
Indonesian officials say the attackers were inspired by the November 13 Paris massacre.
BBC security reporter Frank Garner also noted that the move is part of a frightening trend that has emerged recently in many cities around the world.
The United States has also been hit by terrorist attacks recently.
In early December, 14 people were killed in a gun attack by a couple in San Bernardino, California.
U.S. attacks on San Bernardino
After the live bombing in Sultanahmet, in which 10 German tourists were killed, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also recalled that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, "We experienced two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then terror will win.
We used the phrase “without going back.”
ISIS has stopped WhatsApp and is talking with Alrawi
According to a new report, the terrorist organization ISIL is using its own chat tool to communicate independently from chat apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to a report from Defense One, the organization is taking advantage of a new messaging app to communicate with one another.
This Android app called “Alrawi” is distributed and installed via an APK file.
The application allows the organization to encrypt messages and share media among themselves.
Flashing in Iraq
The functionality of the app remains “primitive” over popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to the Ghost Security Group.
How powerful the encryption used is is not yet known.
ISIS had previously carried out all their communications via the Telegram app, which allows them to send messages via an encrypted connection.
But Telegram revealed the channels ISIS members spoke about.
Moreover, the U.S. government is demanding that app developers place backdoors to their applications.

How should a semester vacation be assessed?
How should students evaluate the semester vacation? we asked the question to the educational expert-student coach Murat Aydın.
Half-year holidays should not only be considered as rest, entertainment, spending time in front of television and computer.
Half-year vacation is a great opportunity to prepare for the new training period and review the past period.
The semester holiday, called free time, is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a half-assessment list.
Write down everything you have planned and try to implement.
You will be sure to enjoy it and have a very enjoyable season.
Now let’s talk about how to have an effective semester period for students who are first preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the most frequently asked questions from friends who are preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we assess this period, should we solve a lot of questions, or should we solve them if we have missing issues?"
In order to respond to these questions and to have an effective period, let us first enter our writing with advice to friends who are preparing for the exam.
While the exam preparation process should be a process starting from 9th grade under normal conditions, we are trying to complete it more in the last 1 year, which for us makes it more efficient, efficient and accurate to spend the last year.
The final class student must also carry out the written work of the school together with the preparation for the exam.
Even if the graduate student who has completed the school has entered and experienced the exam (YGS-LYS) at least once, the year in which he will be prepared for the exam again as a graduate student is critical for him.
Because most graduate students and their families see the 'O' year as their last chance, which creates greater stress.
Studying is the work the student does not enjoy, only because he feels obliged, and thus often always leaves the most, but for the students who do this; for the students who do it regularly, for the students who make it a habit, this has become entirely a task, and what to do is always within a plan.
Now we have a half-year vacation ahead of us and we should evaluate it best.
We need to have a plan to manage our time well.
Study in a semester:
Everyone should first make a plan for their own situation.
The first period must plan what has been solved, what is missing; the day, week and 15 days time.
During this period, there must be repetitions of issues and questions to be solved.
At the same time, students who do not have a lot of lessons can solve an average of 1-2 trials.
Research shows that people forget 75 percent of what they learned in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetfulness is to repeat.
Students, especially those who make too many mistakes in previous subjects, should emphasize their general repetition.
Identify your missing topics first and plan for the day, place them every day, and be sure to deal with them.
This planning will relax you both academically and psychologically.
When putting things in your plan, be careful that you make the most mistakes.
You won’t have such a long vacation.
Solve the questions:
Answering questions is as important as repeating them.
Because we can only see how much we understand the work we do through the feedback we get through the questions we solve.
Don’t forget to answer a number of questions every day.
The number of questions you will solve may vary depending on what you will do that day; you may not solve a lot of questions in a day when you are working on the subject, but we should still do at least a certain amount of question-solving work in order to see how much we have learned about the subject that day.
Solve the exam:
Another job you should do in the half-year vacation is to solve the test tests.
Even if you haven’t finished all of the subjects, you can at least do the lesson test solutions.
Let’s say that you’ve done a lot of Turkish lesson; you can solve 40 questions prepared Turkish lesson trials.
Do it while you are working.
If you can solve 40 questions in 60 minutes, then you can solve your next goal in a few minutes.
Holidays and hobbies:
Vacation, of course, is not just about studying; you should also spend a few days on vacation, rest and hobbies.
A vacation period that will only be spent studying will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
Therefore, you should also have special times in your plans to set aside for yourself.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing the internet can be part of your plans, most importantly, how much time you will spend.
I would also like to give some advice to those of you who said I didn’t have the first time.
If; my first period has not been very good, I have not worked very hard, and if you say my shortcomings are too many, this semester is a great opportunity for you too.
But first you have to decide and believe it.
In the 2009-2010 season, Turkey scored the most goals between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now you answer the question you asked yourself, is the match over and you are going to the dressing room, or is the match still ongoing and you have a lot of minutes to score goals?
I don’t think anyone wants to say “we’re going to look at the next games now,” which is a classic comment used by a defeated football team coach or players.
All you have to do now is to leave the past and look ahead, not walk.
To summarize what we say:
Make a semester vacation plan first.
2) Repeat things you know.
3) Take care of your missing issues.
4) Resolve the question by resolving the issue.
5) Resolve the test tests.
6) Read the book
Set new goals for the new year.
Take time for yourself, your hobbies and what you enjoy.
Spend time with your family and friends.
10) Spend time on social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnics, etc.)
The car has gone a long way.
With an average of 45 stores of 1,000 square meters each, one of Turkey's largest 'home' store chains, the founder of Kervan, Shinasi Demirel and his son Hasan, joined the home Sweet Home with 17 stores abroad, 25 in the country, to the structure of Kervan.
With the recent completion of business registration operations, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Shinasi Demirel said that there is still no Kervan store abroad, "Now we will continue with the larger store Kervan, the smaller store with Home Sweet Home."
He said, “I’m going to go abroad.”
With the merger of Kervan, which is 90 million TL with Home Sweet Home, the 2015 turnover of 50 million liras, a retail chain of 140 million liras with production also emerged.
Kervan's total sales area with 45 stores in 35 provinces is 45 thousand square meters.
25 of the stores belong to the main company.
There are approximately 500 employees in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 25 stores abroad and has a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and employs 320 people.
Kadir Kalaycıoğlu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Home Sweet Home, which manufactures, exports and stores with its partner Alev Pakten, stated that they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan, "We are Mardin and we entered this sector in 1998."
From the outset, we have been showing up a brand with the support of the Chinatown gentlemen.
Mr. Chenasi is the ‘TRT’ of this sector.
We also learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step to the store by giving us the Ak Central store.
We worked with Kervan not as a rival but as a strategic partner.
“It’s going to be a very serious synergy with this union.”
Kalaycıoğlu said that there are currently 17 overseas stores, including the weight of Home Sweet Home in the Middle East, and that they have also started exporting to China last month.
“We also opened our first corner in Shanghai.”
A chain of 200 stores.
“Then we will develop a large store abroad as Kervan, a small store with Home Sweet Home.”
Poroshenko to sell its factory in Russia
Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, the CEO of Roshen, who interviewed the news site Liga.net on the matter, said the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky, “Yes, we put the factory out for sale.”
“As soon as it goes to sale, all the real buyers are suddenly gone,” he said, stating that there is no buyer.
As for the price of the company’s factory in the Russian city of Lipetsk, Moskalevsky said, “We have determined it to be about $200 million.”
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and sweets a year, is one of the world’s largest producers and is owned by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Star Holding became Pladis abroad
Star Holding merged the global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate industries it bought under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met’s, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ülker brands, a new $5.2 billion food giant with 26,000 employees was born.
Murat Ülker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Star Holding, who spoke at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Star Holding, said: “Being a global company has been our goal since the beginning,” adding:
Murat Ülker broadcasts £335 million sales live on Periscope
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now under the name of Star Holding and is progressing to become a global brand, global company in the world of biscuit chocolate sweetening business.
During this time we have evolved from retail to packaging real estate, personal care and various industries alongside biscuit chocolate sweetening.
We have 77 factories in 14 countries, 300 brands with thousands of sales points.
Ülker, who said that the entire Star Holding formed a "family of more than 50 thousand people", said: "Now when we look at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back and focus on sweetening chocolate biscuits, i.e. our main business and be global in this field; for this we are re-organizing," and said the new construction:
The story of Mr. Sabri's father
We re-evaluate our company, we re-organize.
Divide the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü is responsible for the Turkish Republics of the Middle East, K. Africa and Turkey.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business as well as from the American continent and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of Britain, continental Europe and Africa.
While Ali Ülker, who can be called the quality and innovation guru, will take on global responsibilities in his field, a hundred Karakaş will also help me in the management of the business.
China and Russia will be parts of Southeast Asia which we will newly establish and develop.
Murat Ülker sells shares in SAF GYO
Murat Ülker continued, “We promise happiness to the whole world in every bite,” and “Our global company we founded to this is called Pladis.”
"If you say where you invented Pladix, it doesn't really have a special meaning," he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we are inspired by the name of the Pleiades team star, which consists of seven stars in Latin.
So we translated worldwide.
Ali Ülker, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Star Holding, also stressed that we have "begun to create synergies in innovation" by working with laboratories in different countries and added:
We have valuable AR-GE teams, and by bringing these teams together, we have achieved certain synergies in working on an AR-GE platform so far.
We have 27 R-GE centers under Pladis.
The largest are in Turkey and England.
More than 300 AR-GE experts work here.
Synergy studies have already begun to produce results.
Produced in Ülker and will start exporting to the UK, the drage of Digestives (Nibbles) is produced in Silivri at Ülker's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: Brands are different but the products are the same.
A cracker technology developed in the UK, namely the Jacob's Crinklys product, was adapted to Turkey in a short time, giving our country a beautiful taste under the name of Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı.
Laviva, whom we all know closely, met today with consumers in America.
Call of Duty has exceeded 250 million
Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games’ gold-lettered game series seems to be unforgettable for many years.
Especially the newly revealed sales numbers are proof of how legendary we need to find.
Activision, which holds the license rights to the series, sold 250 million copies at the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company, which shares the total number of sales of the entire series, has sold 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
If you think this is a black ops 3 game, you will not be mistaken.
Kim Kardashian was elected president once again.
In the ordinary Assembly, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected president.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who played the game of 990 of the 238 delegates who voted, became the new president.
248 of the votes used were invalid.
After the announcement of the result, the parties took part in a joyful show.
The CHP had a total of 275 delegates.
He completed his work on Sunday at 10 p.m.
In the sword, he said:
We would like to play the games here, to say the Turks.
But the point is not that we are here.
There is a truth that cannot be governed.
The atmosphere shadows it all.
The reason for this is because of the people who govern the country.
As chiefs, terror comes from wherever it comes, whatever it comes, we oppose it.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done with reason, done with knowledge, done with irfan.
We want to fight for no one’s nose to bleed.
What’s different from the photos in Syria, the photos in Lebanon, the photos in the Southeast?
While sitting at the table, they made serious mistakes.
The power is responsible for the blood, the tears, all the dead.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey that is turning into a lake of blood.
Who is responsible for these?
A taxi driver in the city?
What is Turkey paying?
We will participate in meetings in a sincere way about changing the laws of the coup, and we will convey our thoughts.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone’s personal opinions.
“Come, let’s change the spirit.”
In the morning, because of this country’s bright thoughts, their houses are pressed in the blind, they are arrested.
There are aspects in which we are not involved, but people should be able to express their opinions freely.
This dictatorship is said to be “the one who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state.”
I also want to ask him, why would those who eat the bread of the state and take advantage of all the opportunities of the state not think when stealing the state?
The CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will all prepare for the fourth great revolution together.
Whatever the cost, we will bring free democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, they can do whatever they do, no matter how heavy the price will be, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I’m calling you straightforwardly, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind the law of the blow, the man who was hiding did not throw his mind out of the blow.
You have awarded a Medal of Excellence to the man who taught you.
Which blow are you talking about?
Fully deceiving the people.
Party officials ranked the other three revolutions as follows: the first is the end of the great revolution and the establishment of the republic; the second is the transition from a single-party period to a multi-party period during the Great Revolution; and the third is the transition from a single-party period to a social democracy with Bulent Ecevit.
The president has responsibilities and duties.
The President has the oath in Article 103.
We know how important the concept of name and honor is in this society.
If a man goes out and makes this promise, he will keep it until his death.
Honour and honor are not disputed for us.
The man who is a dictator’s destroyer, what does honor and honor mean to you.
What do you know about the name and honor, why did you make this oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
I want to find out this.
In a religious man, the concept of name and honor is the principal principle.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of the coup, but to arbitrate the law of the coup.
They don’t want a presidential system.
How is the president; the boss-president system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Everyone will do what one orders.
Are Parliamentarians Healthy in Turkey?
No it does not work.
If we bring free democracy, the system works.
They called it a coup, but they strengthened the law of the coup.
The Izmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the general presidency, could not participate in the contest because he could not gather the signatures of the necessary 128 delegates for the nomination.
He said he could collect 92 signatures, “I can’t be a candidate under the current conditions.”
In the Hall of Representatives, there were seats dedicated to members of the Party Assembly (PM), the Central Executive Board (MYK) and the Honorary Council, while former CHP leader Deniz Baykal was noted to sit in the tribunes with the parties.
Gülay Yedekçi, a member of the parliament of Istanbul, instead of sitting in the place left for the members of the parliament, arrived early and sat next to the place left for the Swordman.
The meeting of Yelova’s deputy Muharrem Ince with his son Kılıçdaroğlu was one of the topics discussed in the assembly.
He also stated that he did not accept that he was offered a PM membership.
However, sources from the general center claimed that the request for a meeting came from Ince and that the PM membership was not suggested.
In a tweet, he said: “Nobody can learn from this general center sources, the content of the conversation from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan.”
He said, “How can I find out about the meeting of two people?”
He said, “He’s gone to see you.”
His son often applauded the press.
On the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Assembly" party assembly (PM) stamped the scenes.
The Swordman went home after the meeting and began working for the PM list.
While preparing the key list of 100 people of Kılıçdaroğlu, it was learned from the current MYK members that Yakup Akkaya, who did not apply to PM, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and Seyhan Erdoğdu, who once again was nominated for PM, said they would call the 13 MYK members outside of Seyhan Erdoğdu by phone and place them in the list.
The Swordfather is said to be able to point to the PM key list of 100 people as well as another narrowed list.
In the conclusion statement of 21 articles unanimously adopted by the CHP Assembly, the removal of the honors on the European Local Governance Charter, which arose with the authoritarian discussions of the DTK, was demanded to increase the sharing of powers locally.
The statement also included the objectives of “the end of the party state order” and “the establishment of a rule of law that can give accountability.”
Selçuk Özdağ, general vice president from Kurultay AK Party, Idris Baluken from HDP, Ruhsar Demirel from MHP followed.
AK Party Özdağ and AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu’s harsh criticism of President Erdoğan.
He said, “I saw that I missed the dose of criticism, I couldn’t accept it.”
In the hall, journalists detained Can Dündar and Erdem Gül’s photographs included “How to get out of the darkness to the light if I don’t burn if you don’t burn” with a banner written in Kurdish, Turkish and English “Peace”.
In the early hours of the morning, the group started with commentary and Ahmet Kaya songs.
The message sent to the council by the wife of Diyarbakır Bar President Tahir Ambassador, Turkani Ambassador, who lost his life in an armed attack, received great applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Smile and his father Sami Elvan also joined the board.
The part in which the Swordman said that they would possess “democracy to death” at any cost was the most applauded part of the talk.
So far, the CHP, which has gathered 34 ordinary, 18 extraordinary, including 52 councils, gathered its 53rd major council yesterday in the Ankara Arena.
Participation was high.
There were more than 15,000 chiefs in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm given to the crowd.
The most exciting moment was the memory that Kılıçdaroğlu’s wife, Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu, entered the hall with her.
The excitement continued as the Swordbrother’s son greeted the hall.
There was no discipline in the hall at the party meetings.
Even when the Swordman spoke, there was a great movement in the field part of the arena.
Apparently, the CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to speak to party leaders and journalists about themselves by seeking support.
One CHP leader tried to explain with the words, “It’s better for figurative parties, such as party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union, to sit down like a rope and stay silent,” that this is not a bad thing.
There is a difference between the Chief Executive Officer, the AK Party or the MHP Board.
There are only presidents speaking in these parties.
In the CHP, the assembly becomes a platform where party issues are also discussed.
As the number of parties that wanted to speak to the assembly yesterday increased, the President of the Court, Murat Karayalç, had trouble arranging the time.
In the faces and languages, while being the expression "The country is going badly" there was also a distance from the comments "You will now change the course with the picture that will come out of this hall."
All of the Chiefs had no consistent and strong answer to the question of “what to do” as well as “what to do.”
There is no chance that there will be any elections in the next four years.
When the Swordfather came to the court, we also waited for journalists to answer the question of "what to do".
The Swordfather first answered the question, “What’s happening?”
He drew attention to the issue of imprisoned journalists, to what was done to academics because of the statement, to what happened in the Southeast, to the outcome of foreign policy.
He has long responded to “Anadolu legends” about his party, such as “unreligious party”, “supporting parties”, “party of elites”.
When it came to the "what to do" stage, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to put forward a "strategy".
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome with more justice with a stronger democracy.
He also vowed on behalf of the CHP and "we will work at whatever cost until we bring democracy."
“We will fight to death for democracy.”
A final note; it should be reminded that the CHP has dealt with the "organization" issue in the 53rd assembly, and that it is now able to gather trouble-free assembly.
Meanwhile, the card was printed for 900 journalists who were told to follow the board, but the participation of journalists in the hall was not at that level.
The representatives of the media organizations in Ankara were not as willing as the AK Party councils to follow the board.
Requested to be appointed
The indictment prepared by the District Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Diyarbakır on three of the seven accused detained was accepted by the Fourth Heavy Penal Court.
In the prosecution, it was stated that on instructions and calls of senior executives of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization Diyarbakır, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağri's some districts and neighborhoods made statements under the name of "administration".
In the indictment that the organization's ambassadors and youth and women were called for illegal action, Diyarbakır's Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts recorded an increase in bombed, long-range weapons and rocket attacks on security forces, public institutions and organizations, citizens' homes, workplaces and vehicles.
Fighting with ISIS: Our officers were shot
The conflicts between the Syrian army of Duden, Dude, Black Mezra and the Fatih army formed by ISIS and opposition groups in the Black Bridge village in the opposing Yavuzlu village of Kilis continue to intensify in recent days.
The sounds of guns and guns fired during clashes between ISIS and the opposition near the border are also heard by Turkey.
While smoke rising from areas where explosions often occurred was seen naked by Turkey, security forces on the border line took intense measures with armored vehicles.
On the other hand, harassment fire was opened at the Sheikh Mehmet Border Station near the Yavuzlu village of Kilis from the village under the control of Islamic State militants.
In accordance with the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded to the area where the abuse fire was opened with shells and heavy weapons.
Russian warplanesly attacked the village of Hameyn, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the air bombing were taken to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
Lotus takes checks from the rich
Living in a small home worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, the Robinson couple chose to receive a single payment of $328 million over a 29-year period rather than a total of $528.8 million.
The couple said, “After all, we don’t have a guarantee of tomorrow.”
John Robinson, who works in a store chain, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant alongside a dermatologist, said they would be at the top of their jobs on Monday, even though they are now millionaires.
The couple aims to pay their home loan debt primarily with the money they earn and to help their relatives.
It was revealed that the grand prize was divided into three.
iOS9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System, Apple Update Released
By going to the Settings app for the new operating system, you can tap "Generate" and select "Update Software".
When ready, your phone will offer you the option of downloading and installing.
Some users experienced a problem after this installation and received an error message saying “Software update failed.”
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for system loading to decrease or try iTunes and upgrade from there.
The phone will guide you during the rest of the process.
You can also delete apps to open space – but Apple has prevented this from happening by minimizing the update, and suggests some apps to be deleted and uses a dedicated tool for reinstalling when the process is over.
While updating continues, it’s worth making sure that your phone is charged or that it’s next to a charger so that your battery doesn’t run out.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update, as the phone may stop halfway to shut down the update.

FedEx revenue mixed, financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx disappointing results for the past three months, and the freight giant lowered its profit forecast for the whole year due to decreased demand for freight services and rising costs in ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year at this time, FedEx announced it would recruit 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The opening gong of Wednesday fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-open transactions 45 minutes before the opening.
FedEx Corp. said it expected a profit of $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending in May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on a survey conducted by FactSet.
Despite an average upgrade of 4.9 per cent that will apply on January 4 and the high charges that will begin in November on land cargo for heavy or large packages, there seems to be a possibility of a decline.
According to the company, cost cuts, higher revenue and e-commerce growth are expected to continue to result in higher profits than in the previous year.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “has demonstrated a solid performance, especially despite the weak economic conditions expected in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competing firm UPS said UPS plans to hire the same number of additional workers, 90,000 to 95,000, as it did last year.
Over the three-month period ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million in revenue, up 6% from the previous year.
Profit per share stood at $2.42 behind the $2.44 forecast of the 12 analysts reviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit last year by a downturn in international priority shipping, which caused revenue stagnation in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping has boosted the results of FedEx Local Services.
In the last quarter, land services revenue increased by 29%, but operating revenue essentially stagnated due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
During the high labor costs in cargo business income dropped, the express unit saw high base rates due to high income.
In pre-open trades about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares fell to $150,15 with a drop of $3.85 or 2.5%.
They closed Tuesday with a drop of 11% for the year and 17% below the record level of 11 June.
At the most anticipated meetings of years, Federal Reserve politicians have decided this week to spend two days around a Honduras mauna table of 27 pounds and it’s time to raise interest rates once in almost a decade.
The two-story meeting room, located on a wing of the central bank, will be the wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed’s female chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues hold the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Big Bang, Fed leaders have admitted that there is a third unwritten authority: the financial balance.
And this third advocacy may be X factor too close to a unpredictable decision on whether or not the unique stimulus support from the US economy’s ongoing near-zero short-term interest rates, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to start cutting.
While most data economies show that they’re growing steadily, the latest turbulence in global financial markets could scare current cautious Fed officials to add vulnerability by raising reference federal fund interest rates – even by less than a quarter percent.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they’ll be following,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they are looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer.”
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, and this in itself leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists interviewed by Bloomberg recently expected a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait with the main indicator, which only shows a 30-percent probability of a rise.
This could indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate and policy makers do not mitigate its impact by promising that another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to 16,599.85 points, up by 228.89 points or 1.4 percent.
John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group, said: “The increase was triggered by the expectation that policy makers will keep the ratio steady this week.”
“It would be surprising if the Fed raised interest rates right now.”
If the Fed ruled in this direction, “they would have had to take a long year to calm the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts have suggested that a rate hike due to the lifting of the silk curtain on when the Fed will take action could calm financial markets.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25 points this month, which would be a small step toward slowly narrowing currency conditions, strengthening the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said that despite the liberals’ complaints about the need for a more economic process, he expects this year’s rate increase in the spring and early summer.
Although the rate of job creation decreased in August, growth in the labor market has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate dropped last month to 5.1 percent, the lowest level in seven years, approaching the level the Fed estimates full employment.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And while inflation continues to look below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed politicians say the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices is a major reason.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy “can cope with higher rates and needs it despite the tightness of the labor market.”
But financial markets around the world began to shake after China’s currency went into devaluation at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 16 percent of the record level in May due to investors’ fears that a slowing Chinese economy will slow down global growth.
The market jumped back somehow when the Dow was now below 10% of its high in May.
The Fed’s market turmoil for policymakers makes it even more complicated to calculate when the interest rate will be raised.
Stephen D. Oliner, senior research partner at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official, said: “They may have been slightly narrowed at this meeting over the past few weeks with the unknowledge of what’s most in the financial markets in the Chinese economy and the lack of news about economic weakening.”
He now predicts that they will wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
"There is so much uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be, and they have almost no data in their hands to link the advance of developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s primary concerns, so it should not be a factor in land acquisition processes technically.
The Fed has become the global monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
Until then, the only hint from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could “remove” the monetary generalization triggered by global market shocks.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only follow developments elsewhere, but also consult other central bank executives and experts to better study the global economy.
Asset management firm Envestnet Inc’s global strategy chief Zachary Karabell said the decision-making process is “more than a science talent.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond vice president Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that “the Fed has overreacted in the past to unlikely financial market movements linked to economic foundations.”
Lacker, a voting member of the policy maker Federal Open Market Committee, who pressured for rate increases, referred to 1998-99 resolutions as an example.
Lacker said "despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth," the financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut the index rate by 0.75 percent over the three meetings.
A year later, the Fed officials recovered those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, one of the former members of the Bank of England’s rate determination committee, said: “The Fed should only prioritize financial balance concerns during major crises, as in the 2008 market collapse.”
He said he is not approaching this level.
You don’t really want to stay in fear of going to a rate rise because the markets are upset, said Peterson International Economic Institute president Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and it doesn’t talk about the financial balance sheet and I don’t think they should take any action in that direction until that changes.

Brazil’s Rio Grande Pediatric Society encourages healthy eating during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS resorted to a shocking method by placing images of milk babies depicted with descriptions of unhealthy nutrients to try and tell women the importance of healthy eating during breastfeeding processes.
Human milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to their extra energy needs, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, recent research shows that the nutritional supplements that mothers should take are not limited to the calorie intake.
A new study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas found that healthy eating of pregnant women protected them from tumor development by affecting the genetic expression of their babies.
Unfortunately, unhealthy eating has been found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to outperform in ratings despite Nine's efforts to capture the lead in the Today Show
The moves Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra to overthrow the leadership of the Liberal failed to deliver a rating boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Rival Sunrise, hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck between weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
As the issue of distance does not make much difference for Australian viewers, Sunrise has an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals, compared to Today’s 339,000 figure.
Today recorded a slight increase in ratings on Monday (317,000) compared to last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been closing up with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, the average of Today was 318,000, compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the average of Sunrise is 349,000, compared to Today’s 314,000 figure.
This is the most interesting thing all morning.
The winds of change are affecting the parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are good, thank you for asking!

The great news for Seven was the breathtaking start of The 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seafront in New Zealand with two children has reached a very impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could perform a solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday was a “yes” response.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily beating Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven mixed their nightly fate with two Follow-Australia.
The first half-hour of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00-17:30) reached an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30-18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday Night Track-Australia's first half-hour reached an average of 520,000 viewers, while in the second half-hour this figure rose to 720,000.
The hot seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australia’s second night’s rating drop to Nine suggested that the Hot Seat would give a superiority at 5.30.
Follow Australia was an accomplished change of the Million Dollar Minute that didn’t pass the teeth to McGuire’s show.
It was originally released in the form of Sunrise comes up as local as Today remains.
The last three people think Single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but which one will he choose?
Has the secret been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed who will win.
Sam Wood’s woman to choose at the end of the Single program was kept in great secret.
And the other three girls do their best not to tell who the last rose field is.
But if we control Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski the day before the three fell into two, they might have given a hint without knowing who the winner would be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final
The three women also explained in a lyrical language why Wood was perfect; they said why they wanted to be her partner, emphasizing her humor, ambition, family values, and a positive attitude.
But their answers to the question, “Who should get Wood’s last rose if not you?” may include information about who will win The Bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood apart from themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been close since the first day.
Jeavons-Fellows: “From the moment I got home, I felt that reading [Sarah’s] energy and Sam’s energy matched each other, and I thought so throughout the program.”
Markoski added, “Sarah is a very practical person, it’s so fun to be around her.”
I saw them together and there is a chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a very good couple.
Mackay said last week’s home visitor appointments meant he thought Wood was the “right person.”
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game - I'm now totally attached to him."
When asked who Wood could choose if he didn’t, it was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that.”
"I love the other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor is broadcast on Ten Channel on Wednesday at 19.30.
First release: Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options in terms of where he would start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle themselves showed a lot of interest in him after he moved to the U.S., and many other teams approached him after the impressive day of outdoor training last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches seated Hayne back because of his loss in performance in the Australian rugby league, as in a 20-3 win against Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed the man and gave Hayne another chance to take part in a game after Reggie Bush’s disability.
After the game, Tomsula continued to show her true color in the dressing room.
Instead of humiliating them in front of the whole team, he dared them.
Tomsula also explicitly supported Hayne in the post-match press conference.
Cam Inman, a reporter for the 49ers, said Hayne was also encouraged by private team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget this drop and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused Minnesota Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball
This wasn’t what Hayne and his widespread Australian fans dreamed of for their first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen crippling out of the field after dropping the ball, and then told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he could not think of a worse start for his NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, “This was just one of those things, you’re sorry for the next game and that’s it.”
Hayne also reminded the 2007 Origin's first match with Queensland's rebound score.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a post on Instagram after the game while holding an Australian flag with fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the wealthiest man in Russia, was arrested in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who was openly opposed to President Vladimir Putin, was jailed, oil company Yukos was seized, and pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
Police in Nepal kill four people after plastic bullets were dropped on protesters
A police official said on Wednesday that as a result of police firing with plastic bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution in the country, four people, including a 4-year-old boy, died.
The incident occurred on Tuesday night in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Provincial chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 phased protesters gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal said the police used pepper gas and fired into the air before using plastic bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It’s not clear why plastic bullets, which are known to kill but are generally a less deadly alternative, result in such a high mortality rate.
The clash was the latest of weeks-long violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the regions created by the proposed new constitution will dilute their own political influence.
Tharus ethnic groups seeking to establish their own state are also protesting in western Nepal.
In violent clashes since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed.
At that time, four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions — which is also seen as an important but restless creative step in preparing a new constitution in Nepal, which has been ruled by the central state for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that occurred in April and killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have been working on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new text will be arranged until Sunday.
NHC says 60 percent chance of hurricane in southern Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a large low-pressure system as far south as 350 miles (560 km) of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also observed between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said the chance of a tropical hurricane occurring in the next two days was 60 percent.
Google launches donation matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced a $11 million funding campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google announced its donation initiative on its blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of an executive making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
"There was hunger, thirst, cold and fear along with a lot of dark buses and train trips on our journey," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe grows, many families, like my family, need help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Rescue for Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest cause of which is the four-year Syrian civil war that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
They are also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars.

Diabetes patients with moderate obesity may help with weight loss surgery
According to a new study, it may take at least five years for moderate obesity patients with type 2 diabetes to see the benefits of obesity surgery.
But it is still too early to tell patients with moderate obesity diabetes that they live longer than those who have not undergone surgery after obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote a new study on JAMA surgery and an expert on obesity surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality rates to identify themselves."
Weight loss surgeries, also known as bariatric surgery, use a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on advanced obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, which is measured by the boyle ratio of a kilogram, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A person with a BMI of 25 or more is considered overweight and a person with a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese.
BMI can be calculated from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan’s full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital used data from experiments that compared two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and tubular stomach surgery – used in the treatment of moderate obesity patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007.
From the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5.
The BMI of those treated for non-surgical diabetes remained steady around 29.
Diabetes was partially resolved in 36% of those who had surgery and in 28% of those who had surgery.
In comparison, in the group treated with medicines, diabetes was solved only in 1% completely and only in 2% partially.
The authors also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were generally better in the “surgical group.”
The researchers also imaged blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflected the blood sugar rate in patients over time.
According to the researchers, the best way to keep hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c dropped from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
But with adjusted hemoglobin A1c levels, this better “glycemic control,” according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues who conducted the research, has not reduced the mortality rate in these five years.
The research team compared the findings with these two types of surgeries.
In the fifth year, the group with tubular stomach surgery gained more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 to 2.1) dropped more, and the likelihood of overall diabetes decline increased (46.9 to 16.7).
While the study did not show a clear benefit in survival after surgery at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said they had valid data that the surgery extended life expectancy, according to a study conducted in more obese patients in Sweden.
In this Swedish study, obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than another group who had undergone conventional treatment.
Although this new study did not show what the benefits were for surviving surviving patients, according to Blackstone, this situation is relevant and rejuvenating for those with BMI below 35.
This is also the most devastating part of the article because it says this surgery is safe in the group with a low BMI, and there has been no increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking weight loss seriously as a patient’s BMI drops below 27 to 30.
I think we’ve waited long enough for people to take the matter seriously.
I think it’s really hard to reverse it after they have accumulated these genetic changes in their bodies that have linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said that Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leaders have called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain, the Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford, which will work on ethical issues.
Under current conditions, he argued that the interests of countries or continents should prioritize the interests of mankind.
At the same time, although appreciated, he also stressed that the response of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis is inadequate in this regard.
In his speech, he said, “It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe.”
While he appreciated the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said it was only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of several thousand refugees is great, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and sustainable development to these Muslim countries, primarily through education,” he said.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce power usage.
The use of power has never been the solution to problems.”
Referring to the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to what George Bush did after the September 11 attacks, saying that the U.S.’s violent responses have launched an uncontrollable chain of events.
In my letter to President Bush after September 11, I expressed my wishes for good health and expressed that the way to solve this problem was through non-violent methods.
I know that his prophecy was good-intentioned, but he himself used force and caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
The number of children who swallow hand antiseptics has increased four times in the last four years.
Poison control centers in the United States have an increase of almost 400 percent in high-alcohol swallowing of wet diapers seen in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand swallowing of antiseptics in children under 12 years of age to the center increased from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN, “Children have become more interested in these kinds of products, and unfortunately there are those among them that need to be removed urgently.”
Some children said they deliberately drank their hand antiseptics, while others said they did so in an attempt to impress their friends or a social media claim.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking antiseptics for cheap drunkenness.
Some teenagers have been to mix the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwashes to get a harder breath.
Young children can be captivated by the attractive antiseptic smells.
Lopez said, “The child doesn’t think it’s a bad thing.”
And most of them are more attractive.
Hand antiseptics with the aroma of berries, grapes and oranges are available, which are extremely attractive to children.
Hand antiseptics contain between 45% and 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few storms can cause alcohol poisoning.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, president of the Center for Poisoning at the University Hospital of Kansas, told Kansas City television channel Fox 4, “It’s high concentration of alcohol.”
You don’t leave a few glasses of whiskey out, but people leave these hand antiseptics high-medium, which is an easy way for children to get a fairly large amount of alcohol.
Recently, the six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed the stinking hand antiseptic of only four stitches of strawberries at school, was urgently removed to receive treatment.
His blood alcohol level was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency care doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, the rate was twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult.
Nhaijah couldn’t pronounce the words and couldn’t walk when he came to the emergency room.
Rithey that because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her under custody for the night in a separate children’s hospital despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN she was “very frightening.”
It could be deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or shorten the contact of the antiseptic diapers with the skin and put them in places that children cannot reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died from swallowing a hand antiseptic containing a poisonous substance that did not reveal its name.
Health officials have argued that the substance could not be ethyl alcohol as stated in the list of substances, but methyl alcohol, which has a deadly effect.
In January, three fourth-grade students from northern New York plotted to “place antibacterial products around the classroom” in an attempt to poison “bad-hearted” teachers, according to police reports.
The teacher prohibited her use in class because she was highly allergic to the hand antiseptic.
This plan, which was brought before the police, was described as "a futile attempt" and proposed disciplinary punishment to the school administration.

Two weeks ago they murdered Miray Ince in the Sur neighborhood of Şırnak.
He was 3 months.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him too.
What can we say is that they killed Joseph Oliveira in Silopi on January 3.
He was running away from aliens.
They searched for a safe place for him.
His wife was with him.
One day later, they killed Angel Albaydin at the breakfast table in Diyarbakır, in the street with a small transit.
A few days later, Aliens set fire to the school.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students have since fled.
On 10 January, the bodies of three men who were killed as a result of the attacks in Hazreti Hüseyin Camii in the Sheikh Harun Boy neighborhood were left behind.
Two days ago, three children lost their lives in the district.
An unidentified body with 1 ton of explosives destroyed the lives of these little ones.
There are dead, and there are wounded.
Who is guilty?
Fellowship of course.
Cappuccino is fake.
No, it’s not the crap.
The cow is innocent!
The murderer is outside, shaking his arm and staring at our faces.
Some people try to draw their attention in another direction.
While the killer is in front of us, it creates opportunities to escape him instead of pointing to the killer.
The murderer is sick.
He hides it.
After he is lost in sight, he tells the person who comes before him that he is not actually guilty.
The sides of the struggle we have lived in the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants to shrink the circle of fire around us and burn us.
Someone is trying to stop it, and others are trying to extinguish the fire around us.

Without traitors, they were taken away by white men.
Members of the PKK terrorist organization, who are stuck in the corner between them in the neighborhood, find the remedy to blend and escape between the citizens with white flags.
The security forces are using the GBT to prevent the breach.
With the peace and democracy operations that began on July 23, the organization’s activist power in the districts, which has become unable to take action, is also breaking down, causing a major blow in the countryside and beyond the border.
According to sources in the region, the organization’s arms and ammunition warehouse was seized in Silopi.
Some citizens fleeing the attacks of the terrorist organization PKK are fleeing the conflict points with white flags in their hands under the control of police and soldiers.
Terrorists who were stuck in the streets and could not find a place to escape also started to flee with white flags, interfering with citizens.
Security units are also conducting general information gathering (GBTI) inquiries about suspects.
In Silopi, a PKK terrorist was said to have interfered with the public with a white flag, but when he realized he would be caught during the GBT interrogation, he tried to escape and was disabled.
Commanders will care.
From districts carefully monitored in the region, soldiers and police also struck a massive blow to the terrorist organization in Zizre.
It is said that the Yafes neighborhood where the militants were housed was largely cleaned up.
Customer teams, formed from police and gendarmerie special operational units, completed their tasks and left their places to commanders.
Commanders stationed in the Yafes neighborhood are also taking precautions to prevent the terrorists from infiltrating again.
In other districts, the security in the neighborhoods where customer teams clean up terrorists will be left to commanders.
Police and soldiers 1 ton baklava
Kilis Municipality sent 1 ton of baklava to special operations police and soldiers who were serving in difficult conditions in Cizre, Sur and Silopi.
Mayor Hasan Kara, who declared that they cursed terror, said: “May the Lord give strength and strength to our security forces that protect their homeland and their people by performing their duties in difficult conditions.”
He said: “We desire the mercy of Allah for our servants, and urgent healing for our guards.”
They told the horror night.
People reacted strongly to the attack.
Most of the houses surrounding the explosions were uninhabitable.
The neighborhood residents said, “My son was injured, but we couldn’t get out of the house because of the sounds of guns.
We were able to take my son to the hospital in an hour."
Sabiha Özcan said her wife was injured, saying, “My wife was injured when she slept in the room.
He was dragged to the door.”
They were in the blood.
He said, “I am cursing those things.
14 people were killed on the road.
A bus carrying skiers from Japan's ski areas in Karuizawa was overthrown by losing control.
In the accident, 14 of the group died and 27 were injured.
Authorities said the bus crashed into a barrier falling from about 3 meters in height.
There was no freezing on the road and an investigation has been launched.
50 kilometers of concrete road have been demolished.
Alexander Protopopov, the head of a prison in the Koni region of Russia, was arrested on charges of selling a 50-kilometer concrete road built on the highway.
It was revealed that between 2010 and 2015, Protopopov used his position to remove and sell some of the concrete placed on the highway to make a profit of $80,000 (243 thousand TL).
15 million liras for 7,750 euros
A woman named Viola Colombo, who lives in the Italian city of Venice, won the right to convert the £15 million she found in an old box from an online auction site e-Bay into euros.
In 2014, the central bank rejected Colombo’s wish to convert the former Italian currency into euro.
Colombo, whom the court found right, will be charged €7,750 (approximately £26,000).
UNESCO calls for a non-woman island
Japan applied for an entry into the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2017 for the island of Okinawa, where only men were allowed to walk because of the temples on it.
But the island’s royal class is opposed to this decision with concerns about the “tourist future”.
Saudi Arabia has not given up on Turkey
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık, Turkey Scientific and Technical Research Institute (TUBITAK) developed ballistic image analysis and recognition system (BALISTIKA) new agreement for the sale of the second batch to Saudi Arabia, stated, "BALISTIKA number will serve in Saudi Arabia from 6 to 14 with the agreement that covers the development and installation of the 8 system."
Light was found in statements about BALISTIKA developed by the TÜBITAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
Light said the system's ballistic examinations of guns, bullet nuclei and bullet nuclei seized in the incidents enabled comparison with the data found in the central database, so that the problems that ballistic experts encountered when examining the bullet nuclei and bullet nuclei disappeared.
Light indicated that data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information could be questioned by storing together thanks to BALISTIKA.
Light, who noted that one of the most important features of BALISTIKA is its ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that gives more detail and fewer errors, emphasized that the innovations brought by the system enabled the ballistic specialist to make decisions quickly and that its success increased significantly.
The SUBA-1 project was launched.
Light, drawing the gold that BALISTIKA met all the criteria in the success criteria and received full notes from the Security General Directorate, noted that the system established in 10 different regions including Ankara at the beginning covered all of Turkey.
Light said that as a result of the success of the system was opened abroad, it was exported as part of the "SUBA-1 Project" carried out with Saudi Arabia and in 2013 its installation in 6 regions was successfully completed.
Light said that a new deal was made for the sale of the second batch of BALISTIKA to Saudi Arabia, the SUBA-2, which is the continuation of SUBA-1, was signed, and the number of BALISTIKA will serve in Saudi Arabia from 6 to 14 with the agreement that covers the development and installation of the additional 8 systems.
Fossils of bus size found
It has been that the prehistoric sea timber has been found to be 10 meters long and 3 tons heavy.
Only the length of the skull was measured at 1.6 meters.
Researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published their findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, who co-authored the paper, said the fossil, which is believed to be 130 million years old, is "almost the size of a bus."
Fanti, speaking to the Washington Post, said the giant-sized saltwater threshold was “at least at the top of the food chain in a certain region at that time.”
Paleontologists have revealed that the M. rex, believed to be the largest timber that lives in the sea, was hunted in the lagoons.
It is believed that the largest freshwater tiger in history was "Sarcosuchus imperator", who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 meters in length and 8 tons in weight.
Everyone’s minds are confused.
Ece Temelkuran's first 1996 book, "All Women's Heads Are Confused", was adapted to the theatre with the same name by Aysa Production Theatre.
Sea Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, Silk Turks, Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Shebnem Sönmez direct the game played by Selen Uçer.
The game, where Uçer’s first-time experience of writing and directing, still continuing with the games ‘Poz’ and ‘Dry Strong’, questiones the confusion in women’s heads.
The game met the audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The play begins with the radio.
In the darkness, a voice that leads us back to past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman stood by the window and jumped down.
Who he was and why he attempted suicide is understood by the interference of his neighbors.
Leave a letter
"Ebru Uysal", played by Sea Chakır, is a popular author.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that’s not the only reason.
There have been things in it since childhood.
His failure to taste his father’s love, his exclusion from student life, his lonely childhood, his misrelations, his thought of being incomprehensible, brought him to this point.
He left a letter behind and decided to commit suicide, but he could not jump out of the window.
Because the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Shebnem Sönmez) sitting in the opposite apartment with the neighboring apartment's cleaner and cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde) keeps her foolish.
They are approaching the situation as if it were a normal process.
She becomes more restrained and can’t concentrate.
When the conversation between the three is joined by the famous singer "Meltem Kaya" who cleansed his house, the incident turns into a row.
Meltem, who approaches the situation in a naive and intimate way, can’t stop singing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt gains a different size when the real estate owner 'Murat' (Kadir Çermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The singer's 'Meltem' deceiving information to the press is doing things out of the way.
In the game is also used the "Street Girl" song of Nazan Prel.
Laughing at me
For the first time, he managed to ensure the pace and fluidity of the game.
The comedy load of the game is drawn from Silk Turkey with Zeynep Kankonde.
Types of cartoons they portray; their mimics, their replicas, manage to make the audience laugh.
While Shebnem Sönmez translates the experience of years to the stage very well, the Sea Chakır also shows a convincing performance in reflecting the depressive mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who talks about his name with Tolga Steel's award-winning film 'Sarmaşık', accompanies these four women successfully.
The only curtain play described as a comedy is laughing without confusion.
Most of the good words that come from the mouth of the Perran that I play with Shebnem Sönmez in my mind are: They read the Chalakem, they see the Chalakem, they live.
All children have thought of dying once to punish their parents and why they have always cried at the end of the thought.
The woman hanged in the air like an unexplained joke.
A woman is always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with a sort of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can’t withstand backward things.
People wonder where they put their hands.
Our hands are multiplied.
People talk about what they don’t know, they think about what they do.
A misunderstanding is true.
All women’s heads are confused because they are confused.
If you can’t die, you have a chance to live.

Emotional letters from small students
The police and soldiers who conducted terrorist operations in the region, including the central district of Sur in Diyarbakır, received letters from children in the West for moral purposes.
At the beginning of 75.
At the beginning of the year, the Republic Primary School of Istanbul Western Ataşehir High School of Natural Sciences and Eskişehir Ataçağ High School students began their coordinated work.

The children subsequently sent their work to the district security department.
The district security department set up an exhibition table on the work coordinated by the children in the west.
The exhibition in the new building of the Department of Security was placed for the students' work.
The exhibition was visited primarily by police officers and citizens who operated in the Security Department building.
People who read letters and pictures with meaningful writings and poems were emotionally touched.
A student who wrote a letter related to the operations in the Central Sur district said in the letter, “Our beloved police are grateful to you for your sacrifices to protect innocent people in Diyarbakir.”
It was that the exhibition will last until next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
Germany’s prime minister Angela Merkel, who has been criticized for her refugee policy, has given the name to a refugee baby.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who managed to flee the war in Syria and reach the German city of Duisburg, and his wife Tema El Havar, 21, named their first children "Angela Merkel".
Speaking to the German press, Tema El Havar said: “We are grateful that we are here.

Putin is spitting.
Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "can do business with Russia" if Turkey cannot meet the services offered by other means, while the Russian Tour Operators Association has also stated that "Russian citizens are not abandoning Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculated that the rupture of existing economic ties with Turkey would bring additional costs to Russia, prepared and published a new draft of "emergency situations" concerning Turkey to the Russian government.
According to the draft Federal Regulation, even if Russia falls under sanctions when necessary, Turkish companies and firms will be allowed to do business with Russia.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources outside of Turkey or in cases where domestic production in Russia would bring serious additional costs, Turkish companies and companies could benefit from their products and services.
Which Turkish goods and services will be included in this category will be determined by the Karma Commission, which will be established in cooperation with other relevant ministries within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
Thus, the bureaucrats will be bound to decide which Turkish company can work with Russia.
According to the same document, private companies with state agencies in Russia will have to prove to the Commission that their business with Turkish partners is not lawful.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government, a register of licensed Turkish companies in Russia will also be established.
The Russian Tour Operators Association said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens would not abandon Turkey.
“Despite the ban on tour sales and the Russian Foreign Ministry’s advice not to go to Turkey, our citizens began to look for a formula to organize their holidays on their own.”
The number of posts on social networks entitled "The most practical and cheapest way to go on holiday in Turkey" is growing.
The most common suggestion is to book hotels online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the fall of oil prices below $30 as a “dramatic” development for Russia.
Medvedev said: "It was a very bad surprise for our government, just as no one thought that the oil would fall to $30.
It seems that it will not be possible to fulfill the budget as it is now.”
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
Following the crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that economic sanctions will be tightened.
In those days, our businessmen who are trying to go to Russia in the order we are accustomed to, your staff is officially pulling out at the border gates.
Turkish goods are carried out in customs and are kept under unintended controls.
It has been a long time since, and a few days ago, he arrived in Moscow.
So or so, it makes me softer.
But why ?
The reason is very simple.
In an era of such globalization of the economy, your efforts to shut down the border doors with the methods of a century ago to turn political clashes into economic warfare are no longer discouraging.
We are still writing about Iran and how the economic embargo that has been in place for years has been shattered.
Two neighbouring countries, Russia and Turkey, which seem to be very friendly but in essence not so much, actually need each other.
Technically it is not possible to separate these two countries, with a businessman, a tourist, an entrepreneur, a customer, in one night.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other’s country by foot.
It is better for them to make a political dispute on the table without creating a new Reza Zarrab (Rıza Sarraf).
Without infesting the economy.

As part of the investigation, the police determined that the cases of the incident were M.M.G (43) and R.O (32) and determined that citizens copied card information with the help of the "card copying system" and "mini camera" that the suspects placed in ATMs in different parts of Turkey.
Those who learned the card passwords were identified to trade with these cards.
The operators were arrested during the operation.
Teams examining the computer that M.M.G. and R.O. used on their knees captured numerous video recordings of the mini-camera arrangement set up to seize passwords from citizens operating in ATMs, determining that the murderers stayed shortly when they went to avoid being caught.
It was also revealed that the criminals earned an unfair profit of £50,000 by copying on 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects who were brought to court after their security operations were arrested.
Authorities have warned citizens to regularly check their account movements against such incidents and to curtain their hands when entering passwords in ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad to be tried in Lahey
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders has said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Lahore.
Speaking at a conference he attended in Lahey, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the refugee flow.
Koenders, who pointed out that peace in Syria would not be possible as long as Assad was in power, noted:
Assad must be tried at the UCM in Lahore.
Anyone who has so much blood in his hands must be held accountable before the court.
Assad is also the only one responsible for the refugee flow we are currently facing.
However, I am aware that Assad will not be leaving office soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs its help in this area.

There is no disagreement in Celtic.
While Deila acknowledges that the Hoops are in the wrong place and will overcome it, Griffith doesn’t care about the disagreement in Celtic.
The struggle of hearts, the SFA's punishment for Neilson and Warburton's fearfulness in the face of January's signatures that disrupt Team unity
Lider Don's made a five-point difference with Celtic
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half brought Aberdeen a justified victory over Don against Hamilton in Pittodrie, and gave Don the chance to create a five-point difference between themselves and the Celtic.
Griffith doesn’t care about disagreement.
The rumors of disharmony in Celtic pushed Griffith back and forth, indicating that he and his teammates were not in any way pressured under an increased sense of watchfulness as they prepared to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are impatient for it.
The Scots' absence of the title race also annoys the Dutch Boer
Ronald de Boer, the former midfielder of the Rangers and former international renowned player of Dutch football, says Dutch football enthusiasts have lost interest in Celtic because they don’t compete with the Rangers.
De Boer, who has already been an Ajax ambassador, said: "They no longer provide summaries of Celtic matches in the Netherlands, why?"
The Rangers are no longer there.
People don’t just talk about making the Rangers back.
Talk about the old team.
When they talk about teams, they are interested in it.
The tension in the old team’s matches was high and those who wanted to watch those matches were not just Scots.
He vowed to fix things.
RONNY Deila acknowledged that Celtic was fighting, but the Norwegian boss stated that it would be the opposite.
The defeat against Malmö, followed by a defeat immediately after the Champions League match, against Aberdeen, now in the lead with a five-point difference in the scoring table.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad days in the past, and we will be back again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know that the situation is very frustrating and that many people are angry or sad about what happened.
We are in the same situation - but we have to continue.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes these players feel so much better.
It is so important to stay together.
Warburton's January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago that some January transfer targets were set, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is afraid of signing, insisting when Ibrox doesn’t want to break the team’s unity.
The former Brentford teacher said: “The house transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players coming in the summer, there’s a pre-season period to get them used to, which we’ve seen in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic to retire from Michu
Michu from Swansea forets was linked to Celtic in the transfer window and dismissed predictions that he could retire when his contract with the Eagles expired.
At the age of 29, he suffered unbearable pain from a troublesome ankle for two years and couldn’t find a way out of Wales in the summer.
Hearts prepare for SFA battle on Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, Hearts were 2-1 ahead and then they lost 3-2, reversing everything after the defense player’s red card—Collum’s third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn’t give up on what he said, insisting: “I never questioned the union, I never commented on the performance.”
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
Obsessed Hibee was upset when he spoke a song containing aggressive words about former Heart Actor Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh in March 2014 before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby game and there was the heat of that moment," the attacker said, adding, "I can definitely say that I will not go to Tynecastle except to play with Celtic afterwards.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly is still confident that the management team of the Dundee United board will fix things - but they agree that the downturn on the pitch should end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will get the kids ready to go again,” Donnely said.
McLness is pleased with Hamilton's "grim win"
Derek Mclness admits that, thanks to the Aberdeen team’s first-half penalty of Adam Rooney, the league had to hopelessly hold them against Hamilton Accies to see Celtic’s upper-seventh consecutive victory bringing them to the top of the five-point pitch.
McLnnes said: “No team wins anything without winning matches in this way, whether it’s in cups or leagues.”

Why I'm a Witness of an Execution in Oklahoma
In the coming hours today, I will be watching a man’s murder due to a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if so, I’ll sit as Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly injection in the death chamber viewing gallery in Oklahoma State Prison.
He wanted me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and no matter how shocked I was, I accepted.
As that day approached, I began to be afraid.
Why am I doing this?
I accepted it because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It offers a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and as there is more practice than there is now, a terrible lottery emerges when deciding who to be elected.
Oklahoma dropped its media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watched without his feelings being caught.
I cannot do it.
I’ll sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have also developed a relationship with him over the past few months as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials said I could not be both a witness and a journalist, so I would not be given a pencil and a book to record what I saw.
I will try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of defying my neutrality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
He also agreed that he “could put it out better” but still thinks what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me on some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and if he did, I’t accept it.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list whenever he wanted.
But an international journalist wants to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading it to the public will help the anti-death penalty action.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I will not repeat all the details here.
I have no idea that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What they did after Barry Van Treese’s death was enough to make him a criminal partner.
But I still believe he is not guilty of the murder.
I do not believe there is sufficient evidence to justify a death penalty.
I think his execution was wrong.
I will look at his death from this perspective.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
You can look at other journalists here.
The impressions you will get from me will be the impressions you will get from watching the death of a loved one who was unnecessarily killed.
After police chase, the man was persuaded from the Canning River
Canning Vale police officer remained dry as he persuaded the man to get out of the Canning River.
The allegation of a man from Perth escaping from the police car behind ended up in a shallow and muddy water where a police officer attempted to “convince him to gently return to the shore.”
Canning Vale police were summoned on Tuesday for the incident of unauthorized entry into Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man entered the Canning River and tried to escape from the police.
He could not get far away.
“High Commissioner Shandell Castledine himself stood in the water and said, ‘I won’t go out, come and take me.’”
Police officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Deputy Commissioner Castledine said, “Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape.”
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a lasting example in mind.
In 2006, a cousin left his car to escape alcohol control and tried to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but it inspired the locals to plan a joke Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims he was spying on him and threatening to quit the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria riders tried to prepare a raft in their stalls last year and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the squad and unit department and said they were conducting a personal campaign against her to kick Lady Tatai out of the race at their last meal for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do his best in races and told Lidari that he found himself in power conditions he couldn’t explain when kobalt gave a positive result.
The spy said he had been biting his tongue for 18 months, saying he didn’t want to “look like a wretched grape.”
“I’t say this and I’ve been shut up for a long time, but sometimes you’re so upset and everything happens suddenly,” Moody said.
They know it continues.
Sometimes you react and endure the consequences, and I will endure the consequences of what I say.
When I go home tonight, I will sleep.
I want to move my head straight and let my bosses know that I try to do my best for them.
It means that when they start to think I don’t do it, I should no longer be an employee.
I wonder what to do with my license.
Moody's previously detonated a bomb in an interview with racing.com accusing the unit department of spying on its own field.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — I’ll call him if asked — and offered to give him a job in my ranch in exchange for telling them what I’m doing in my ranches,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I am a triangle.
If that’s the case, they’ll all have to return their letters because they weren’t skilled enough to catch me.
RVL’s former chairman Robert Roulston, RVL’s new chairman David Moodie and RVL’s current CEO knew this then and now.
Should it make me feel personal?
Does RVL have a number of balls and wants to make those outside employers responsible for what happens in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people outside think I am.
Maybe they need to take my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I said will make them think.
But I don’t matter anything at the point where I came, and that annoys me.
This really saddles me.
I will put pressure on them, I will put responsibility on them to decide.
I have the support of my family and I walk.
The disappointment that the employer experienced due to the long-running cobalt investigation into Lidari and the subsequent scratch incident led him to say “throw my license at the end of the table.”
Famous for preparing the invincible champion Black Hawk, Moody called the rule of racing day care "laughable" and stated that dragging mud or clay sheet at the horse's feet was against the rules.
This is against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that.”
One of my men accidentally pulled the mud on his foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have done it yesterday, and so did he.
It took the race day.
Moody's may face a three-month sentence due to the use of bars on racing day as a result of an investigation the managers have opened.
This is a joke.
Those who follow these rules do not know anything about horses.
“We understand that we need rules, but that’s going too far,” Moody said.
Driver who crashed in Cobram arrested
Police arrested a man who struck a bicycle car in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was removed from the air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the driver fled the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will not stop in an accident, not help, and be charged with other traffic crimes.
The 40-year-old cyclist remains stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to rival claims about fighting
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticism targeting his team as an effort to “build a day-to-day” for NRL’s two favourite primaries.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said on Friday night that the referees had allowed Storm to “do a battle” with his team in a match where he was hurt in the semi-finals in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett described the match as an "irritation" for the rugby league after a semi-final match won Saturday night against the North Queensland Cowboys and said the two Oueensland were not "very big" in the match.
Bellamy defended his team’s struggle and said they focused only on “contact” while fighting.
Bellamy said it was powered by criticisms coming to the team from two leading coaches because it meant they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
That’s going on – I’ve never heard Trent Robinson talk about fighting when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year, we’ve only put a real emphasis on our fighting contacts in the last six weeks, and that’s been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years, and obviously he has a huge team that he has mastered, and he is probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It’s funny that this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett’s idea of “exhilarating football,” reminding Bennett of his winning coach playing “dull” football for the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons primary.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
It was a matter of comparing our Friday night match with their own on Saturday night, and how exciting their match was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 that St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he’t even get a mouse ass.
But now we have a team to play what we can call exciting football, and especially the young half with their speeds.
This is the football you want to play when you have this type of players.
He put that point in 2010 and now everyone wants to play football in this style – every team has no half (twins) like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it’s not possible for them to play in this format.
This gives me more confidence because they even talk like that because they’re a little scared to play.
When they went to the big games six weeks ago, they probably didn’t bring us to mind.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Roosters match had higher scores than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our match is 20 - 18, but is this exciting football more than both sides scored in our match?
Or is it exciting to cut off attacks but not to do scoring attacks?
This is my day for me.
If they talk about us, it means that we will meet them here in a future phase.
Storm, the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks won no tickets this weekend because they won the right to host the first final match on Saturday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released with $200,000 fine for drug crimes
The man who was caught on 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland and faced a possible life imprisonment has been released on fine for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people who came from South America via Vanuatu and were arrested last month by the federal police for tracking a 100kg drug from the Solay yacht, which was landed in the port of Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen in a meeting with criminals in the marinade throughout the morning and then met with them in Coomera Roadhouse, where they found 40 kilograms of the drug inside a police Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility that he will face a potential death penalty for possessing commercial amounts of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer said there was no evidence that he himself was in an attempt to possess all the drugs and that he might be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan Maksimovic was concerned that there was a risk of escape.
They have connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied about where he was in the public case.
Maksimovic’s mother and father-in-law offered $200,000 for his release.
Judge Flanagan said, “It is clear that after reading both persons’ oath statements, the $200,000 penalty amounted to a real financial burden on them.”
But he warned that this wasn’t enough to stop him from going to the case.
Maksimovic was released in exchange for handing over his Australian and Serbian passports and complying with the ban on going to the police station every day and on the streets between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used girls’ phones to lure pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while asleep, logging in to an online messaging service and providing her with a series of inappropriate child images sent to her by another user.
The girl then woke up and realized she didn’t have a phone and found her phone in the hands of Hogg who was asleep.
He looked at her and immediately noticed the annoying messages before warning her mother.
Police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers found at the address and discovered "interested" web searches made using terms aimed at finding inappropriate children's pictures.
Hogg later claimed to officials that the reason he did this was to “manage pedophiles on the internet and behave and intimidate them like police.”
Financial advocate Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "It's a addiction - he said it's a addict that scares people.
He admitted that the searches were made by the computer, but said he did so to act like a police officer in order to intimidate pedophiles.
Questions were asked about interviews with the unknown person who sent him pictures and who wanted to send more pictures than them.
He said he did this to attract them.
He said he was caught up in sick thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she cried and called her mother and she was trembling and crying.
The mother saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and came after the accusations.
She was interviewed and said she used a computer and a PlayStation to look younger than the accused.
Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate children’s paintings on 14 June last year, violating the law on 25 January this year, and failing to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said Hogg was not included in the category of sexual offences because it could be disputed that there was no “definite sexual element” in the offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case until October when the social history study report will be given.
Hogg was released in this case, but he was detained for other unusual cases.
Sexual offences were recorded before the date of sentencing.
Robert Mugabe speaks wrong in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from the stairs on a podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but his video went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was stained with claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats if they were to slander him during Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
In his national appeal speech in parliament last month, they mocked him and repeatedly broke his promise — he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received messages to their mobile phones to avoid disturbing him during Mr Mugabe’s speech.
“After Mr. Mugabe’s speech ended, a message to journalists came from an unseen number but headed ‘Death’,” he said.
He tells members that their immunities are valid within parliament and that when they leave parliament, the immunity does not work.
The chief spokesman said the party, ruled by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "repressed" over threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to rebuild and cut costs in corporate services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating computer and printer from the company’s fast-growing hardware and service operations.
HP said in a statement that expected redundancies will result in a cost of around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will chair the post-division unit, said, “These reconstruction activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company.”
"Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio to help companies transition to a new business style," he said.
As a separate company, we are much better positioned than ever to meet the growing needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Company’s annual revenue will be more than $50 billion and will focus on “providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions for companies.”
Its garages in Palo Alto divide the company called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley" and founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment into two.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology firms, is one of the industry’s latest moves in the belief that firm-focused firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates have problems with Wilshere's injury before the Dinamo Zagreb match
Wenger stressed that Wilshere’s disability occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, and there was no reason for him not to play at Christmas.
The best scenario already means that Wilshere will definitely miss at least four matches in England, and it seems as uncertain as it looks when it comes to his past that he will take part in the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing part of the last problem is that Wilshere ended last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then searched for his former pre-season sharpness.
This type of disability is not a career threat, Wenger said.
This is an unhealed bone.
Not a big thing.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with your wrists or previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, this may be true, but as Wenger would accept, there is a risk that a player who returns in the middle of the season will get further injured.
There is also an uncomfortable development.
According to research conducted by Primary Injuries Ltd, Wilshere had 23 different disorders recorded since its inception six years ago.
He has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of two Premier League teams that have lost most of the time due to disability in six seasons since 2007-08.
Wenger acknowledges the potential for a downturn, but he believes Arsenal will continue to recover from last season’s disability record.
“Sometimes you’re going through a period of injury when you’re back from a disability, it’s a process you want to strengthen your body and win the fight,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust it, and I believe he will do the career he deserves.
There are matches between Chelsea, which will play in front of Arsenal on Saturday, which will start against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, and Tottenham Hotspur, which will play on Wednesday, Wenger is preparing the team for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, so it makes sense that he will play Arteta with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger could also start with Nacho Monreal and instead of Theo Walcott with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players the breath they need," Wenger said.
Despite being one of Arsenal’s open favourites in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb ranks among the most discouraged stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has not won 41 matches since producing its own "Namağlup" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This is the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the necessary lesson from last season's defeat against Monaco in the Champions League and continues to be motivated by the distant goal of bringing the club its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” says Wenger.
This has never happened in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I have enough experience to be realistic on the other hand.
We are passionate but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that teaches us serious lessons about men’s friendship
The absence of similar portals in programs is remarkable, especially at a time when men need more to open up and suicide rates among young men are at the peak of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the leading cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45; and it was three times more in men than in women.
To highlight this problem, the Campaign Against Ugly Living (CALM) has declared 2015 the Year of Men and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
There is friendship at the heart of the struggle to accomplish this challenging task.
A study among more than 2,000 high school students who showed depressive symptoms showed that people who suffer from this disorder had doubled their chances of recovery if they had a high number of “healthy-mode” friends.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the mental challenges that may arise.
But, of course, it has to be accessible to make friendship work first.
In this age where social media is focused on communication, focusing on style rather than content, makes urgent response more important than meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look like strong, fun-loving, and successful people, even if everything in reality is about isolation.
Under the domination of money, image, social status, concepts that psychologists call outward-driven values, artificial success is being wasted by inner values that have deeper implications for our mental health – our inner longing for personal development and friendship.
As a billionaire video game creator recently revealed, money doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned the focus down.
Characters were not defined by their work, but by their personalities; and they showed this through their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, minutes of watching football in comfortable chairs, and Ross’s relationship with Rachel all came from the knowledge that they could actually engage with them, even if they were back in plan to fully explain men’s feelings.
One helpful worker told me, “When I listened to people with depression and suicidal tendencies, I saw how even the slightest interaction between friends could make a difference.”
Most of the men who communicate with us cannot talk to their friends.
A feeling like “going past” is very strong, and the idea that opening up to others is also a sign of weakness.”
One of the programs I think of when suggesting long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He highlighted the small moments of his friendship.
According to my goal, a stranger status on the phone helps people in times of trouble; but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you’re joining the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are redesigned for celebration?
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don’t know what your friendship will do.
Friends, Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - released for #FriendsFest
Di Maria's goal made it easy for PSG to beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after the goal he scored for Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easy for PSG to overtake the goal the Swedish team scored for Malmö at the start of the Champions League on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and the match reactions.
In the match targeted by Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League match with a final comfortable and clear 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria was the PSG player who made it possible for the French champion to continue his way in the Champions League, but in the 61st minute they didn't appreciate the chances as much as Cavani's second goal.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the elite groups, but also to improve in the last three championship quarter-finals.
But the game they played while taking the points was not the best game of the period for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of position around the penalty field and was later taken aside against his hometown team, with whom he began his glorious career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League, whether inside or outside, but in this sense, winning 2-0 will create problems for our rivals, and even though there are some things we need to improve in the season, it’s a good start to give a comfortable picture behind,” Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
Even though I thought we didn’t score one or two more goals, we wanted to win and we won.
Ibrahimovic returned to Paris with one of the three-player changes in the 2-2 match against Bordeaux in the 1st League on the weekend, but remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing player was seen as the player who would take PSG to a higher level in Europe when he was transferred from Manchester United last month, and showed that such thinkers were not unfair as he ran behind the Malmö defender in Marco Veratti’s backstage and passed through the beautiful blow he sent Johan Wiland from the distant corner to the filets.
However, everyone was disappointed when they expected PSG to win a big victory.
In the play-off to go through this round, Malmö was rated to the field with nine international players who beat Celtic, with a five-man defense and two players in the midfield depth, a heavy rival.
In the 34th minute, they made very few attacks except for Nikola Djurdjic's shutdown of the pillar of the corner that Kevin Trapp protected.
PSG, on the other hand, gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient final strikes, in the first half Ibrahimovic failed to make the finishing move in at least five attacks, and at the start of the second half disappointed Cavani's failure to keep up with the game.
However, when it came to organizing his colleagues, he showed that he was more masterful, it was Ibrahimovic who in the 52nd minute gave the trick of the false blow that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came thanks to Cavani after a full hour of filling, the Uruguayan player scored his sixth goal in the season with the head that Maxwell revealed from his left wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
The ideas that Malmö would return to the match were exhausted and after the untold goal that later entered the game by Ezequiel Lavezzi, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz’s shake in the empty position and did not allow the score to change.
Then Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class superior to his own team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played ball in the Swedish League that hasn’t been on the same level as him.
Teams are not enough.
Hats in Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion in sales of shares
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore struck a blow from falling processed commodity prices and earned $2.5 billion by selling its shares on Wednesday as part of its debt-sharing plan.
London-listed Glencore has announced that it has sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, was severely affected by falling commodity prices as China’s economic slowdown caused demand to rise and market confusion.
The right issue caused Glencore’s stock prices to rise at the London Stock Exchange early on Wednesday morning.
The shares jumped 0.69 percent higher on the FTSE 100 index, up 2.77 percent to 131.60.
Glencore announced a $2.5 billion share sale plan last week as part of a plan to cut its $30 billion debt pack by a third.
The company sold its new shares at 125 pennies per share, a discount of 2.4 percent from Tuesday’s closing.
It sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Worries about China’s long-standing growth cut iron ore prices by roughly half, while coal, copper and other commodities dropped between 20 and 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The visit, Xi’s first official visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
Following the bilateral talks between the two presidents, U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner in honour of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
“President Xi’s visit will expand U.S.-China cooperation on regional and global issues, and will enable President Obama and President Xi to constructively address disputed issues,” the statement said.
Xi’s first visit, announced in February, is expected to go to Seattle before Washington, where he will meet with some U.S. technology leaders, followed by a trip to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address Washington’s concerns about allegations that China is conducting cyber espionage activities, among others, and some controversial issues involving China’s claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon shows diversity in filmmaking as insignificant
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it was not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate of interest in diversity.
In the Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, released on HBO, the experienced actor cut off his promise, emphasizing that there should be alternative perspectives on the black main character in the chosen script of the project.
Damon argued that when we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the show, not in the cast of the film.
Shocked, Brown reacted that the actor's comments on the Martian film continued with statements like "Hey!
The finalists of the Damon and Brown show were discussed by co-producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers.
Brown said earlier, “I wanted to think about how people – regardless of who the director is – would behave to the character of Harmony.”
A single black character is a prostitute shot by a white conversational wire.
The publisher of Dear White People, who insisted on the rights to direct the film, asked the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio.
After the debate was published, there was an outbreak of dissatisfaction on social media over Damon's comments.
MrPooni, a Twitter user, wrote: “Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room and can explain his diversity about this person as being hurt by WHITE JESUS.”
The tweet received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments came at a time when correct racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debates.
After being murdered by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Life Matters movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials across the country to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince spoke of the move in a top-down manner as the Album of the Year nominations were announced at the Grammy Awards.
The albums are important.
Albums like books and black lives are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Life Is Important movement issued a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent figure on Fox News, whether or not the group should be regarded as a hate group.
The leaders said Black Life Matters Network is a love group.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show artists, producers, and media bosses who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he accepted the invitation or did not meet with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior wins first championship
Professional rock climber and funny Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win a $1 million prize on Monday night, winning the American Ninja Warrior program.
This competition, which entered the seventh season, had never seen a competitor who could complete all the stages on the obstacle track before.
In the final of the season, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to stay in the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first athlete to complete the course in time, thus becoming the first athlete to complete the challenging fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won by finishing the course three seconds before him.
After this tough victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News with a shock of having won the $1 million big prize.
Isaac told E! about a huge increase in his salary, “I think it’s amazing even to think about it, I’ve never earned or spent more than $10,000 a year.”
So it happened in a moment...I can’t even imagine what it will be...the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and explained why Britten would not be awarded any awards, though he was the first to finish the track.
According to the rules, money is paid the fastest.
Weed said, “If you finish more than one, you win the prize for the fastest.”
While money is a great prize and life changes, he also won a huge bonus.
I don’t think he has a bad idea about it.
He is happy for what he has done.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family father.
He is a hero for his wife and children.
Geoff said to me, “If someone defeats me, I’m glad it’s Isaac.”
I think if the roles had changed, Isaac would have thought the same.
American Ninja Warrior has renewed its contract for the eighth season and shootings will begin in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers vs Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season was not very pleasant for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, once the best in baseball, are now in the final of the American Central League.
Reducing their game to disastrousness, the Tigers managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday, making an excellent game.
The Twins lost their chance to rise to the Second League wild card by exceeding the half-point difference between the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, even for one night, it was a return to a very good game for most of the second half of the season.
As Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said, “Whatever the way, all victories are joyful.”
Tigers shooter Alfredo Simon managed to score one in the sixth and ninth shots, showing early attack support as Detroit scored three times in the first two shots.
Simon (13-9) scored six 3/1 shots in a row, three of which were running.
This was only the third quality start in the last nine rounds.
“I just want to close the year strongly,” said Simon.
It’s hard to waste every game for the backup, so I wanted to dive deeper into the game.
Tigers’ selected shooter Victor Martinez scored three shots and two were running, which was the first RBI he had won since mid-August.
This was the first of three striking nights on this side of the four hits that Martinez won against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He shrugged the blade tightly,” Ausmus said.
It looked good (in combat training), it was already more visible in BP, which continued in the game.
At the end of the seventh strike, the Twins had the best chance to get back into the game.
Middle-field player Byron Buxton started the shooting line by doubling on the left field line.
Right-wing player Aaron Hicks was only able to make a slow hit, and Simon caught his second goalkeeper, BrianDozier, to make a hit while jumping before lifting for the left BlaineHardy.
Mauer, the only player who could boldly advance against the striker Miguel Sano who passed right-wing player Drew VerHagen in the two-running run.
With a pair of runners in the second connecting race, VerHagen managed to draw the third goalkeeper Trevor Plouffe into a double game.
Plouffe’s strike against DP was the 27th time in the Premier League this season.
After struggling for a run that would guarantee Detroit's ninth place, Mauer surpassed the RBI and interrupted with the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon by a 5-4 score.
However, he was caught to Sano in three shots for the fifth-fifth rescue.
Detroit took advantage with Phil Hughes' early departure.
The Tiger have won three races in their first two shots against an experienced right-wing player who has been away from the fields for more than a month due to a backburn and has just emerged from a disability.
“Obviously, this isn’t the game I want to play,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable and I managed to make pretty good shots in the third shot.”
After a successful first shot, Hushes removed his second goalkeeper, Ian Kinsler.
The right-wing player J.D. Martinez’s two-time out of play left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to cross the 0-21 band in the numbering position.
The third goalkeeper, Nick Castellanos, followed with one shot to the right, won another run but Victor Martinez was thrown as he wanted to do the third, so the threats were over.
The Tiger added in the second, with a pair out of captain James McCann and a two-out from midfield player Anthony Gose winning the position 3-0.
Twin manager Paul Molitor said it was “a big blow.”
He didn’t hit well, but he hit the right place.
Hughes, who counted the shots, fifty-righted three shots until he was replaced by A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs and four scoring shots in six strikes.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of play due to pain in the shoulder he used to throw.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez’s shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries due to shoulder pain since mid-August, was scheduled to start working on Wednesday.
In Sanchez’s absence, LHP will face the Twins with Daniel Norris DL.
Norris and Tiger have been in a 1-1 position in four matches since David Price's transfer on July 30.
He hasn't played since August 20 due to pain on his right side.
Tiger and Twin will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will compete against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group in charge of leading the reforms that the economy needs to be more open to the outside in order to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Central Leading Group Meeting to Strengthen General Reforms, the President said, “China should develop its opening policies by attracting foreign investment expertise.”
Xi said that while promoting openness, making new reforms will create a new space for economic growth, bringing new energy and vitality.
The leadership group adopted a series of recommendations such as a negative list that regulates market access, easing border control policies, encouraging state-owned organizations (SOEs) to add private capital, and a review of the system of registration of settlements.
According to the explanation, a negative list of prohibited sectors and business branches for investment will be prepared.
The system will be tested phase by phase and enhanced with trial programs.
This is an important move because it will play a greater role in allocating resources to the market and will make the market more transparent by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen its controls over companies, allowing companies to do their own business.
China will also explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation in its border regions and activate new mechanisms to boost regional growth.
More areas will be opened for private investment to open sectors controlled by the state.
The statement said: “The government will not change its foreign investment policy, and will provide them with better services by protecting the interests of foreign-funded companies.”
In addition, foreigners will be able to obtain permanent residence permits or “green card” by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practice and the training of professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at the meeting.
A statement released after the meeting said Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting.
Miniature bag now very fashionable-time newspaper Friday packaging
In the fashion world, the roads turn around and come to the bags.
The most recent ones are those that have been mining.
It is also possible to say that the small bags attached to the adults are also attracting attention.
Everything is said to be small.
This also applies to suitcases.
When he was almost unable to walk through the streets with suitcases in the size of the suitcase, the wind suddenly began to blow in the opposite direction and the bags began to shrink.
There were small bags already, but this time they met us with the smaller handbags of the big handbags.
These tiny bags can only fit your phone, credit card and key.
The current started with Céline and Hermès, spread with Prada.
The admiration of the bag became a miniature curiosity also influenced the newly emerging models.
Loewe presented the fun suitcases he prepared this season in two sizes.
Panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags are the most elephant-looking ones.
The mini sizes of large bags offered by luxury brands with phenomenal names seem to have attracted the most red carpet celebrities once again.
Hermes’ “Birkin” suitcase for Jane Birkin is one of the most popular.
Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn’t want her name to be mentioned in a bag, but that’s how it’s in her memories.
The fashion week has made the mini bag flow massive.
There are also mini-bags in front of them.
It is not possible to put them on your arm because they are so small.
They can be used with long crosses.
But on the podiums we saw those long suspensions wrapped in the wrists of models more.
Fendi is one of those who carries the mini bag position to a forward point.
There is a suggestion for those who can’t fit in a mini bag but can’t give up on them.
Small baggage with big bags.
How is it?
Converting mini bags into a bag that can be attached to the big ones.
This presentation on the podiums has quickly found its reward on the street.
Let’s see what else we will see!
Changes in skin
Turkey is competing with the world’s brands in denim.
This experience he has gained in production is now enriched by design.
Loft is one of them.
We see a few black models that have been used before now take their place on the shelves every season.
During the season when the blacks were so high, the Denim found their closest friend.
Leather pieces and detailed leather designs stand out as the best friend of denim.
Generally speaking, short-sized models called "motorcycles" are in the day.
The strong atmosphere of the skin is complemented by black pieces again; long sweaters, shiny sweaters give a stylish appearance.
Young people used to wear denim and wanted to disappear in the crowd.
I thought it would save the day.
Now young people want to carry on a piece that emphasizes as comfortably as they can.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft has properly understood the target audience with the collections and complementary pieces it has created.
A small, big step for Banksy
The world premiere of the "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, took place in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which is the product of the artist's 15 years of work and the first exhibition of the Global Works Building, where 85 original works come together for the first time.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul opened the day before at Global Karaköy (Rihtim Street).
The world famous artist who hid his identity and used the mysterious name, of course, was not at the opening.
I don’t know if you’re coming to Istanbul.
But according to exhibition curator Steve Lazaridas, Bansky is not even aware of the exhibition.
There is no need for permission from him.
Bansky and Lazaridas, a former friend, are separated after 12 years.
Some of the exhibited works were collected by Lazaridas and some by collectors.
But there are things that Bansky’s followers are interested in.
What would Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", which brings together 85 works?
For example, how would he pay for entering the exhibition with a ticket (35 TL)? what would he say if he saw the small store created at the end of the 800 square meter gallery area?
The Girl with the Red Balloon, the Cleaner, the Rose Now would make noise that the works that draw attention to the world’s wounding topics are printed on bags, wallets, necklaces?
Making the exhibition of an anarchist-spirited artist who hides his identity such a consumer material is a disappointment for Banksy’s followers.
It’s not Banksy’s style.
Get your tickets before a limited number is exhausted.
The big exhibition "The Art of Banksy" for Banksy's small, globalized world can be seen until April.
They are humble and cruel.
Those who go dig up.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continued to react to the academics who signed the statement.
Erdogan said, “These are cruel, these are humble.”
Those who are with the wrongdoers are the wrongdoers.
“They have committed the same crime because they were with the murderers.”
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who left the carnage in the place of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "In this action on the Sultanahmet Square, a fairly peaceful square that smells of history and civilization - especially near the German Crescent - in such a region that 10 of our German friends died, I shared our sadness with the German President and the German Chancellor.
I would like to extend my heartfelt wishes to all the German people, first and foremost to the families of those who died."
“Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination.”
Erdogan, who continued to react to the academicians who signed the statement, said: "I especially reiterate, I severely condemn the academics who have stood up in the face of all these terrorist incidents and issued a blatant statement and signed under those massacres."
The fact that our people understand who they are so much closer, that is, that the professor, the docent, is in front of them, does not make anyone clear.
These are dark people.
These are wicked and they are wicked.
They have committed the same crimes as the murderers.
This is where the puppies in the case of the Chinatown, the three-year-old Mevlüde, who is a witch with his father, will be placed by these dark academics?
How do they take place with their murderers?
I call on all the judicial authorities, the senates of the universities to take office because of these actions contrary to our Constitution and laws.
I said yesterday that the steps to be taken should be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, they go there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can’t do it in parliament, they should either go crawl or climb into the mountains.
I speak so clearly and clearly.

Farewell to the Last Journey
Celine Dion has lost her wife.
Canadian singer Celine Dion’s wife, René Angélil, has died.
Angélil discovered Dion’s talent when she was 12, and the pair married in Montreal in 1994.
Celine Dion stopped her career in 1999 after she was diagnosed with cancer.
I found 26 people searching for two wrestling kids.
The second documentary of Mete Gümürhan, “Young Pehlivan”, 66.
It was the first Turkish documentary selected for the Berlin Film Festival (February 11-21) in the "Generation Lplus" section.
Gümürhan, which is originally Edirneli but has a manufacturing company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he drew the documentary he completed his shootings in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans", which tells the story of a six-year-old school student from Amasya who aims to become a world champion in competition, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivan, the first Turkish documentary to be selected for this category, is one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear Award.
Although he was born as a Dutchman, he was originally an established director of Met Gümürhan.
When he came to Turkey during the summer holidays as a child, he listened to stories from his grandfather and watched the competitions.
“There are no political problems in Turkey.
I wanted to tell the world what else was happening in Anatolia.
"For example, the horse racing of our sports is unfortunately very unknown," he said, with the idea of meeting with six directors and preparing a documentary project.
This project remains unsuccessful, but one day the magazine news he read on the plane opens the door to another project for Gümürhan.
In the sugar factory.
Mete Gümürhan, a 10-11 year old wrestler who follows the story of two younger brothers, goes to Samsun where his family lives.
The parents of the children do not allow filming for documentary.
The Customsman explains how he overcame this difficulty: “I thought about what I could do all day long.
The support from the Ministry of Culture could have been withdrawn.”
At the meeting, the father talked about a lodge school in Amasya where the children would go.
I thought to go there.
I met 26 kids who were interested in fighting at school while looking for two kids.
We started shooting in a week and finished permits.
We had no place to stay.
We stayed in the bedroom of the sugar factory.
It was the most difficult language the documentary completed in three weeks brought out to the director.
Gümürhan, the foreign image director and speaker with whom he worked, said that three different languages were spoken, "I didn't know what I would encounter when shooting."
“They didn’t know Turkey.”
Young Pehlivans focuses on the story of six of the 26 children’s fighters.
Baran, raised by his grandfather and suffering from weight problems, Harun, who can’t attend training because of his broken arm, Beytullah, who is ambitious but has health problems, the school’s adorable boy Ümit, the youngest champion Ahmet and the group holding together...
Met Gümürhan tells her about working with children: “I left them completely natural.”
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I did the first and a half weeks of training.
I want kids to act like they don’t have a camera.
“They got used to it quickly.”
It was a surprise to visit Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan, who said that young Pehlivans did not expect to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival, said: "We had an appeal, but it was a surprise that we were selected for Berlin."
Young Pehlivans is not a sports documentary, but a production that tells the children's struggles and brings the cuts from their lives.
“I wanted to highlight the stories of children with family problems who were able to cope with their identity efforts and problems.”
Supporting academics from the art world
After the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative", the storm that broke out yesterday went to investigate and detain academics, and on the one hand, followed by support statements.
The first support came from many famous authors among them.
Earlier this week, the filmmakers announced their support.
In a statement signed by the 138 theaters, “We stand by this honourable meeting of the Academics who are called for peace as artists working in the field of theatre and stage-art, and declare that we stand by freedom of expression, equality, the right to life and unconditional peace.”
“We share our voice with all our faith and with all our hearts to the academics’ call for negotiation and peace.”
Among them are Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbac, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Slavli, Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik, and more than 400 filmmakers.
But if it is not without it, it is without it: "We will not be associates to this crime!"
Academics for Peace was supported by the Academics for Peace Initiative.
The Association of Film Writers (SYAD) said in a statement, “We are with academics who have become the target of the Linç campaign.”
The Academic Initiative for Peace called on the government to peace and negotiate with simultaneous statements in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January, and issued a statement entitled "We are not associates in this crime".
The text was signed by 1128 academics at 89 universities, as well as world-renowned thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, and Etienne Balibar.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoglu have severely criticized the academics’ report as “support to terrorism,” and called on the institutions to “do their duty.”
After this call, while some universities terminated the academics’ work, the prosecutor’s office launched a serious investigation.
Many academics were arrested.
My fan, please help me!
Hürrem Sultan’s red hair, Beren’s nose, Justin’s hair...
While trying to look like a celebrity is as normal as somewhere, it is seen as a psychological disorder after it begins to affect life as a whole.
Celebrity worship syndrome, also known as the other "scientific worship syndrome", has become an academic topic in the world, and we have recently talked about it.
It can be considered as normal to run to the hairdressing halls with famous photographs of ladies.
But let’s not forget the “Hürrem Sultan” year when all the teens traveled in Ireland with red hair.
In the 2015 aesthetic surgery we left behind, Beren’s nose has already been pulled.
The situation is not very different on the front.
For a long time, he was dressed like a German.
Now, the opposite wind is blowing.
Justin Bieber is full of copies.
So much so that the unnecessary information we quoted has been read thousands of times on the Internet: "When you go to the barber, first of all, cut the side of your hair, that is, the top of your ears and the surrounding area to the top of your head."
The sides will be short.
After the cutting process, you should shape your hair with light water.
After finishing the process, fix your hair with the help of a spray.
"Justin needs to shape when moist to get hair."
All this, which has already become an academic topic in the world, brings to mind the newly spoken 'Celebrity worship syndrome', the name of the other 'glorious worship syndrome'.
The fans of celebrities are seen in us as lovers.
The artists are proud of their admiring numbers, how much they have influenced them.
Fortunately, psychology is not so simple.
In particular, it is disputed that teenagers decide according to celebrities what to eat and drink, what to listen to and what to wear.
Excessive devotion to unattainably-presented names, role modeling is defined as mental disorder.
Specialist psychologist Sümeyye Iron admits that Turkey is lagging behind in this field of work.
But he does not ignore the gradual awareness of families: "One of the fundamental issues of psychological science is that a person is at peace with himself, that he is at peace with his own identity."
At first, filling the children’s room with posters would not be taken too seriously to hang onto someone’s coat.
Now that is changing.
He feels the need for his parents to intervene.
"Passionate devotion to someone is a sign that something is going wrong in a young person's life."
Fans of Emotional Speed Train
Interest in celebrities is not dangerous, as long as it is not excessive.
He suggests that you avoid signs such as not wanting to marry him, jealous of his spouse, preferring his clothes.
We are talking about famous people.
Being interested in them is as normal as being involved with their lives somewhere.
But the young people who missed the tip of the expert psychologist most often say: "When there are no names to represent the child in virtue, good behavior in the family or in the environment, that void must be filled."
There are not always good examples.
“He also copies the negatives.”
When we consult how to approach them, Sumeye Iron begins his speech by reminding us that the passion syndrome of fame is seen more in adolescence.
If you consider that adolescents can be insecure, the problem becomes more comfortable.
On the one hand, we are faced with youths who wait for support and compassion while complaining about the limitations of their families: “We have to consider their emotional downturns.”
New research has shown that they are challenged by changes that occur in their brains.
"The attachment of pride to a young man on an emotional speed train should also be naturally welcomed, gently approached."
Behavior can be changed
Expert psychologist Sümeyye Iron reminds of the tasks that fall on parents to overcome the fame worship syndrome:
Recognize his emotional distress, make sure you’re calm before you get into the matter.
Never let him suppress your feelings.
Indicate that you respect her admiration to promote independence.
Instead of teaching by slandering, show a good example, discuss names that will be role models for him.
Try to take the place of celebrities in our daily lives together.
It will be useful to read books that tell the real world of celebrities together.
Transform your communication into an adult form.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept them as they are.
Seek expert support in the field.
Those who are angry and angry admire them.
On the basis of the glorious worship syndrome, someone else needs to receive medet umma and help.
Love that cannot be stopped is actually a call for help.
Unfortunately, it is not perceived like that.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu points out that there are certain names that are engaged in television in every country.
The syndrome manifests itself more by attaching to these celebrities: “They are extraordinary.”
The majority do not have their capabilities.
Those who have, do not behave like them.
Whether they don’t accept or dare.
"But those who do not have the possibility do not have the possibility and continue to look with a nerve that does not live like them."
Those who are nervous or nervous don’t really matter.
Both are deeply admired.
They earn money effortlessly, they’re on the magazine’s daylight.
Even knowing this is enough to increase the fancy.
Another advice from expert Psychologist Sümeyye Iron is to question the reality of those lives precisely at this point.
It is not to be overlooked that artistic lives are concerned.
The support of the person who is passionate about celebrity enters here.
But he admits that the person who is famous has problems like himself.

Should I have a surgery? - Family - Health News - Time Journal
Dr. Fevzi Özgönül answers questions in the corner of the Challenge newspaper.
I have stones in my gallbladder, and when I get up every morning, I go to the toilet 2 or more times a day with stomach pain after meals.
Could this prevent me from losing weight?
I started using alkaline right now, but my desire to eat is not decreasing, I can’t lose weight at all.
That’s since my childhood.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have surgery?
Answer: The gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
The pain of the stomach that develops immediately after the meal is also a sign that when you eat it, the gallbladder is compressed and the inflammatory spleen is empty into the intestines.
The intestines that are disturbed due to the inflamed bile are quickly trying to throw out this circuit.
This is why you often go to the bathroom.
Because you often go to the toilet, what you eat is thrown away without digestion and your weight loss is slow.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a specialist gastroenterologist and the situation I said is detected, you can get rid of this situation using antibiotics.
At the end of the day, you may also need to undergo surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can reduce these complaints a bit, but it won’t pass.
No matter what, continue to use probiotics.
Because the biggest aid for your weight loss is this probiotic powder.
I eat too much when I am stressed.
When I am stressed and nervous, I eat and gain weight.
How can I deal with it?
Answer: Excessive appetite means that energy needs are not fully met.
This may be due to eating less or skipping morning and lunch meals.
Another reason is that you cannot digest the foods you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you do not have ulcers, reflux, or similar problems, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic medication.
You will see a lot of benefits.
I don't get weight, doctors don't know the reason
You usually have information about weakening in your corner.
It sounds logical to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can’t get any pounds.
Most importantly, I don’t know why.
The doctors said nothing.
Answer: The techniques we use are not only aimed at losing weight, but also to restore the physiological function of the body to its ideal dimensions.
Weakness is the same disorder as obesity.
Not losing weight with obesity is treated with the same technique.
When you eat sweet and fried foods, you get weaker.
I think you’ve understood it so far.
You can also be stimulated with carboxipunktura and lose weight with healthy eating.
This means that you are weakening away from your ideal body.
Our other patients also moved away from their ideal bodies by fattening.
You will reach your ideal body by losing weight, and they will also reach by losing weight.
If the system problem disappears, you will lose weight, and they will also lose weight.
First of all, the system needs to work properly.

A child who feels worthless.
Some feelings are born in the human world.
Fear, sadness, happiness, astonishment, anger, worry...
But feelings such as hatred, anger, vengeance arise in children over time and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Everyone needs to be a person, including childhood.
That is to say, he respects the decisions of his parents or the social environment, wants to be asked about the issues that interest him and feel valuable.
This is the basis for building a healthy personality.
Behavior such as deciding instead of the child (what to wear, what to eat) in matters that concern the child, not caring for the child's wishes, and instead directing his or her own truths (sending the child who wants to go to a football course) means not respecting the child's personality.
As a child who does not respect his or her self and existence loses the freedom to be himself, his or her defense mechanism develops a sense of anger and hatred to protect him or her.
"Because in fact anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance," says the psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child doesn't accept what has been done to him by hating him, and he tries to tell him and his surroundings that he is valuable.
The expert psychologist noted that the child’s refusal to accept the situation and react in this way is a positive development in terms of his personality development, “Hate here means ‘I also exist’ serves the purpose of preserving the child’s respect for himself.”
“If a child is allowed to be an individual, hatred disappears.”
The child tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred.
At a young age, in the most vulnerable times of both body and spirit, the parents of children, Arslan, who says that being exposed to verbal and emotional violence by their surroundings can cause negative emotions in the child, stresses that neglect and neglect will give the child the feeling that his presence is not noticed, that he is invisible.
Arslan continues: “It can sometimes be in the form of not being satisfied in the emotional sense of their needs (not shaking their hair, hugging and kissing, not taking care of school or other needs), and sometimes their physical needs (eating, drinking, shelter, school needs, etc.) are not satisfied.”
This is an attitude of growing up which opens the door to hatred.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are behaviors such as humiliation, insult, contempt, humiliation, giving unnecessary and heavy punishments, feeling worthless, screaming.
These behaviors are deeply affecting the child’s personality.
“The child either loses his self-respect by accepting them and spends his life struggling with the feeling of being worthless, unworthy of being loved and inadequate, or he tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred.”

Attacks on journalists have become commonplace in Turkey
Before Prime Minister Davutoglu’s visit to London next week, 25 famous writers sent a joint signature letter to British Prime Minister Cameron to Turkey.
The PEN member writers asked Cameron in his meeting with Davutoglu to bring about the recession in press and freedom of expression in Turkey.
Britain’s leading authors have sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron asking him to bring back the backdrop in Turkey’s press and expression freedom issues during his London visit next week.
25 authors, including the presidents of the International Union of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, expressed serious concerns about the “unprecedented pressure on freedom of expression in Turkey.”
The authors, who pointed out that threats and physical attacks on journalists, writers and publishers are now becoming commonplace, mentioned as an example the attacks on the offices of the Hürriyet Journals, the domination of the Koza Silk Media Group and the imposition of hands on them.
Among them are famous British writers such as Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith and Ian Rankin, as well as PEN member writers including Elif Shafak, in a letter that three journalists working for the Vice News agency were arrested, other journalists were prosecuted and journalists were continued to be arrested.
The authors, who stated that the arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül during the investigation phase in the MIT TIRs case also caused concerns, said: "It is of vital importance that journalists in Turkey allow them to fulfill their original duties in society, limit the public and inform them without being censored."
Attacks on journalists, writers and publishers undermine the freedoms of the entire Turkish society.
Because of the widespread “culture of inviolability”, journalists and writers are exposed to abusive methods ranging from physical assault to sexual assault.
The authors noted that the number of Turkish citizens who have been sued for “insulting the president” has increased, and that Erdogan, after being elected in 2014, has opened more insult cases than all of his supporters combined.
The words of Davutoglu remain.
While it is drawn that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, who will visit London next week, is one of the few members of the government who expressed support for press freedom, it is stated that these statements did not turn into action.
“Therefore, Davutoglu’s visit to London represents an important opportunity in terms of making a clear commitment to freedom of expression in Turkey.”
The authors asked Cameron to call on Prime Minister Davutoglu to ensure that his government respects Turkey’s obligations in terms of freedom of expression.
25 authors signed the letter:
Monica Ali, Alan Bissett, William Boyd, Chris Brookmyre, Gillian Clarke, Drew Campbell (President of PEN Scotland), Fflur Dafydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Elfyn (President of PEN Wales), Moris Farhi, Maureen Freely (President of PEN UK), Richard Gwyn, Mark Haddon, David Hare, Eva Hoffman, Hari Kunzru, Robert Minhinnick, Blake Morrison, Neel Mukherjee, Ian Rankin, Elif Shaafak, Owen Sheers, Ali Smith, Tom Stoppard, Sarah Waters.
Clashes in Cizre jumped into all neighborhoods, 2 children were killed in the courtyard of the house
The ban on the streets announced in the district of Zizre from 14 December continues.
Since the first day of the ban, no weapons and explosions have been heard.
During periods of severe conflict, people are leaving the area.
An explosion struck a house in a mountainous neighborhood, killing two children aged 11 and 12.
In Zizre, the ban on the streets was also abandoned on the 33rd day.
Conflicts between the security forces and the PKK have left citizens in a difficult situation.
In the remaining 33 days, citizens living in the Nur, Cudi, Sur and Yafes neighborhoods where the landslides were found have left the neighborhoods while they have not been able to provide electricity and water for 33 days.
They had to migrate to areas where there were no barricades and barricades because of the conflicts that occurred in the people who lived here.
While some citizens left the district with a white flag attached to the car, those who did not have the car, took the things they could carry with them and moved to the surrounding provinces and districts.
Especially in the neighborhoods where barricades and barricades were in conflict, citizens moved to more central neighborhoods.
But recently, because of the conflicts in these neighborhoods, citizens have also had to move from here.
In the mountain neighborhood of these neighborhoods, the uncle's children who hit their bodies after the explosion hit the door while in the courtyard of their house, the 12 year old Yusuf Akalın and the 11 year old Büşra Akalın lost their lives.
In an area with a high population density in the Shah District, three people were injured in an explosion thrown into a building.
Because of the ban passed a bear, most citizens needed cash.
In the district where all banks and ATMs were closed, citizens had to use their credit cards.
People who do not have a credit card are in trouble.
The majority of people who cannot afford food and medicines have emigrated.
Those who remain in the province can survive with the help of relatives and the benefactors of Zizreli.
There is no medical intervention for those suffering from tooth pain in the area where only emergencies can go to the hospital.
Since the start of the large operation on 14 December, the schools are not being taught in the district where they are closed.
Students who will take the Open Teaching College (AÖF) exam on 16 and 17 January will not be able to enter the exam.
The Ministry of National Education announced that the exams of students in the districts of Silopi and Cizre will be held in Mardin.
However, students who did not want to go because they still did not want to go out on the streets in the districts, there were no vehicles to go to Mardin, and entrances to the districts were forbidden, could not take the exam.
