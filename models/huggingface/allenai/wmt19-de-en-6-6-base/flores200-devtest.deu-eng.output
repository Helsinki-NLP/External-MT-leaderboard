This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had springs, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot deliver, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the top and light or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur springs do not possess a well-developed shaft called Rachis, but possess other characteristics of feathers - barbules and barbules - the researchers concluded that the Rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for showing. Researchers suspected that the sample, although the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult, not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and no chick down.

Her other race, the giant slalom, ended with 10th place in the women ’ s group with a combined running time of 4: 41.30. She was 2: 11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1: 09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers of the Krückenskifahrens did not come to the finish, and 45 of the total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone again.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and ensured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused had appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car was racing in, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, incurred considerable injuries on his head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services liberated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murder of her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but testimony from eyewitnesses may be distorted, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous border if you publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until the indictment.
According to the Leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand that the borders be reset before the 1967 war.
Other issues that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the accompanying attempt to curb the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association ’ s hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, said the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were given comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Yesterday Martelly sworn in a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martellys fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission responded to the widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the failure to conduct elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering from slight burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents of overheating that the company called" not serious "."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "really regrettable".
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07: 19 local time (21: 19 GMT on Friday).
The Civil Protection Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also explained that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early on, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturity of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government recovered two "Black Box" pamphlets on Wednesday.
Ringer's colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said," "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman". ""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even more crazy... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the share of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
During the election campaign for the federal election in 2010, temporarily acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II ’ s reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29% of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at Olympic games was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the disciplines 100 m and 200 m freestyle as well as in three layers, but his fitness was doubted because of his many complaints.
He was unable to take the drugs needed to overcome his pain, as they were forbidden at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water supply to the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists promise to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, emerge.
Cuomo (53) joined his Board earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
He is speculated that he could apply for the post of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and each year save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional means of transport and the above ground trains will not stop in Wembley. On-site there will be no parking spaces or parking facilities available.
Concerning lack of transport possibilities, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within only two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process lasted much longer due to the mating between a native Darwinfinch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to a thin wire that can be turned and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. One can produce an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its colour, depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been extracted from their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them with clean, wet hands to a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Remains of wastewater systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses visited by men and women in mixed society.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was transported from a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our gaze somewhat.
A gigantic missile with a height of more than 100 feet is required to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest service the wheel has rendered to us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railways, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are cats of medium size, which eat prey animals of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including freely roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task that each cat has and which ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act similarly to wolf or dog noodles, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in behavior and are just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump large distances and pull with the five-fold power of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (type Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of crispy crippled words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they exploit monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ozelot chases are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that Ozelote traces and traces animals to eat (prey) with their sense of smell. They sniff where they have rested on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their loot by visually aligning themselves with their surroundings and then fall on their loot.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. when they move over a mountain chain or a river or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population needs other features or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it used before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
With time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, breathe in humans, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun through photosynthesis. They also donate shadows.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothing from plants. We mainly feed on plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurians.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another sentence on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal crossing his way.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other Mosasaurians, and was perhaps even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a big dinosaur like the T. Rex had not grown up.
While the majority of their food should be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs. On the other hand, the rich men rather held common banquets where they lay on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Rome dishes could not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither maize, tomatoes, potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple that was considered the house of God.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried by ceremonies and feasts to correspond to the will of the gods.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shops open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished for murder from Iceland. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave him the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo ’ s tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between people, kings, customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "The Legacy of the Templar Knights", you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written.
Nobody knows with certainty who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29 ¾ inches x 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of his life.
So it is possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the ensuing battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was dominated by the" Vichy "French. These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
After only two weeks the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states, based on the federal treaty, formed a weak central government that consisted only of Congress.
Congress was not authorised to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, in enforcing all its laws, it relied on the authorities of states that often did not cooperate.
He also had no power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the world ’ s most successful football team and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, rollerhockey and Formula 1 motor sports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster / group of islands Japan has been called" archipelago "" geographically often. "
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by there and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East Indies established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the grain cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644 – 1912) took control of Taiwan ’ s western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki after its defeat in the First Chinese War (1894 – 1895), in which it ceded the sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu ’ s restoration work lasted until 1976.
For example, the world ’ s most widely used 35 mm still image format, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analog film mära.
It is still manufactured today, but it is even more important that its image format has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3: 2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-reviled and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism while preserving a degree of order in an image.
It says that the intersection point of the lines, which third a picture vertically and horizontally, is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the churches' money is precisely for this reason.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was complied with.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective because it cut the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated the generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating into entire sea sections, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U Boot warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities in the First World War, nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book with poems and a letter of recommendation by Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of displaying different ages. Every period of time in China and every family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties there were also periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
In these times fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a turning away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also after the revolution all occupations were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could recite.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class membership, the army ’ s leaderboards were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) in order to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively image of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
One sees nothing except the clear, beautiful sky above it and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave very little can be seen or heard from this world.
The Cheopspyramide is the only of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many great pyramid structures built for the veneration of deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza plateau or "Giza's necropolis" in the Egyptian valley of the dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "swab" symbol looks like a bracket or square where the bottom line is missing.
Up means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means that you start with the frog (that is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The removal usually generates a softer sound, while the removal is stronger and more expressive.
You can add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed arc markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
King Louis the XIV, Queen Marie the Antoinette, panic, her two little children (the 11-year-old Marie the Therese and the 4-year-old Louis the Charles) as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 in Versailles by a mob from market women.
They traveled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who launched threats against the king and the queen.
The Mob forced King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the appalled queen.
The war editions of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were carried by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of expenditure, and interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street ’ s banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people constituted the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The epoch during which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an age in European history stretching over the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 AD 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which end in agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general notions. On the one hand, the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are inherently rather than socially conditioned.
One can say, for example, that the passenger car inevitably involves the development of roads.
However, a country-wide road network for only a small number of cars is economically unviable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
The widespread automobile ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new health techniques for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong cultural deterministic element, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures arose related to this geography and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of today ’ s world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicentre of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status decreased in the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world migrated from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning the clothes were strongly influenced by the culture Byzantium 'in the east.
However, the styles in the West depend 25 to 30 years later due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
Demand economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just so many foods that it meets the needs of the farmer and his / her family.
The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological type of cultivation, which uses saved seeds in the eco-region and combines them with alternating fields or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers operated subsistence economies, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring like-minded people together who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop an identity feeling.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place and / or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called" wild "or wild. Some wild children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolfskinder may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
When raised completely by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the scope of its physical possibilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation, for example when using a new computer program or when starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the small paperclip male in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is integrated into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone may not be able to handle.
For a variety of reasons, children are accommodated in foster families for various reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care accommodation system is a piece of security for these children.
Our family care system is intended to provide a safe home, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care.
The care unit is intended to cover all the needs they had not received in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific peculiarities of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal Commitment" and "Permanent Relations" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the audience reactions on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can see if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President ’ s speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who can no longer understand language because of a brain damage can still properly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Outside in the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as the human to cover its need for amino acid from available herbal sources.
Moreover, it has serious consequences if one fails to do so: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of target-oriented waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep short time (10 to 60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without completely awakening you.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythm is to drink a lot of fluid before going to sleep (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect), so that one is forced to get up for urination.
The degree of inner calm that a person possesses correlates in reverse with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the path of the love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini is used to awaken Kundalini ’ s energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Gods ’ Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should continue for the next 40 years and be carried out in reality by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a reconstruction along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet Non-aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The mission of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy ’ s ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. Americans tried to bring staff and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently already domesticated in the Zāgros mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House-goats were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. The goats were looked after by goats, quite similar to the more well-known shepherds; often the children or adolescents were. These pasture methods are still applied today.
Already in the 16th century they built conveyor tracks in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses, which pulled the wagons, to reach higher speeds and to draw greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early in order to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, the realization prevailed that rails carrying a belt of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of movement was walking. Man began to go upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go so regularly upright.
Double-footed species are found in Australopithecus and fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you do not just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is truly obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
Following its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap ’ s printing house a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. London reached a copy on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broad pages that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that still exist. The original manuscript did not survive the times.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that there is a group of dinosaurs who survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things on birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing can be the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See on the label for specific first aid instructions for this special poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasiting people.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle-aged age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that in women, the likelihood of MS disease is twice as high as in men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the physical parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenthood.
The main objective of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. Indeed, this method is the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also conducted by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues including psychology were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of body own cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Of a cycle certain behaviours, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining oscillators that perform free-oscillating cycles for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they either marked the DNA of phages with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have various effects depending on the type of mutation involved, the significance of the genetic material in question, and whether the cells concerned are germ membrane cells.
Only mutations in germ membrane cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Near-nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photographing and studying Orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose job is at the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in a way connected to a transport system based on the private car and supports it.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has borne human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in the company and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such grievances, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental here?
Traffic flow is the investigation of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% safety.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be shown mathematically roughly.
To better illustrate traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of equipment on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find more efficient food and sex partners.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider choice of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and one day flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) was moving around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since it does not appear to you as if the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some up to six miles wide.
A whole 20 percent of the water that flows across the planet ’ s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon Main Stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids of Giza and the technical perfection of their construction were never exceeded.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then a good thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and degraded with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, established the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): detected, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also established the theory that they turn into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillion of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Accordingly, after his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has fallen into the background so that it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharper.
You may be curious what will become of the keyboard when something new comes.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that one needs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Approximately as if one rolls up a heavy wagon a hill. If the core is split again, a part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate with little or no impulse.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or responds to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or desires that are internalized in the course of their adulthood.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences they have in their environment to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow ’ s theory of necessity hierarchy and Hertzberg ’ s two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities, and making employees obligatory.
At the other end of the spectrum one turns into an unrecognizable individual, who has to do everything differently than the team has done it and makes everything his own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to discrepancies between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are guided according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The" invisible team "is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organization take the time-consuming process to introduce a learning organisation? Innovation is a goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to respond to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum ’ s concept as a method to help organizations become more powerful.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, they limit the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect the behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
Newly emerging technologies enable us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the production of machines for the automation of tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, setting up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
Today, the AI system is widely used in business, medicine, engineering and military applications and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important component for every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to bring her students to places where a bus ride is not suitable.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum objects from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their journey to the capital of the state. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. While students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience.
As students are often a very critical audience, the Blogautor makes an effort to improve its writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to awaken the audience's interest inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada ’ s enchanting bilingual capital and is characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that present Canada ’ s past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others characterize Ontario as what outsiders consider to be typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the US than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and on the Comoros and in Mayotte he was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (only none that looks too expensive.
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider to be an assault, and that it is not unusual to be pursued by arms, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don ’ t be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences back or forth; that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s fine yet!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the era and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to give it up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of Tinnef are sold, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo ’ s volcano, which buried most of the city ’ s streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, every stay outside Gomas should be carefully planned to experience the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackingtours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese francs for short journeys.
This in combination with its relative inaccessibility has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at risk due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates PBS and special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country ’ s cities because it has an Arab flair rather than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km ² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It can also be worthwhile to buy a wild card that grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name giver for the Hong Kong Territory and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering bar chart visible through the presence of Victoria Harbour waters. x
For the best views of Hong Kong you should leave the island and drive to the opposite bank of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island ’ s urban development is densely packed with newly-won land along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonists have made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretch over 80 km from the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the border plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km ², one third of which is covered with water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal Kingfishers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart the whole day from the district-crossing bus station (on the other side of the river), where most buses, especially those in the east and Jakar / Bumthang, depart between 06: 30 and 07: 30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are driven by small Japanese coaster buses, which are cozy and stable.
Collective taxis offer a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is an oblique cable bridge. It spans the river Oyapock and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French and Guayana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, their length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The passage height below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the clearance for transport was not completed until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's East Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who also operated subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by chasing, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of Western India, was formed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known to be one of the best in the world for its polo team and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can be watched here at other times of the year.
You can find information about competitions and sales points for polo tickets at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is determined in accordance with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley and Credit Cards. Also US Dollar are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and US currency can be accepted; check in advance with the owners which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money from the island before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is there summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above + 30 ° C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and humidity cause it to feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rain or dry times: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the parking authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards / meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards / meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peacefully bisons, wapitis, moose, bears and practically all big animals can work, it can happen that they move to the attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so let them have enough space.
Also, be aware that odours can attract bears and other wild animals. So, avoid carrying or cooking heavily fragrant foods with you, and pay attention to a clean warehouse.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the fifties of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a glorious patent of the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except a British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland extends over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you worry, you will also find bottled water without problems.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee is foreign" "Flat White" ". A small black one is" "Espresso" ", cappuccino is filled up with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to some of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to security warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near the beach and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Salt water crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he has a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also keep your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that music is still played until late into the night on parts of the festival, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking through ice causes quite terrible noise for the most affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually try hard to keep guests on site for as long as possible and spend a lot of money. There are usually neither windows nor clocks, and outputs are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure that they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Those who want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point.
On icy and snowy roads, the adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
With snow storms so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or floating snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a country trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with a binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bushwalk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after being the venue of the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could get into a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March most cancellation policy due to the Coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympic Games were planned.
One assumes that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 ¥and 130,000 ¥, an average ticket about 7,000 ¥.
The room was very clean and clean.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hair dryer if there is one.
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for purifying water. Some of them prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation, or, at worst, trigger allergic reactions, administrate poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violate or kill people are usually not classified as vermin.
Custom-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods that are exempt from levies and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has a high level of taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on Highway Buffalo Pittsburgh is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep in mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves prevail here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35 mph (56 mph / h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, mobile coverage is much better here than in many other areas of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as the southern neighbour of Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely used, with apples boiled all year round and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich bakery products, try what is called Berlin, pancakes or doughnuts, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.

With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a term that embraces a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now spread all over the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. Javanese prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the rider may get caught in them.
When a rider falls from the horse and gets caught with his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along when the horse passes through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup belt to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you can attach your skis or snowboard to your feet and descend a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skiers" who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first free time skiing club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or skiing.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, since the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions you are able to travel a little longer distances than when hiking - very rarely you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has many independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for visas several times and go through several passport controls if one wants to travel through several countries.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions a little like a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can normally cross borders without having to re-control your passport.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a single visa for each of the Schengen countries, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques; some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical deviations where the age limit in areas such as North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique", although they are younger than similar products from mass production.
The reindeer breeding is an important source of the Sámi livelihood, and the culture around trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also in the past not all Sámi bred reindeer in great style, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer kept them mainly as migratory animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Discussions are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views shown are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disturbances or loss of life.
Weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water trousers and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather conditions include blizzards, snow storms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urgently warned to pay attention to any kind of storm affecting their territory, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should do a professional training for it.
"An Internet search for" "Course on hostile environments" "will probably display the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all problems discussed here much more detailed, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role play, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning a gender equality operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports of unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
Searches for security controls have also become much more intrusive after 11 September 2001.
Transgender persons before their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing the scanner.
Cracks are the recurring current of waves broken on the beach, often in reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast flow up to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get anywhere where you are not caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and depending on whether you have been noticed, you should perhaps wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
It may not be expected that returning travellers will require patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is still before the show begins.
Usually you can always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The history of sounds and light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, where the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen lake.
The mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth's mountains, which is divided into two by Minnesota's glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off are study and course offers abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off in front of the university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, participation in a foreign bridging year may actually improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for the application to these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
For the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coasts of islands and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, every sixth or eighth has a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while returning in the evening and staying overnight on the ship.
If you only go ashore in the course of the Bordex excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer in their brochures Berlin in Germany as a destination. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a scary experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have a traumatic experience.
You don ’ t have to be ashamed of this: this is nothing but the personal fears and antipathy that many people have.
Learning more about the operation of aircraft and the procedures during a flight can help some to overcome the fear associated with the unknown or with the feeling that they have no control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor in company documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies there were difficulties.
When they sent things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage, and the airlines' rules do not allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come into play.
The obvious way to fly in First or Business Class is to add a big batch of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to pay the costs).
But this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb you can expect that you will have to pay up to four times the normal Economy Rate for business and elffache for the first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for seats on direct flights from A to B even for discounts for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and demand corresponding prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian orthodox.

Please treat this place with the dignity, reverence and respect that you deserve. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not trade the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs are, however, only indicated in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.

Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisern is said to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often only an incorrect cliché, one finds one's best way of getting around in Paris when one shows oneself from one's best side and behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved), which will make it considerably easier to cope with.
The perch exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, various soils and varying altitudes, it has a remarkable variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and Auerhühner as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach over their knees and cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are wraps for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Analogous to this, men must wear trousers that reach over their knees.
Also these can be borrowed at the entrance from the stock, but the clothes will not be washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a unit size!
The Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) in similar areas of the Mediterranean, and always uses olive oil.

"All nouns start next to the word you for" "you" "always with a capital letter, also in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a tunword or property word is used as a main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters you have to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the subsequent vowel.

Pre-modern observatories are normally no longer in operation and serve as museums or places of education.
As light pollution did not present the problem it is today during its high phase, they are usually located in cities or university premises that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Considering cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Many of the traditions surrounding the feast have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries throughout the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter Vigil awake at some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter watch on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the congregations often beginning at midnight, during which the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or flooding.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first people entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
When you visit the Arctic or Antarctica regions in winter, you will experience the Arctic Night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Light, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and the light pollution is therefore often no problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits belong to the usual business clothes and colleagues address themselves with their surnames or activity names.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual performance.
