Although evidence suggests that an experimental vaccine is capable of reducing Ebola mortality, no drug has so far demonstrated its ability to treat the infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in this field, but other formal studies pointed to it having less of an expected benefit in preventing mortality.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other drugs to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes the imperative need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, could be better served by thinking ahead to a significant change within our organization, rather than withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuses of dimensions so boldly described by Larry Nassar's survivors could go unnoticed for so long and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics as a sport, as well as others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.
It was during the 1960s when Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and then for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (an already widespread theory) and also provides other data that fossils generally do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were brownish above and pale below or carotenoid.
The find also offers a perspective on how feathers evolved in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed canon, called a raquis, but do have other feather-like features (beards and barbels), researchers have deduced that the raquis probably represents a later evolution of those other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or as ornamentation. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and is not the plumage of a young calf.
The researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and is not the plumage of a young calf.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, left two police officers dead and more than 20 people injured.

They found that the Sun follows the same basic principles as the rest of the stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a stellar Rossby number, related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less activity the star will have relative to magnetic inversions.

The work performed was fundamentally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Saxitarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way pulls on the Saxitarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke rising from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off the air conditioning and not drink the water brought in.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and cause for alarm, because of its very high mortality rate".
It is possible that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were health workers there.
Within a year, an infected person could infect 10 or 15 of his immediate contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall TB group still appears to be low, 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

The government has also pledged several million vials of encephalitis vaccine injectable, which will allow agencies to be ready by next year.
Plans to distribute vaccines this year in historically hard-hit areas have been delayed due to lack of funding and low priority for other diseases.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are colder than the surface around them during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the Earth's large caves, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is similar to that of large holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University astrogeology team in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an almost technologically unavailable experience: voters enter a voting booth and insert a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the chosen candidate inside an envelope.
Once the officials verify the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter registration.
French electoral law codifies the procedure in a very strict way.
Since 1988, the polls have been transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots are inserted at the start of the vote, nor are envelopes added, except those of duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each and every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers conduct the vote counting under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son.
He is being held pending indictment and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be tampered with due to the extensive publication of his image.
This is common practice in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered the publication of the photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee points out that journalists seem to be following a dangerous line when publishing photos, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office, which generally handles court proceedings, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the charges are formalised.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians demand to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to maintain that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control test would be closely monitored by guards, during the supervision of the test and the evaluation of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunt operation were given thorough safety training and guidelines.
Martelly invested yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine people.
It's Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to widespread protests against the regime that began in October with the commission.
Occasionally violent protesters have been dispersed by the inability to hold elections, some pending since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPod failures were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it had 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling it "truly regrettable" that Apple delayed the report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that no tsunami report was made.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released in the first instance, as well as the photographers from the Philippines.
Afterwards, the photographers swapped out for an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a tocologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying preterm births in her spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that when the hormone was given, it accelerated the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered the two flight recorders, the "black boxes".
Fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first representative. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Something extraordinary, almost like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents to the survey share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the survey, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to problems with his fitness he is in the air.
He couldn't take the medication he needs to endure the pain because it's forbidden in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and university professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever.
Numerous people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, which was made public on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the origin of water reaching Earth along with organic matter that can create proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and fights".
Rumor has it that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being offered and subways will not stop at Wembley; parking and park-and-ride are not available on the surface.
Fears of lack of transportation opened the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's nightclubs.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden pointed out that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have been much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's bell pepper (geospiza forte) and a Spanish cactus pepper (geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be made into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and glued to other metals. Its thickness can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings, called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can create an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
The color of cabbage changes depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H of pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean, damp hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cisterns in virtually every house, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewer systems have been found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were also bathrooms, and in Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes part of public baths, shared by men and women equally.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere warps some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most important thing it has done for us is to offer us easier and faster modes of transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below these, there are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the idea of the niche, a specialized job that each cat has assigned and prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called packs.
Herds consist of one to three adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act in a manner very similar to a wolf or dog suit, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not to other large cats) in their behavior and also highly lethal to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can bounce (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and shoot with a force five times greater than a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not the same as the full roar of a lion, but rather a phrase with words roared into screams.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find prey using their sense of smell, slithering where they have moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move around quietly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be at that time.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it also begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can breathe out (i.e., expel through the breath).
Plants produce their sun food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants, we make clothes with plants, and most of the food we eat is also made with plants.
Mosasaur was the greatest predator of its time and was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long cheek was adorned with over 70 knife-sharp teeth, plus an additional paddle play in the mouth, which meant that nothing that came in its way had a way out.
We can't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bipedal tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-rex would not be a rival to it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a handful of odd or unusual feasting items, including turkey, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a leirón.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they could recline on one side while eating.
The dining menus of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconuts, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that is only accessible to priests.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes erected to integrate as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot Middle Eastern climate, houses didn't matter that much.
Most of the life of the Hebrew families was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and while traveling west, he found a territory he named Greenland.
Despite their discovery, the Eskimos were already living there.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many distinctions between the people, the kings, the traditions and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Hunt, you probably think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even if there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, this document was kept on a large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) and was wrapped.
So it's likely that this annotation is simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still invaded.
It was ruled by Vichy France, French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward the Germans.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a sizeable group of people who live and work cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, relative to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also to some extent defines the size of a society.
A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through different generations, a lasting cultural legacy and considerable dissemination.
Smaller civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations of their own.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and with no national executive or legislature to enforce all its laws, it depended on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
Nor did it have the authority to invalidate tax legislation or tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Some popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheel hockey and Formula 1 competition.
Winter sports enjoy more popularity in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an archipelago.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European navigators recorded the island's name as  Formosa Island or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, thus beginning the transformation of the production practices of large aborigines and employing Chinese workers who worked on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By 1976, 30% of the restoration of Machu Picchu had been completed, which continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed-image photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more important is the aspect ratio that the digital camera image sensor formats inherited.
The 35 mm format, in fact and for greater confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve the simplest integer ratio is obtained) is said to be 3:2.
Different common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The overly-recurring and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under fire.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His dominant power in all areas affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this piar was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain planted mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to prevent a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter recommending him to Thomas Edison by Charles Batchelor (manager at his last job).
In ancient China there was a unique method of showing the different time periods; each era of China or each dynasty that came to power was a particular dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, a bloody war broke out between different nobles who were trying to take the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest post in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, occupations were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
The same thing happens with the military, because the ranks in the army instead of being based on class, they became based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters related to the afterlife, and he frequently went to a cave that came to be known as "Hirana" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
That same cave, which has survived the passage of time, provides an intense picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of the mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find out at all if one knew it existed.
Nothing is seen but the beautiful clear sky above the many mountains around it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures that were built in honor of the death of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Necropolis of Giza in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu while a number of other smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upper  arch mark looks like a V and the lower  arch mark looks like a staple or a square with the bottom half missing.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, while down means you should start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward motion of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward motion is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that the printed marks on the bow are there for a musical purpose, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), as well as the king's sister, Madame Isabelle, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The gentleman forced the king and queen to take the carriage windows open.
At one point, a mob member slashed the head off a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 to 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological drive or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that reaches beyond cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass vehicle ownership also generates a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geographical context emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of that society, proved better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its sound as a luxury cradle began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, due primarily to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was around this time that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its heyday in the period between the 10th or 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create their own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to button their clothes.
Subsistence farming is done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system that uses stored seeds native to that ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all of these factors.
Members of a subculture often make their association apparent through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, manner of acting, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate cases of boys who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
Some wild boys have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these boys is due to the rejection by the parents of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone away from civilization.
When raised by non-human animals, feral youngsters show behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, my stay goes one step further.
Staying is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to individuals who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new software program, or starting a new project.
The stays can be both virtual and real, i.e. the master or maestra is a form of stay, but so is the clip in the form of a male in Microsoft Office.
Virtual environments are built into the software and are intended to question, provoke and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children enter foster care for a wide range of different reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child or girl should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affectionate and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for this girl.
It's taken for granted that our non-adoption system provides safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Adoption in foster mode is supposed to provide all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in the relative approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech as a result of brain damage suffered are nevertheless able to determine sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research conducted in the 20th century showed that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of variation expressed.
Segregation and recombination mix up and down variations between both reservoirs in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its requirements for amino acids from existing plants.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences - increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digested and provide a large volume of protein that complements all essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a relatively similar way to chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking during normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively silent wake-up device that helps you return to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find that you end up delaying the alarm without waking up, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing you to have to get up to move.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. All people have the potential to find peace and absolute contentment.
Everyone can achieve a state of enlightenment, and the only thing that stands between us and that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism draws on the teachings of Buddha, but these were extended by the Mahayana way of love as well as many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through visualization of the different deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are reactivated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next forty years and it was actually fought, through representative armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other different places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight when 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Russia-Poland Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their own.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it had in the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have first been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more commonly known herders.
waggonways (horse-drawn carriages on rails) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads on the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The rails were introduced very early to secure the rails in position, however, gradually it became apparent that the rails would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused a stronger wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels replaced iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, australopitecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Biped specialization is found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelanthrope already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's equivalent to treating the symptoms, but if we don't want a solution that's purely temporary, we should look at the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably as a result of humanity's scientific and technological advances and that problems have increased because of overpopulation and excessive human lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the Speaker of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a couple of blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
That very night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap flyers known are the oldest copies still preserved of this document.
Different paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
These birds have many features that are still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs just like T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today start from manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household substances.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term originates from the classic familiarity with bed bugs, insects with a great capacity for adaptation to parasitize on humans.
Both the redwoods and the bed bugs are predators, adapted to live in their own nests or in those of their host.
In the United States alone, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or that of the child to raise a child.
These couples may choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another partner can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works by scientific methods.
It is not merely by experimentation, but rather the experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted in all matters pertaining to science, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West became detached from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are merely responses to external periodic patterns, in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free operation even in the absence of external guidelines.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the first to suggest that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulphide.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their class, the relevance of the element of the compromised genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are likely to be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-focused tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape, as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, in addition to studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces, crossing paths with others whose work destination is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is somehow connected and supports the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massive, coal-dependent economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
We all participate in society and use transportation.
In developed countries, you rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some other more basic problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and private vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave within reasonably consistent margins; thus, traffic flows usually have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To obtain a better representation of traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan and design traffic service operations.
Insects were the first to fly, and their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the devil's knights and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others thought otherwise; the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
About 20 percent of the total water in the world's rivers that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed those at Giza in size or technical superiority.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population density.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while in religious ceremonies Latin is often used.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humanity has known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized on the principle that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it was also theorized that they transform into new substances that give shape to what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more materials.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and uses.
Now people can type messages on their computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy wagon up the coast, and when you split the core again, then you release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at its nearest point and 100 km at its farthest.
It is thinner below the marshes and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more of the sea on the near side, because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on research that motivates people or that they find attractive.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things in their environment will lead them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviors can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues. At one extreme they will try to continue to be just another colleague.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and demanding responsibilities from people.
On the other side of the coin, you become an unrecognizable individual who believes that you should change everything the team has done and embrace it as your own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respond to the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which national management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of setting up an organization that encourages learning?
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flow.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that responds to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognition research, thus narrowing down the research area and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supported by scientific research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides a wealth of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our minds.
Although AI has strong nuances of science fiction, it constitutes an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research seeks to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to patient diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These kinds of things have evolved into independent disciplines, which try to provide solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been integrated into multiple home software applications and video games.
Excursions are a very important part of any classroom, and often teachers would love to take their students to places where bus travel is not feasible.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school visits, where students can see museum equipment, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from their desks.
Sharing a virtual school field trip can also be a great way to reflect on the field trip and shared experiences with other classes in the future.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is remodeled, but previous versions are kept online to act as a scrapbook.
While students often start their blogging experiences by showing poor command of grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually makes them change.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog editor begins to work on improving his writing and avoiding criticism.
The need to nurture the public's interests inspires students to show their intelligence and be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "enables students to have a more analytical and critical spirit; by offering an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what is written by other people, as well as define their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's lovely bilingual capital city with a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider intrinsically Canadian.
Large areas to the north are barely populated and many are virtually uninhabited wilderness areas.
Here's a comparison of populations that may surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated nations of France and are famous for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region which settled deep in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women traveling here are advised to state that they are married, regardless of marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a wedding ring (which doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could lead to something they would consider harassment and it is common to chase them, grab their arms, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to assert your position (whether for cultural differences or not, this is not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, only to finally abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders, who established trading bases there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the outskirts of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as taxis, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but all of these are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the city's streets, particularly the city center, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be investigated to learn about the state of the ongoing confrontation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base from which to climb Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (mototaxi).
Along with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
Today, Timbuktu is a very poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was a main stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast to the rest of the country, with its more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northwestern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which maintains different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It is also likely to be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the entire territory and is the place that many tourists consider to be the most relevant.
The parade of buildings that define the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bright bar chart that is evident by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you will have to leave the island and head to Kowloon Pier on the opposite bank.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the north coast.
The British colonists took this place as their own, so if you're looking for samples of the territory's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangroves on the planet, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Forests are not mere mangrove swamps: they include some of the last remnants of the towering jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 cheetahs in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (crossing the river) uninterrupted throughout the day, but most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30 h.
Since buses between districts are usually full, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts have the service of small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and solid vehicles.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient method of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a truss bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 metres, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes of 3.50 metres wide.
The tunnel under the bridge is 15 metres long and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the giant province of the Indies, was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain to a large extent its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in equivalence to the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted in all islands and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted on Stanley itself.
In the outlying islands, credit cards are not likely to be accepted, although British and US currencies will be accepted; the landlord should be consulted in advance to determine the most acceptable payment method.
It is practically impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange it before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winters can be disappointingly cool: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost unchanged throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, they are still wildlife that should not be fed or tamed.
Park management recommends keeping at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping the proper distance, and these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they should be given space.
Also, it should be noted that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so you should avoid carrying or cooking food that smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
They sank all but one British cruiser, killing about 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau-led independence struggle, a peaceful demonstration in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland is located between two ports, it has many beaches.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are safe sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Bay in the elegant residential areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They tend to be very busy family beaches with a good variety of shops along the coast.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many types of French wine to choose from, but New Zealanders and Australians are probably better able to handle travel.
Local water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if in doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee with milk is foreign. A coffee is just an espresso, the cappuccino carries a layer of whipped cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate in the bowl meets the Belgian expectations.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year and reef injuries are rare.
However, the advice of the authorities should be followed, the signs should be followed and special attention should be paid to safety warnings.
The jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of the year 1770 and can occasionally be found outside that time.
The toads do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have deals with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport or even combined air and hotel packages.
You can also save the reservation if you need time to evaluate the offer or to look for other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or requests should be handled first through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp inside the festival itself and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
To be closer to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
It should not be forgotten that even if the music ends on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young girls.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing through the ice generates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
St. Petersburg cruises include a time in the city.
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and staying in the premises.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
People who are going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low, so you cannot drive in the same way you would on normal asphalt.
During a slide in a very short space of time, enough snow can fall to get you trapped.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or cracks or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries and traffic remains virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to surface travel to see the impressive African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, can get very close to cars, so regular equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so the best way to see them is with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a hike, hiking safari, or footing) is a hiking activity that takes place over a period of a few hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, the situation may get complicated.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellations will not go beyond July 2020, the scheduled date of the Olympics.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average entrance cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a cast iron and table available for use even if they are not in your own room.
If a cast iron is not available or you do not feel like applying the iron to your socks, you can try using a hairdryer, in case you have one.
Do not allow the material to overheat (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases by themselves or dangerous animals with the ability to injure or kill people by force are generally not considered pests.
Shopping at Duty Free is an opportunity to purchase items duty-free and excise duty-free in certain places.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the middle of nowhere.
If you are not used to driving on secondary roads, keep calm - steep ridges, narrow lanes, and tight turns predominate.
The speed limits indicated are considerably lower than those of the front and rear sections (generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and their strict adherence is even more important than the reverse.
However, it is interesting that mobile phone service has more coverage here than on other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good and, in Bavaria, they are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors: Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked in the confectionery throughout the year, with cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, honey and other types of nuts. Popular biscuits often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try some hard, consistent cakes, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used to cook curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the typical food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a range of simple condiment dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by Javanese being peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and different aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang downwards on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged by the horse if he jumps to escape.
First, most motorists wear high-heeled boots and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle when pulling it back in case the rider falls.
The Cochamo Valley, Chile's main destination for climbing practice, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks have breathtaking views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are continually laying new routes through its walls of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding downhill over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity, with many followers, occasionally referred to as "ski people", planning entire ski holidays in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting female skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Excursion skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, tourism skiing or hiking skiing.
It is related, though it does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, as the latter is done on sloping terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
You should think of the ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, slightly longer distances than on foot can be covered, but only occasionally will cross-country ski speeds be reached without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for different visas and going through multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen area in this sense functions to some extent as a single country.

Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured object an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.

Craft products could be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar items produced on a large scale.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding its trade is important for many other professions as well.
Even traditionally, not all Sami participated in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, caring for reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.

The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents also varies considerably.
Security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people pre-surgery will not be required to undergo scans to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the flow that returns from waves after they break against the beach, usually against a reef or similar.
Because of the topology of groundwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and it is possible for a fast current to form towards the deep waters from that point.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may prove impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
It should be tried again in an area where there is no possibility of being trapped or, depending on the swimming ability and whether it has already been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The shock of the return occurs before the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their home culture again.
When returning home after living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of one's own.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
People may anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed with travelers returning home.

The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range reaching 4,892 m (15,980 ft).
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, satellite phone is likely to be the only possible option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outside with a direct satellite line to be able to make a call.
This service is often used for shipments, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice.
The local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who have decided to take a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among high school seniors, who can take a year off before entering college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
In general, an enrolment fee is applied to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak allow for a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is still quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include an extension of the stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and sleep back on the boat at night.
If you only plan to land with the excursions on board, you will not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin (Germany) in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

For some, understanding a little about how an airplane works and what happens during flight could help them overcome fears based on the unknown or not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering items quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If items were sent by airmail, it might take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The only way to get it there before that was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations prohibit sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
An obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have the company pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule, you could pay four times the price of a regular business class ticket and up to eleven times that of a first class ticket!
Generally, it is not worthwhile to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a special group of passengers who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, with the corresponding fare.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in western Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were re-established between those two parts of Moldova despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

The abrupt exterior of Parisians will evaporate quickly if a few basic manners are shown.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has a dense forest mass, mainly beech trees, different types of spruce, such as fir and false fir, and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a considerably wide variety of plant communities, due to its extensive range of microclimates, different soils and range of altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animals and bird species.
Here you can find exotic fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, flies, lynxes, wild cats and mountain lions, in addition to many other common species.
On visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts up to the knees and also cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries offer cloths for women who do not come without being prepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive the monk or nun's smile at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover them up to the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pile in the lobby, but those clothes don't wash after each use, so you may not feel comfortable or comfortable wearing those skirts.

Many of the traditions surrounding this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night in a vigil in an open place to watch the sun rise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely a pre-Christian ritual to extol spring and fertility.
