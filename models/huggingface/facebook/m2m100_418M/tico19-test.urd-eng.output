European Union/European Economic Relations and Britain rapidly increased the total rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during 1 January to 15 March 2020
The European Union/European Economic Area and the UK are showing similar tendencies in the total number of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) while COVID-19 is growing rapidly in different stages in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, several countries, hospitals and extreme care units should increase their rate in the place of rapid increase in COVID-19 patients because they will require special extreme care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of unknown cause samples were in the Chinese province of Hubei in Wuhan.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Center for Disease Care and Prevention announced that the medical agent is Nool Coronavirus which is now known as severe respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection was called coronavirus disease (COVID-19) .
Today’s evidence is that 80% of people who suffer COVID-19 have thirty illnesses, i.e., with or without the symptoms, and most of them become healthier.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 occurs in the case of more severe illness, which requires hospitalization, while in 6% of cases, those diagnosed with severe illness requires extreme care.
The number of patients in hospitals caused by COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we will identify the tendencies in the total output of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/EEA (EU/EEA) and Britain (UK) and balance them from the province of China.
We also balance the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and Britain with the Italian for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain
After China, more geographical growth occurred in COVID-19, and the rest of the world's COVID-19's global state of movement was in accordance with the same country at the time.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on March 11, 2020 that COVID-19 will be a global body.
In the number of 5 March 2020 of the Euroservices, Sprietta Ital cases of the first Europe-certified COVID-19 according to the WHO’s case definition.
The first three certified cases in the EU/EEA were by three French persons returning from the Hubei province of China on 24 January 2020.
By 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and Britain (UK)I had a track record of COVID-19 cases, under which from 31 December 2019 to the present date there are national information of 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths will only be in Italy.
Get the total number of cases of COVID-19 and the total number of subjects
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Prevention (ECDC) is based on the number of COVID-19 cases in every country around the world from the official reports, the Ministry of Health, National and Relational Health officials and the World Health Administration daily at 8:00 a.m.
They were used to evaluate the COVID-19 risks in the EU/EEA and Britain and to balance them from Italy.
As a follow-up of the active COVID-19 cases, we accounted for the 14 days of the COVID-19 total follow-up, taking into account the power course of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We balanced with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 and presented the total number of notified cases in each country until 8:00 am on 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain
In general, the EU/EEA countries and the UK’s COVID-19’s 14-day part-time total contributors are in accordance with the Province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In total, for the EU/EEA and Britain, the 21th of February began the increase in the total supply of the COVID-19 and then the 28th of February 2020 accelerated the increase (assurance materials).
This occurred due to the rapid increase in the number of cases from more Italy, but the total revenue of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and Britain has also shown increasing risks (assurance materials).
In Figure 2, the total number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and Britain, compared to Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020, is shown.
It was clearly stated that, on March 15, at 8:00 am, only 3 weeks before or less, the total number of cases in the EU/EEA other 15 countries and in Britain will be in advance.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and Britain is rapidly increasing.
COVID-19's overall outcomes show that it is increasing by balanced behavior in all countries around the world.
Despite the fact that countries are in different stages, changes in the response of national health and the possibility of different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients in which it is necessary to approve COVID-19 including the kitch-up attachment.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy a situation in which approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients needed extreme care, and the report that the hospitals and extreme care units in those areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, on the EU/EEA level, the numbers related to the cases of COVID-19 are available in any hospital and/or end-care unit for the cases respectively 6% and 1% (the numbers are not shown).
However, the number of concerns, in which the reports of cases and the number of deaths have been completed, should be admitted to the regular scale.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there was a significant change in the achievement of high-quality and high-quality hospitals from 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that in those countries there will be less and more medium-sized means (11 in 2010 there are 12.5 extreme and medium-sized places for every 100,000 inhabitants).
Additional model work guidelines related to health care authority, measurements of cases of COVID-19 entering hospitals in each EU/EEA country and Britain that are dependent on exceeding >90% of infertility from the infertility of extreme infertility, COVID-19 was provided in the sixth update of ECDC's sharp infertility diagnosis.
Since so far the EU/EEA countries and specific regions of Britain have cases restricted, and generally the Office and Extremely Protected Units explain the population of the relationship line, the information on cases and Extremely Protected Units facilitates the accessible numeration of the relationship figures of the preferred number 2 (NUTS-2).
The Italian situation and the existing tendencies from other countries show that COVID-19’s global network has spread rapidly into the EU/EEA and Britain.
Countries, hospitals and extreme care units should keep themselves prepared for SARS-CoV-2's independent community transfer, and the additional COVID-19 patients, such as the affected areas of Italy, need special health care and extreme care.
As the current ECDC acute disorder diagnosis, I have stated that a sharp, active and comprehensive point of view is necessary for the delay in SARS-COV-2's follow-up, which can be combined with a change in the reduction point of view, if there is no earlier action income on it, the expected rapidly increase in the number of cases will not provide the decision makers and officers with enough time to understand, submit and follow their reactions.
There is also a list of health care measures to reduce the effects of the worldwide health.
Here is a small time when the countries could add more to their efforts to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 emissions and to reduce the impact on those who keep the health.
Failure in this, it is possible that health care regulators in the EU/EEA countries will be caused by the need for extreme care due to additional patients in the coming days or weeks.
The most severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to the consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people affected anywhere in China and the world, the result of which is devastating to humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-Cov, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also spread due to the lungs and also cause these signs through a similar microma.
However, compared to SARS, COVID-19 has less difficulty and described deaths, but it affects more women than teenagers than age-old people and men.
In response to the rapidly increased number of rumors about the inflammatory disease, this Arctic tries to provide a bright and comprehensive review of the rapidly advanced research content.
We will cover the basic things about diseases, virology, web, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although the answers to many questions are still understood, we hope that this review will help to understand this dangerous disease and end it.
The season of January 25 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable reminder for all Chinese people due to the emphasis of all vaccines from the spread of viral disease and staying in the houses for several weeks.
This virus is extremely homologated with coronavirus (CoV) which caused severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) to spread in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its related disease was named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19)
It began in China's city of Wuhan and rapidly spread across the country and around the world in 50 other countries.
By March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 deaths were confirmed as a result of the virus.
WHO has that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the year" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PUBMED (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, COVID-19 has published more than 200 articles, which includes its virology, website, causes, treatment and diagnosis after the first report of 7 January 2020 and which has been determined to model multiple patients.
In this award, a new and rapidly developed subject has been attempted to resolve the creation of progress in the field.
Whenever possible, we will try to balance COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, the Eastern Central Respiratory Syndrome (MERS spreading in 2012).
We will talk about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease as well as about the remaining important questions that have been learned so far.
For humans, traditionally, CoV has been considered a non-maline phytogenic, essentially causing about 15% of the general decline of 4.
However, in this century to us, two extremely mild CoVs, SARS CoVs and MERS-CoVs, came to us, who found this drug in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon this terrible disease spread to many other countries with its description of deaths.
So the existing COVID-19 has a recorded history of humans.
As shown in the form, in Figure.1, I was first to the China National Highway Commission on December 31, 2019 on the examples of which scores are unknown.
Seven days later, the order of CoV went on.
On January 15, 2020, the first John Liva case occurred in Wuhan.
The two doors, and with us, spread into cities, provinces and nations.
On 20 January, the health careers were informed of infection, which meant that it could be transmitted from man to man.
On 23 January, he was locked down by blocking all public transportation in the city of Wuhan.
In the first medical study on this disease on 24 January, it was that, in the confirmed cases, only 21 of 41 patients were in direct contact with the market of wild seafood food, which is considered by an unknown person of the animals the point of the beginning of this infection.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it is a global health status.
Until this report arrived, the disease was already spread across China and 50 countries around the world (Figure.
Because the situation is fast, so it remains uncertain and strong.
On February 11, 2020, 8,866 patients, including 4,021 certified COVID-19 patients, were described in a multiple study in one and the latest explanatory list of these patients (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially people aged 65-30 years.
Approximately half of the people affected (47.7%) were older than 50 years old, less than 20 years old and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS -CoV-2 affected more than women (0.27/100,000) men (0.31/100,000).
Basically, COVID-19 was placed in the Hubei and its as-pass areas.
The diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 (9-2) days from the beginning.
The average growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic production number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the indexed R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to large-scale transportation times in China before the spring miles, the number of affected persons before June 23, 2020 increased rapidly.
The patient’s indication of certified cases was 1.44% (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the identified indication of all patients was 3.06% (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%)
The three major dangerous elements of COVID-19 are gender (man), age (≥60), and severe samples.
CoVs is a substance of large and file viruses, which contain the composition of sensory RNA.
They are divided into four generations: Elva, Beta, Gama and Delta, from which Elva and Beta-CoVsans go to influence.
The file spike (S) glycoprotein is linked to the inzymes 2 (ACE2) and the peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) in line with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the fertilizer’s fusion.
Viral genes are released into the sato plasma, then after the transfer of viral genes, the genes with the RNA build the derivative version of the glucose milk and the new clyde, which are then fused to leave the virus with the plasma discharge.
The first genome series of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
More than 99.98% of SARS-CoV-2 genetic recognition of a new section of the SARS-CoV-2 was found in the 10 samples collected from the original position of the Hanoi seafood food market.
The SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV are more genetic than the SARS-CoV.
Instead of the transmission of electrical microscopy, the particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found on the extremely narrow portion of the epithemy of the human respiratory canal.
Human ACE2 was found as a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2, but also for SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2’s S milk is more vulnerable than SARS-CoV to human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV causes low infection compared to SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form null-shart fat encoded through orf3b and pure fat through orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play its role in the viral phytogenic station and expose itself in IFNB, but there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhao It Al, a complex contract in the EM facilities with the Amino Acid Transporter B0AT1 with the human ACE2 in 2.9 Å details.
They found that the complexity, in which the open and band changes were activated from a diameter status and the complexity of ACE2-B0AT1 could establish the two S compounds, which confirm CoVki recognition and infection.
SARS-CoV-2 infection can be used as a B0AT1 treatment for the screening of medications in the stomach.
The original and the original.
It is known that, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, starting from both membranes, were transmitted to humans through cells and onts.
By comparing the SARS-CoV-2 with the other CoVs, the bacteria is considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is similar to the two SARS- such as the CoVs bit-SL-CoVZX45 and the bit-SL-COVZX21 of the 96% bacteria.
Nevertheless, it is not yet possible that the middle representative has helped to pass the rocks to affect mankind, and that the truth of the transition cannot be explained.
J, Y, L, was prescribed to take the spots from the spots and to take the viral disease to humans, which includes the homeological condition within the proteins of S.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China have prescribed according to a study that the most commonly used lamp sensitive pinguins in traditional Chinese medicine, chuanti-fooding milk, pinguins and SARS-CoV-2 can be a possible average representative of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of sex.
However, the 1% difference in the two genes is still a very big difference, as well, the definitive results of the comprehensive agreement are expected (Figure 33).
The major physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live up to 48 hours in a dry environment and less than 20 ° C and up to 40%-50% in a temperature of up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features.
It has been that, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to high-inflammatory cranes, and to a temperature of 56°C up to 30 minutes, or then to 75% ethol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, acids, chlorophorms, and other fit bacteria, but chlorocydine can not effectively disactivate this virus.
In general, the entire human population has a loss of strength of defense for SARS-CoV-2 and therefore it is the hunt of the virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been about the defensive reaction of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer past studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS- CoV and MERS- CoV (Figure 4.4).
Generally, when a virus is attacked on a representative, the defensive system of that representative is communicated through the first-part receptors (PRRs), which include the C-part lithium-signal receptors (TLRs), the NAD-signal receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I-signal receptors (RLRs).
Through various ways, the viral inflammation factors, the cooking of the dendritic cells, and the combination of the number I section of the intra-phiron (IFNs), which restricts the reproduction of the virus and increases the strength of its viral antigenates to accelerate the microfigophocytosis.
However, SARS-CoV’s N milk virus can help protect against defensive reactions.
Soon, the agreed defence will be included in the fight against the reactive virus.
In the defense of the cells, T lymphtosis +CD4 and +CD8 play key roles.
For the preparation of the virus-related special intestines, +CD4's T cells increase the resilience of B cells and +CD8's T cells destroy the right-wing virus-affected cells.
T-help guards prepare pro-burning site cells to help the defensive cells.
However, CoV to T cells can prevent the effects of T cells by giving epoxy.
The hormone strength defence includes C3a and C5a and the integrated body supplements are necessary to face viral infection.
For instance, MERS-CoV is ineffective from the patient's injectable body.
On the other hand, due to the abundance in the system of strength defense, there are locally many free radicals that can damage the pests and other members, and, the worst situation, many members stop working and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is manifested from the beginning of clustering, and it is more likely to affect pregnant women.
This is common in those people who have a large number of viruses or whose defensive effects are deficient, more likely to be affected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the growth period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at an average of 14-1 days, more than 7-3 days.
However, according to a study of 1,099 cases, the average growth period is 3 days and from 0 to 24 days.
As stated above, a current study shows that the growth period on the basis of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very necessary for health officials to take the effective time of the coronavirus on the basis of the extreme growth periods so that people who are affected but have no signs in them can be saved from the virus’s transmission.
In general, people who have an infection or are affected by it should be carried out for 14 days.
Do you need to extend the time to 24 days?
Most COVID-19 contains important and primary signs of steam, with which there are no other signs or other signs such as, drought, breathing difficulties, pain in the lungs, diabetes, headache, scratch in the neck, swelling, pain in the chest, swelling, stomach and fatigue.
Some patients may have a week after the start of the disease to cause breathing and/or breathing quality.
In severe cases, severe respiratory syndromes, cyptic disorders, metabolic thizabitis, and freezing occur immediately in patients.
Symptoms of steam and/or breathing and severe steam, even with an unusual polmonary mixture, are required for the initial diagnosis of patients.
A population study at the end of December 2019 found that 8% of patients with 98% steam, 76% dirt, 55% breathing and 3% stroke symptoms needed ventilation assistance.
In these two case studies, a similar result was found on the cause of a disease by means of transmission from a female and non-symptomatic person.
In contrast, a 2012 study suggests that MERS-CoV patients also found basic signs of steam (%98) and dry discomfort (%47) and breathing discomfort (%55).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation assistance, COVID-19 patients were much higher than COVID-19 patients, and MERS was more sensitive than COVID-19.
In MERS patients, it was also observed sickness (26%) and inflammation (21%).
It has been demonstrated that SARS patients have symptoms of steam (100-99 percent), drought (75-29 percent), discomfort (42-40 percent), spine (25-20 percent) and inflammation (25-13 percent), and 20-14 percent of patients need help with ventilation.
By February 14, when the number of certified cases at the global level reached 66.576 in COVID-19, the number of deaths described was 2%.
In contrast, in 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS until November 2002, the indicated death rate was 10%.
On the basis of a population study in June 2012, MERS’s 2,494 certified cases described deaths by 37 percent.
A previous study found that the production of SARS-CoV-2’s R0 was increased by 5.71-7.23 to 6.47 with 95% confidence break (CI), while the production limit of SARS-CoV’s R0 was only 2 to 4.
This table 1.1 contains a balance of SARS-CoV-2's SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV's signs, description and production numbers.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher capacity of spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less vulnerable than both subsequent viruses.
So getting SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult than getting MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Most of the warfare begins with the same ship or the same gathering or the same ship.
Most patients have a history of travel or residence, or contact with the affected persons or patients within two weeks before the start of this period.
However, it has been that people can keep the virus within themselves for two weeks without the signs appearing, and the patient who is recovering from the hospital can again be hunted by the virus, which is a time for the expansion of the cardinal time.
These patients have lower or equal white blood cells on the initial level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells in < 4×109/L in which the number of lymphocytes is < 1×109/L, and the number of sprit amino transfrites and viruses in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of migraine and migraine in the liver and legs, and most patients had increased levels of C- inactive milk and etherosite in the blood.
In severe cases, the blood-income D-domer, the amount of fat, increased, and the number of lymphic sites decreased.
In COVID-19 patients' sinus radio graphics, in unusual characteristics, two sides of the bacteria are displayed on complex clay or ground glass.
The majority of patients have a common symptom, severe pain in the palm, severe respiratory disorder (ARDS).
In breathing, the sensitivity of the sinus, the incapacity of burning, the amount of liquid and the increasing amount of fiber gas in exchange are greatly understood.
The inactivity of the type I and type II neumotates reduces the level of the headache and increases the level intake, thus reducing the risk of the spread and failure of the bacteria.
Therefore, the results of the worst sinus radiography are extremely consistent with the disease.
On 18 February, 2020, SARS and MERS patients and in accordance with ARDS and viral infection pathology in the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 caused this disease in the patient's bacteria, the formation of neumocytes, hyelin bacteria, and middle lymphocytes, and multi-creative cystolic cells appeared.
For the diagnosis of COVID-19, the main criterion is the use of the Rh-Transcript Polymers China Reaction (RT-PCR) for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA pathogenesis.
On 13 February 2020 in China, medical numbers were started to be used for diagnosis (which is now not completely exclusive to RT-PCR due to more description of negative faults, which could accelerate the virus).
The diagnosis of SARS was the same.
Therefore, for effective diagnosis, in the history of the disease, medical descriptions, liberty subjects, and radiological results are necessary.
On February 14, 2020, the Fing Zhang Group issued a protocol on the use of CRISPR-based shrinking technology for the SARS-CoV-2 patch line, which would use the patch line in the patch line of the artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA pieces from 20x10-18 microliter/liter to 200x10-18 microliter/liter (for the patch 100-10 copies per microliter) for the widespread patch line in less than an hour without the need of machines.
I hope that if the medical samples are confirmed, the new technology will increase the sensitivity and facility to a dramatic level.
Due to the amount of experience with Nool CoV, the therapist can primarily provide assistant care to COVID-19 patients, while the various therapists are also trying to prescribe or use for treatment in other CoVs such as SARS- CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table(Table2)).
These methods of treatment include current and possibly in-viral medications, amino sprites, steroids, healthy patients plasma, Chinese medications and psychological assistance.
Plasma is also recommended for patients to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are engaged in the process of preparing anti-virus and vaccines.
In the projects, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the bacteria, and in a small amount other organs that exhibit ACE2, such as the mines and circles.
Breastfeeding, respiratory failure and the failure of the bacteria are the greatest risk for the sick and the greatest cause of death.
Therefore, to help in breathing to end the symptoms and save lives, the severity of the disease includes general oxygen, acute flow oxygen, non-interference ventilation and microinterference ventilation.
Patients with severe respiratory disorders have been helped by the use of the recovered cardiac polmonary pass technique for treatment in the risk of failure in John Lia's heart cycle or respiratory failure through the ECMO.
Furthermore, for the observation of the electrolight, secondary infection and cyptic trauma treatment and prevention are necessary for the preservation of the effects of the key organs in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is said that SARS and MERS patients are caused by an increase in defence system.
Sito-Object Stroma is a part of a regular burning reaction that occurs from a serial performance of Sito-Object including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
A large number of free radicals that are a major cause of severe trouble in the respiratory system and failure of various organs, these sites include the defence cells to release.
Immunosuppression is essential for treatment, especially in severe patients.
For the treatment of Satoshi cyanic stroke, Cortico Steroid Indes and To Cisizomabike Inti IL6 Molecular Inti Bodies were used.
The other defences of Satoshi cyanestromes in the treatment of defenses; IFN-y,IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was blocked; Moving Canyon's Canyon 4; and HADC was blocked, the defence reaction's T flows' guided repair included.
In SARS, steroids are used in large amounts as an amino spray to reduce the severity of burning loss.
However, in patients with SARS and COVID-19, steroid-filled foods were not beneficial in lung disease.
Instead, it can cause severe symptomatic effects, especially affecting the diagnosis of avascular osteonecrosis in the dramatic scale.
Despite this, severe patients with COVID-19 were prescribed to use with caution the short course of multiple foods of corticosteroids.
Unfortunately, no effective treatment has yet been confirmed.
However, a carrier of COVID-19 with a U.S. patient's ventricular tissue remitisure, Newclio Todd found this log effective.
Remitsoir is a null-in-viral drug, initially prepared by Gilide for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, Remitsure was blocked as possible for the prevention of MERS and SARS, including RNA viruses.
Based on it, Gilead provided a combination of it to China for a pair of tests on people affected by SARS-CoV-2, the results of which were much higher than expected.
Additionally, patients with severe respiratory disorders were prescribed for possible treatment with Barisitinb, Interferon-a, Lupinavir/Ritonavir, and Rebavir.
In the case of treatment with lupinavirus/retonavirus, it may show ulcer, stomach, liver failure and other negative reactions.
The patient should be careful with other medications that are used in this treatment.
Healthy Patients and Plasma from the Inti-body Generation
It is a long date of blood collection from patients who are healed from this disease to treat other patients with this disease or to protect healthy people from this disease.
In fact, the blood of most healthier patients has a relatively greater amount of antibodies compared to Pythogen.
Intibadi is an amyoglobin (Ig) that helps to fight potato genes and other external things through B lemon fats and to recognize the individual owners of potatoes and to eliminate them.
Based on it, COVID- 19 was admitted to 10 severe patients by collecting plasma from the blood of the healed patients.
Their symptoms, such as burning and viral arthritis, and the amount of oxygen in the blood increases within 24 hours.
However, the specific method of treatment has not yet been prepared, so it is necessary to confirm and clarify it before prescribing it on a large scale.
In addition, while seeing the effects of the treatment, some disadvantages derived from plasma should also be considered.
For example, the anti-body defence reactions are increased, and the site can cause the performance symptoms, which are likely to cause John Lia.
In general, the number of antibodies in the blood is less, and the amount of plasma for the treatment of severe patients is higher.
It is difficult to prepare a special body so quickly to fight against the world.
Removing B cells from healthy patients and screening the genetic code for effective anti-aging encoding is a thin and difficult procedure.
This way we can accelerate the work of the body.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, the exclusion of its effects depends on the combination of multiple components in a formula on a large scale, which is unique in the diagnosis of a disease on the basis of the traditional Chinese medicine theories.
Many of the effective components are unknown or mixed because such components or their best sets are difficult to identify and verify.
Currently, due to the amount of effective and special treatment of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important mutual treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have become healthier from severe stages.
For example, for the treatment of COVID-19, Jo Feng Lu Capsule and Li Hong Cheng Wine Capsule were proven to be used.
In many provinces of China, COVID-19 patients, including Gansu, (63.7 percent) ninja (50 percent) and Hanan (50 percent), have seen a lot of high indications in the treatment of 87 percent of their patients using traditional Chinese medicine, while the Hubei province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30 percent of their COVID-19 patients, has seen the least indications of healing (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly difficult balance, as the effects of this decomposition should include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Bolly Zheng and his colleagues published a study on the balance of the treatment of the Moroccan medicine (WM) with Moroccan medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that only the group of Moroccan medicines compared to the group of Moroccan medicines + traditional Chinese medicines, the physical temperature conditions, the end of the signs, and the duration of staying in the hospital, less than usual.
Extremely affectedly, the symptomatically increased sign (one to severe) compared to the WM+TCM group was only low in the WM group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the death rate (8.8% compared to 39%) was unusually low.
Unfortunately, traditional Chinese medicine is still expecting better and more controlled tests of its functionality and protection at large scales and more centers.
It would be interesting to represent the method of treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, to explain its effective components or, if possible, to clarify its combinations.
COVID-19 suspected or certified patients are more extreme and even fears of malaria, and cardiovascular people are more likely to suffer from burn, depression and anguish.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection, such as steam, clots, and discomfort, along with cardiac steroids, can cause negative effects of treatment such as insomnia, more insomnia and sensitive consumption.
In the early stages of SARS, in a series of psychiatric patients, independent intellectual disorder, anxiety, abortion, psychiatric disorder, psychiatric signs, depression and suicide is a national information.
COVID-19 is a part of the health community that can make people more indifferent and criminalised about the effects of conflicts, contracts and physical illness on their relatives and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people who live in contact with them, as well as general people who are also required to provide mental health care.
The emergence of multi-official mental health teams in medical assistance, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its treatment plans, and the use of advanced electrical machinery and appliances to protect from close interaction with each other, should be independent and accurate with the emergence of clear communications.
It is necessary to have effective vaccines to prevent the transmission series in animals, and sensitive to the affected humans, and most of these viral treatments are necessary to prevent the infection of the infected virus.
A long-term and intense neutralization efforts against SARS have been made to prepare S-based vaccines to find defence and/or protective strength.
For the SARS, the virus that has a direct effect on the samples of animals.
However, even before the beginning of the medical study, the expectations of the vaccine in the preservation from malignant chilling patterns and animal virus infections could not be revealed.
This is because SARS had ended 17 years ago and no new case has yet been.
On the contrary, in other lines, in addition to the Middle East, where the animal virus is independently polluting areas, a series of MERS earthquakes are ongoing.
To disable the virus, the wisdom of the vaccine from the MERS with the use of DNA plasma, viral vectors, nino particles, particles such as the virus and recycled meat subjects has been practically prepared, and some of them have been introduced to animal samples.
For non-defence persons, SARS-CoV-2 is an immediate and important task to ensure that safe and effective vaccines are available.
However, due to the need for a long-term (in the middle of 18 months) for Vixin's flow and CoVs' moving changes, this problem can be addressed by a chilling.
COVID-19 has begun to show its medical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can be healthier without any of the series of bone marrow.
However, such as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also more dependent on diseases and deaths in severe cases.
Therefore, health care agencies need to form a disease diagnostic model to prefer their services in low-income areas.
Based on the previously medical studies, the following factors may result in the diagnosis or influence of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)).
Life: Life was the most important element for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mainly applied to people aged 65-30 years, with 47.7% of 8,866 patients in the above expression study aged over 50 years.
These patients in which we are more likely to have substantial infectious complications are more likely to have an extreme need for care, and they are more likely to have no such complications (51 years instead of 66 years of average age), which lead the life to a diagnostic procedure for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, the SARS-CoV-2 proportion of women affects men more (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 patients who need extreme care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory cycles.
The most important cause of death is heart events in SARS patients.
It is national information that SARS-CoV-2 can also be infected with ACE2 positive cholengosite, which may cause hepatic disorder in COVID-19 patients.
It can be considered that life and basic illness are strongly related to each other and can interfere with each other.
Unusual results of libertacy: the level of reactivated blood C (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of burning or wounding and is prescribed as a possible detective procedure for the response to the treatment of this disease and the inevitable condition.
For the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19, the C-reactive fat level is prescribed.
Additionally, Elliotted Lactate De Hydro Gins (LDH), Sprit Aminotrasphyrus (AST), Ella Nine Aminotrasphyrus (ALT), and Cryptocurrency can also help in the forecast of results.
The expression of these compounds occurs in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and it occurs through the damage that reaches the stomach.
Then, the story of heart or liver failure is open.
Key medical signs: For the forecast of the results and complications of COVID-19, many of the radio graphics and medical signs of the brain should be considered to be combined with other symptoms.
Using steroids: As mentioned above, steroid defences are generally used to reduce the severity of combustion loss as a supportive treatment in multiple diseases.
Since large amounts of cartic steroid were used in severe SARS patients, many survivors were given avascular osteoncerosis with a lifetime disorder and insufficient standard of life.
For this reason, if necessary, COVID-19 patients should be used for a very small amount of steroid for a short period of time.
Common diet: As stated above, many patients during the COVID-19 period had to take an unusual diet due to long-term carcinom intake and observation of unrational death of close family members and co-patients.
These patients need psychological advice and long-term assistance to return from food to normal life.
According to the previous population studies, it seems that the web features of COVID-19 differ from SARS.
In addition to lapting in the respiratory nodes, SARS-CoV-2 can also be lapted in the respiratory operian nodes, and in the early stages of infection caused by other CoVs as a result of general cold or no symptoms.
Therefore, in the early stages or during the development period, the affected patient can find a large amount of the virus during daily activities, which leads to a major difficulty in obtaining this virus.
However, SARS-CoVki threshold occurs when the disease is severe, while in the early stages there is no more threshold.
This way, compared to SARS, the existing COVID-19 virus is much more severe and it is difficult to reach it.
At that time in China, the cities of Wuhan and AS Pass are running hopes and efforts to find disruptions in the transit of SARS-CoV-2 by putting the entire population in a series of curtains.
Although these measures are dramatically losing domestic living and other peoples, it has reduced the number of new patients, which indicates the slowdown of the disease.
The most welcome thing is that the end of this week will be in March and the phase of its duan swing will be in 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts do not expect this.
Paul Hunter, ITAL, has estimated that the COVID-19 that is more common than SARS will not end in 2020.
IRA LONGI ITAL, established a model for predicting the results of the World Health Organization that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A group from Kenya that two weeks ago, patients who were recovered from the hospital had been told by medical therapies and medical clinics that they were affected by SARS-CoV-2, which revealed that the newly-recognized virus could reduce the circulation of the flu.
However, on the basis of the number of new cases, there are hopeful signs in China, which indicate that existing wisdom is working practically.
A million cases were predicted with half a million deaths in Ebola.
However, through severe curtains and tenderness, the end of this disease has been covered.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will also be disadvantaged in the spread of the affected disease and will eventually end up or remain present with humans like a low-infected virus.
The following form is balanced with COVID-19's SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted through the direct contact of the virus-infected substance.
This virus is also found in the infection, which makes it possible to move from the infection to the brain.
According to a study conducted in 138 cases, 41 percent of cases were likely to be caused by non-neurological infection, including 17 patients and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, household persons, companions and even those who live in contact with sick or affected persons, should be very careful.
To reduce the risk of infection, the first cluster of defense is to wear a mask on the face; the use of both the circular mask and the N95 respiratory mask (Series # 1860s) helps to capture the viral transmission.
The surgical mask may lead to a person from the affected person to travel through the liquid bonds or to be attached to the levels of the objects, from where they can reach others.
However, only the N95 (Crill #1860) mask can prevent it from being included in the breath of small viral atoms from 10 to 80 nm,the exchange of 5 percent viral atoms can be completely inside,SARS-CoV-2 size is the same as SARS-CoV, both approximately 85 nm.
Though five surgical masks are also active, this particle can also be embedded in them, so patients should wear N95 (serial #1860s) masks that are directly linked to the patient, rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, those who do not keep health should wear an elderly cabbage to reduce the contact with the virus.
The virus can affect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was affected by SARS-CoV-2, while he was wearing the N95 mask; frequently the virus went through the burned eyes.
Thus, those who are careful of health should wear clear clothes on the face or eyes when working with the sick.
It is highly advisable for the people of the affected or possibly affected areas that they wash their hands more times than usual than most of the infected areas, attempt to curb themselves inside the house and restrict the contact with the potentially affected people.
The patient is expected to have a proper distance of three feet.
This effect reduces the risk of infection and is an effective way to prevent the viral transmission.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the highest sex of SARS-CoV according to a report released on 7 January 2020, and in 2003 it should be the cause of high rates for China on the foundation of SARS spread memory.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Directorate of the Center for Prevention of Wuhan’s Disease told citizens that the virus has a low number and limited production capacity in humans and that the prevention of the disease and its capacity are no problem.
From this message to the people’s arms, especially when they were doing the streams, they seemed quietly, and lost time to address this illness at a minimum of time in the waves.
The agencies that are responsible for diseases in China may have seen a lot of important in the future to get this problem ahead.
For example, these agencies should (1) be cautious when making public announcements as each word is important for citizens and can change their dreams and decisions; (2) doctors or employees are sensitive and can react to the usual information of the clinic instead of reviewing the official reports; (3) prevent access to it in the early stages rather than facilitating the public; and (4) increase public awareness of web diseases and, in time, use objectives and influencers to promote and promote the system of public reaction.
The COVID-19 virus began in December 2019 through the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In less than two months, it spread to 50 other countries across China and the world.
Because the virus is contaminated with SARS-CoV and the signs between COVID-19 and SARS are also contaminated, so the spread of COVID-19 found the feeling of the repeated spread of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the maintenance and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more men than adolescents and more women than adults, and increases the severity and description of deaths among adolescents.
In comparison with COVID-19, the description of SARS is higher (%10.91 in comparison with%1.44) .
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they don’t have any symptoms, while SARS patients have such symptoms when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to prevent COVID-19 in contrast to SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have a normal RNA negative for SARS-CoV-2.
In the second case, the virus may be positive again in healthy patients.
These results increase the disruption of the virus in the dramatic scale.
Forecast of rapid progress in COVID-19 research, many major issues are still solved, as follows:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although SARS-CoV-2 and two-bit SARS-proof CoV are 96 percent of the genes we have been traced, yet we can’t get the result that SARS-CoV-2 comes from the cells.
Who was the average transmission of the virus in man?
Without answering # 1 and 2, we can’t reduce the transitional action to the efficiency and it can repeat it at any time.
Although salmonary modeling and substance of vital chemicals indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from ACE2, how does this virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and how does it result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also spread from the cells that exhibit ACE2 in other organs?
Without the correct answers to these questions, we did not find a quick and correct diagnosis and effective treatment result.
How long will it last?
How is the virus genetically prepared for transition in humans?
Will it be a worldwide wave, will it end like SARS, or will it be a time like time?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to try to answer the above and some other questions.
However, it is also a dismissal that we have no choice but to stop it soon and return our life to the usual.
The human corona virus is the animal.
For thousands of years, changes and agreements have advanced the immense improvement of the corona viruses (CoVs) and their host animals, including humans.
Before 2003, two human crown viruses (HCoVs) were sent to general colds, such as cholesterol.
The severe respiratory disorder system (SARS) and the Eastern Central respiratory system (MERS) have suggested to show how disturbing and dangerous HCoV infection can be for life.
At the end of 2019, the fall of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China once again represented CoVs and a little bit in its faster transfer and phytogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
HCoV infection is an infection that is transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand HCoV’s animal nature.
The majority of HCoVs originally came from the bacteria where it is non-phetogenic.
Some HCoVs storage medium hosts are also known.
Identify the host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Examination of the CoV-host animal in animals results in an important insight about the Pythagines CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a review of the existing science about seven HCoVs, in which we focus on the transmission of their animals and mixed species with the date of their receipt.
The important thing is that, we balance and score different HCoVs from the point of view of the improvement of different viruses and their genetic status.
In the same context, there was a discussion of the existing CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) below.
In addition, the successful host animal changes demand and the severity of the disease has been shown to protect against the virus.
The coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of file, positive senses, one-called RNA viruses.
The RNA viruses that used large genes such as 26 to 32 kBs, the viruses were called "CoV" due to the appearance of the Crown Jesse Morphology from the Electronic Micro Scope.
Structually,CoVs are non-divided genes that participate in a JC setting.
Approximately two genes include two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the role of pp1a and pp1ab.
This currency meat produces more than 16 non-structured meat, nominated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genes include ORFs for structural meat, including nickdar(S), file(E), clay (M) and new clay meat (N).
A large number of special series supporters are also encoded through CoVs of different series.
Based on the differences in silk arrangements, CoVs are ranked in four generations (Alfa-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gama-CoV and Delta-CoV), in which Beta-CoV generations include most HCoVs and are divided into more series (A, B, C and D).
The evidence of the phylogenic genes revealed that the majority of grapes and sheep are the source of the genes of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest reserves of gamma-CoV and dieta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have passed a series of different kinds of rocks and some of them have become important human phytogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been discovered.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, Eastern Central Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 in severe and severe respiratory problems.
Generally, HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause common cold and/or sickness signs.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 are extremely phytogenic, which can cause infection of the lower portion of the respiratory canal with the increased possibility of exposure of severe respiratory disorders (RDS) and extraphlemonic descriptions in more and more patients.
In the middle of the 1960s, the use of HCoV-229E, B814, eliminated those who went out of the neck from common cold patients.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-restrictive signs.
In fact, before the spread of SARS, the idea was largely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless.
The occurring SARS in 2003 is the most disturbing event in history, in which this royal disease affected more than 8,000 people with 10% of deaths.
Ten years later, as a result of the spread of the respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East, the island is independently spread to the whole world.
November 2019 (HCoV (2019-nCoV), later referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) research agency, which caused more than 3,120 lives by March 3, 2020 and more than 91,000 people affected by it.
The world is coming and the world is coming with the SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are cattle, sheep or cattle.
Multiple proof lines confirm that the improvement of all HCoVs is from the primary stages, where the virus is well-acceptable and expresses non-phetic gins but high genetic diversity.
COVID-19 has delivered countless medical, psychological, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
HCoVs provides a framework to understand the legendary power history, the power of spread and the factors of transmission resistance in various kinds.
This could also help or help in attempting to host SARA-CoV-2 reserves, medium and breeding animals with key ingredients in the future to prevent it from being repeated.
In this review, we will present a review of animal, mixed species and HCoVs.
Specifically, we reject this common idea and exchange the idea that HCoVs' father virus generally becomes non-phetogenic in their power reserve host animals and becomes phetogenic after transition into their new host animals.
We also take the assessment of the HCoVs’ upgrades, in which the majority of the pits are increased in transition with a little in ginseng.
In this review, the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 disintegration were also thought to be exchanged.
CoVs of animals are known since the late 1930s.
The dose of HCoV-229E B814 was first modeled, before the outgoing substance of the neck of ordinary cold patients, different CoVs influenced animals including turkey, sheep, cattle, cattle, bees and cats.
In the subsequent decades, seven HCoVs were recognized.
The short summary of the date of receipt of HCoVs (Table 1) according to the historical order shall be informed and taught.
In 1966, HCoV-229E was developed before breathing in patients with respiratory opernal infection, and was subsequently developed to grow in the wire lines of the WI-38.
In 10 to 20 percent of cases of patients affected by HCoV-229E, common colds included headaches, swelling, discomfort and symptoms of flower burning with steam and discomfort.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the body culture and then placed in the serum right of the kidneys' brain.
The medical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection are observed by those who have HCoV-229E, which are not symptomatically different from the phytogenes of other respiratory tract, such as the influenza A virus and the Rhino virus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are divided worldwide, and this season spreads more in moderate weather during the cold.
Generally, the growth time of both viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to a satisfactory study of humans, a healthy person affected by HCoV-229E usually has 30 colds.
In patients who understand only a few strengths of defense, a severe infection of the lower part of the respiratory tract occurs.
SARS, also referred to as "one general sample", was first well documented as a global virus due to HCoV in human history and SARS-CoV is an ethological agent, which has been tested for HCoV.
The first SARS case could be relocated at the end of 2002 in China's province of Zhuang Dong.
The SARS virus spread to many countries and provinces resulted in 8.096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, in which the growth period is 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of the disease is at the level of viral inflammation and it can increase almost two seconds of the case.
Patients affected by SARS-CoV initially have symptoms of pain, headache, vomiting, anxiety and colds in the legs, followed by symptoms of late appearance of stress, discomfort, and breathing problems.
Limousine, an unusual liberty test of SARS, is common to have an irregular function of the liver and some high-cryptin cancer.
Patients with SARS are also advised to have a prevalent loss of the urine, the epithelial cells and the supplement of microfysics.
After that, about 20 to 30 percent of the patients were not extreme and needed micro-ventilation.
In these severe cases, many organs, in addition to the narcotic respiratory disorder, including the intestinal disorder, the liver and the pulver, may be affected, generally, by cyto-organic estromes, which may be infected especially in low-power defensive patients.
For the first time, the virus was eliminated from the biopsy of the open spots of the indice patient's relatives, who had traveled from Zhuang Zhu to Hong Kong.
The investigation of HCoV has been stopped.
In the late 2004 period, HCov-NL63 was separated from a 7-month baby in Niderland.
Initially, this occurs with respiratory disease in young children, adults and low-power defensive patients.
In the disease caused by HCoV-BL63, the inflammation of the necklace, the inflammation of the eye, the steam and the necklace.
In a free study, a 8-month Niderland sample demonstrated that the same virus was eliminated from the infected boy's neck sample.
Although its recognition occurred in the Netherlands, it was actually divided on a global level.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is about 4.7% in the general respiratory disease, and its symptoms are severe in the beginning of seasonal heat, seasonal flow and seasonal cold.
HCoV-NL63 is derived from the rocate-blowing cancy, which is also known by the name of the crap.
In the same year, a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized due to the burning of the shell of the shell, HCoV-HKU1 was removed from Hong Kong.
The sample obtained from the community and with burning in the nursery, the HCoV-HKU1 was with severe pressure problems.
Likewise, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which contains respiratory disease, have been found worldwide.
These HCoVs derived from the four communities are much better than humans, and generally they are very little likely to alter the discovery of extreme phytogenic disease, although the incidents have become known on the basis of unknown evidence, as the more severe subdivision of HCoV-NL63 has been in China as a rare case that causes severe infection in the respiratory canal.
Generally, when it gets the power to be transmitted to HCoV and to keep itself continuous within humans, it becomes low-intensity harmful or low-intensity ginseng.
MERS-CoV was for the first time triggered in 2012 from a 60-year-old sick puppy in Saudi Arabia who was the hunt of severe patterns and coronary dysfunction.
Where more accredited cases of liberty occur in the Middle East, and sometimes in close relationships with secondary divisions, income cases occur in the European countries and in Tunisia.
In 2015 a secondary visa was made with 186 certified cases in South Korea.
MERS’s medical description of SARS, which has the characteristics of developed severe samples, is popular.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have severe circle failure, which is very isolated from MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30 per cent of patients have symptoms of the intestine, such as swelling and fatigue.
By 14 February 2020, 34.4% of more than 2500 cases certified by Liberty died, making MERS-CoV one of the extremely destructive viruses that occur in humans.
During the last period from the middle of December 2019, the previously Chinese province of Hubei, Wuhan, a large number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection-dependent symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that SARS-CoV-2 is a public health condition, and that the disease is called COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, of which 3.4% of those treated have died.
Specifically, in Hubei, China, the death rate of these cases is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory inflammation and is promoted in the form of steam, anxiety and anxiety.
Some patients have also been diagnosed.
It is one of the most severe symptoms and it can add to severe respiratory symptoms.
Although 82% of the high neoclium thyroids fall into SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as a result of a series similarity, it is a gene of the various corners of the phytogenic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 virus is less phytogenic but more transmitted compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 signs of non-symptomatic subjects affected that could take part in its rapid development worldwide.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in balance and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First, HCoVs disease is very similar in the period and period of development.
In this series, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 signs is between SARS-CoV and the other four resulting from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63)
On the one hand, it has generally been observed that HCoVs derived from the SARS-CoV-2 community during the infection period, including non-specific, false or without any signs, show the characteristics of their infection.
On the other hand, a small set of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as a SARS-CoV infection, while this proportion is slightly low.
TESRA shows interesting features such as HCoVs and SARS-CoVs derived from the SARS-CoV-2 transmission community.
On the one hand, the lowest transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is more than that of HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after entering humans decreases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be tried in remedial samples.
Although in less than a few cases which remains to be clear in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 speaks an important role in the translation of sperm as the SARS-CoV case.
This view will also be especially interesting whether SARS-CoV-2 as HCoVs obtained from the community will also appear periodically.
Nevertheless, the properties of SARS-CoV-2 after entering humans, including transmitted, phytogenic and stable plants, will affect the continuous treatment of COVID-19.
Characteristics obtained from the community by well-accepting in humans cause HCoVs illicit signs.
From the other point of view, it may also be true that humans have well agreed with these four HCoVs.
In other words, both parts can be deprived of the old HCoVs worldwide.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who are hunted for severe HCoV diseases have ended.
To do so, it is necessary to transfer HCoVs to humans to meet the preservation of the host animal to a sufficient extent and to gather the change according to the source.
In this regard, as long as the SARS-CoV-2 lump extends and affects more people, it is only possible that humans fully take it.
If it is taken in the right way, then it is difficult to prevent its transition in humans by means of other measures that prevent the coronation or infection.
For several years, four CoVs obtained from the community have been circulating in the township, resulting in general colds among the defenders under discussion.
These viruses do not require animal reserves.
On the contrary, people from the extreme pitch gynects SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not agree well and could not maintain their transfer in humans.
They need to grow in their animals' reserves and increase in them, and possibly try to spread into sensitive human targets by means of one or more medium and widespread host animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs JC properties derived from the community.
Less than that time, it has more authority to be transferred as HCoVs derived from the community.
However, it is more phytogenic than HCoVs derived from the community and less phytogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains yet to see if man will bring it completely to his own and it will turn into humans without any reserve or medium host animal.
Before talking about HCoVs' species, HCoVs' hosts are better to set up the species, nature, reserve, medium and wide area and talk about their features.
An animal, if he is a carrier of a close-owned generation partnership, then he shares the highest part similarity at the level of the sequence of the newly-developed, HCoVs’ upgrading acts as a host animal.
Generation virus is generally well-accepted in this host animal and is non-phetogenic.
Similarly, the host guarantees the living HCoVs continuously and long-term.
In both faces, hosts are highly influenced by life power and hosts the power of HCoV or its father virus.
On the contrary, if the HCoV is made known to the average host at the time of the date or before it, then it will not better agree with the new host and the majority of them will be gink.
This medium host can act as the animal of the living human infection and then plays the role of the fast-growing host of human infection in humans.
If HCoVs does not establish the transfer within the medium host, then it will fall into the line of infection.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also agree in the middle host and can even establish a long-term food.
In such a way, the medium-sized host will be the host of the reserve.
The number of viral diseases has disappointedly revealed that SARS’s index case has a history of interaction with gambling animals.
The subsequent discharge investigation revealed that SARS-CoV lgG is more contrasted in animal traders compared to the general population.
In the market of livestock, it was first recognized that there were viruses such as SARS-CoV (Pigoma Laravata) and SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV) in a ribbon cat.
It directly confirms that no one is informed of the SARS after all the products in the markets have been destroyed.
However, it has been that the masks from the forest or food were greatly negative to SARS-CoV without appearance in the animal market, resulting in the possibility that the masks from the food are only working as a wide-ranging medium-host living but this is not the power reserve of SARS-CoV.
Specifically, since 80% of different animals contain SARS-CoV’s intrinsic bodies in the jungle mines, therefore many smoking small animals of SARS-CoV may not be out of the possibility to work as a medium-host animal.
These are all the signs of SARS as hosts.
As a result of SARS-CoV’s power host animal testing, the near-owned coat CoV, known as the SARS-owned rainophysic coat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese bird’s rainophysic coat, has disrupted.
These compounds are positive for the SARS-Rh-BatCoV and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and the other bit CoV SARS-CoV are partners in 92-88% Neoclear Todd sequence similarity.
These studies have founded the foundation of this new idea that cattle are the hosts of human phytogenesis.
SARS-like multiple CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been recognized from cells, but no one except a nominated WIV1 can be identified as a living virus.
Human Angio Tinsone Converter Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called the SARS-CoV recipient.
WIV1 derived from the samples of cranberries demonstrated to be used as a recipient of cranberries, cranberries and human ACE2 internal cranberries.
Interestingly, the health of SARS is a part of the disinfection of SARS WIV1.
Until now, WIV1 is the closest representation of the SARS-CoV, which belongs to the generation of trips, which shares 95 percent of the Neo-Tood sequence similarities.
Nevertheless, despite the extreme similarity between these two viruses, it is generally confident that WIV1 is not the father of the SARS-CoV right and is not the host of the immediate reserve of the SARS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV of the same group was divided into a bit of CoV-HKU4 and a bit of CoV-HKU5, a phylogenetic.
Bit CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same representative receptor, Deppithil peptide 4 (DPP4) for the virus’s entry.
The unique RNA polymers on the MERS RNA recognized from Europe and Africa are genetically closer to our positions in the Beta-CoV.
Until now, no living MERS-CoV can be found in the forest trees.
MERS-CoV and its close-owned bit CoV-HKU25 share only 87 percent of the similarities of the Newcastle series.
Thus, the host of the MERS-CoV immediate reserve may not be alive.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East showed that in many African countries, such as the east-east century nations, MERS-CoV’s special uneffective intestines have a cutting-edge on-siro position.
MERS-CoV, similar to the viruses that occur in humans, was selected through a flame of a covetable ounce, and it further indicates that the real host of the MERS-CoV works as a reserve of animal.
It is remarkable that, experimentally, MERS-CoV-affected cells were generally diagnosed with mild signs but large-scale viral flows.
Specifically, the virus is derived from the affected ones not only from the breath, but also from the phenomenal language, which is also the fundamental truth of the viral flow from the gums.
However, the questions remain because before the start of the signs there is no date of association with the number of certified multiple cases of MERS, which includes the species of transmitted to human or unknown animals, which protect MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a partner of 96.2 percent neocliotide similarity with the RaT13 bit.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very good for providing parent relationship.
I mean, the right reserve host of Bit SARS-CoV-2 may not be alive unless in the future there will be almost similar Bit CoVs.
Often, Hunan's seafood food crop, which contains many primary cases of COVID-19 and which may indicate the side of transition from animals to humans, is the middle host of the SARS-CoV-2 species of sold and destroyed forest life.
Many based on the mitochondrial genetic sequence Current studies have prescribed that a group of small beasts that smoke from the danger that go by the name of the pinguin (Mans Javinica) may also be refugees of SARS-CoV-2-related water beans.
These nucleus pinguin CoV genes share with SARS-CoV-2 in the 85-92% similarity of the nucleus thyroid sequence.
However, it is close to the RaTG13 with approximately 90% recognition on the level of the Newcastle Tide series.
These phylogenic trees are a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, one of which is shared with 97.4 % amino acid sequential recognition, as well as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor bonding domain (RBD).
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more diverse, despite the high levels of linear similar genes.
The patient has been informed by the national authority of receipt of SARS-CoV-2 patterns in previous studies, which are similar to SARS-CoV-2 patterns.
The study found part genetic sequence, which is approximately 86.3% of the viral genes of supplementary lamp, developed various assembly methods and manual protection.
We cannot exceed the possibility that the pinguin is one of the middle host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, Currently, due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and Pinguin SARS-CoV-2's Beta CoVs, there is no evidence of support for the right SARS-CoV-2 of the Pinguin Mase.
In addition, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and Pinguin-SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Beta CoVs.
In pigs, pinguins and other smoking animals, SARS-CoV-2’s upgrading is still in place.
Meanwhile, the best series compares SARS-CoV-2 and Pinguin, SARA-CoV-2 belonging to the Beta CoVs between the receptor bonding domain, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best wider genetic series compares.
This is the ultimate comparison that, the SARS-CoV-2 and Python SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the BTA CoVs' receptor building domain through the selected third-party prudent upgrade between high-level similarities.
In the Third Forest Animals Division, a response was prescribed on the right of open combination between Pinguin SARA-CoV-2 belonging to Beta CoVs and RaTG13.
The addition of the open combination on the broad range between Beta CoVs, is available as a driving force in advancement.
SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined on the right animal cat.
In addition to the extreme phytogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied as an animal substance.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be original methyl-bit CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in the father's viruses.
It has been that a bit of CoV called ARCoV.2 (Iplachin Ridge Co) in the North American trophy showed a close connection to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with one and a bit of CoV, so-called Heposydrosis/Ghanyanemia/19/2008, which is considered to be a medium-host living in the bacterium, even on ontons.
For the explanation, the existing science on the HCoVs' species is shortened in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Fluogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the events of transmitting mixed species of HCoVs in history.
When the HCoV-OC43 HCoV-OC43, which passed the 1890s, broke the species to affect humans, was the worldwide record of respiratory infection.
The history of HCoV-229E’s mixed species is less clear.
It has been found close association with HCoV-229E of the beta-fa-CoVs.
Among them there is an Elfa CoV.
Many evidence confirm the transmission of the virus to humans from the right legs.
First, in the common revolution, it can be the contact of humans from the clusters, not the clusters.
Instead, it belongs closely to the people’s alphabet.
Secondly, the HCoV-229E belonging bites of Elfa CoVs are diverse and non-phytogenic in the bites, while Elfa CoV is caused by the spread of respiratory diseases in the affected animals.
In the end, Elpa Elva CoV didn’t come into the pants.
Thus, it cannot be exhausted the possibility that alpha HCoV-229E belongs to Elfa CoV from humans.
In fact, human phytogenic viruses, including reverse viruses, Ebola viruses, viruses and Hendra viruses, are the right source.
So it’s not surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted to the right human.
In exchange, where the Beta Elva CoVs work as a HCoV-229E genetic tuberculosis, there the alpha and ontoons can work as a medium representative, such as the MERS-CoV case, which transmits viruses to humans.
MERS-CoV works as the best example of transportation of mixed species to humans from a cabbage ontoons and ontoons.
The MERS-CoV upgrading measure is known as its initial recognition and is also popular by the subsequent results.
It appears that the genetic components provide a full range of viruses for the transfer and exchange of divisions between divisions and between divisions.
Lumbie life, Ganjanabad colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to travel, are suitable to build an example of 'wears spreading' for the crowds.
On the other hand, from several decades, MERS-CoV is becoming familiar in a mountain.
It was well agreed in those who turned the right host from the strong and powerful reserve host to the right host.
MERS-CoVins very sensitive diseases and relatively low description changes in these animals.
It is sometimes a transitional incident in humans and humans are the hosts of the MERS-CoV band because it cannot maintain its transition.
Contrary to the role of the units in the MERS-CoV transfer, in the SARS-CoV-2 transfer, the role of the pinguin, if any, is different.
In particular, Pinguin Beta-CoVs are extremely phytogenic in Pinguin.
It may be that they are a line-up host for SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV that is caused by sorts in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or recover multiple possibilities of transmitting mixed species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First of all, the SARS-CoV-2 may be a source of host animal like SARS-CoV-2 that is almost similar to the virus.
Thus, the human beings, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth, or the people of the earth.
Secondly, the pinguin may be one of the faster medium-host animals, in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus was newly known.
The human beings are able to get closer to the virus by playing and hunting foods.
It is possible to hunt multiple smoking animals including domestic animals SARS-CoV-2.
There is a guarantee for the housing and forest animals.
TESRA, as stated above, SARS-CoV-2 may be found in the open combination and consensus of the type of TESRA that connects both the gums and the pinguins.
The SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the host animals of different sections, CoVs are important in providing the facility of three major factors by the wire in passing through several sections.
In the RNA transfer, they describe relatively more changes.
In contrast to the second-equated RNA viruses, the description of the determined change of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "middle" while the description of the average exchange of each year on each site 2 is based on the status of 10-4 exchange, excluding on the stage of the agreement of the CoV of the host animals.
CoVs have pro-riding external bonds, the result of which removal is better variable, the attention is even unconsumable.
Interestingly, the New Clyde Tide Inalag Remediator is known to interfere with the transfer of CoVs through the exclusive RNA polymers to the external bronchitis and RNA.
Remedial medical practice is an extremely intelligent agent that can be used as a counteract SARA-CoV-2.
Unfortunately, the description of the change of CoVs is one million times more compared to its host animals.
In addition, the majority of times when CoVs hosts can’t agree well in life, there’s more description of the change.
Balance the description of the highest variation of SARS-CoV, you are less described by the variation in SARA-CoV-2 that is well-accepted in most humans.
Often, this has already been agreed in a near-human and host animal.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV is logged on which it is well agreed in a coupling volume.
Theoretically, it is not possible that increased genes immediately disable viruses and anti-viruses against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the genes present in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional resilience in genetic repair for alternative and open combinations in large RNAs, thus increasing the probability of substantial improvement of mixed species, which is beneficial for the appearance of nucleus CoVs when the circumstances are appropriate.
Its confirmation is made by the help of the coding of multiple single reading frameworks and the effects of the 3' ends of the genes.
Thesra, through the single mechanism of "copy choice", most CoVs disruptly switch into the RNA sandwiches.
During the transition of CoV RNA, in the host living, which works as a mixture, the pain changes frequently.
For the preparation of new CoVs, the complementary lamp and subgenital RNAs of the extreme homologue can be re-open combination.
The proof of phylogenic power mix was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as Bit SL-CoV and Bit CoV-HKU9.
Communications of the hosts of the virus in the transmission series
In addition to the three factors of the above viral, the host is an important element in the viral interaction effect and mixed species transfer.
With this, the open combination of SARS-CoV is taken as an annual example, which indicated the positive choice of the mixed species during the transitional period.
In addition to the interactive detection of humans and cattle’s SARS-CoVs, the idea of SARS-CoV’s rapidly detection in various host animals, especially with the change in the S-Lay Receptor Binding Domain.
Generally, in the CoV's S coal, the receptors interact with the binary domain receptors and are severely selected by the host body reaction.
In SARS-CoV, S1 has a 318th to 510th receptor bonding domain, which is also the human ACE2 body of its corseptors for viral intrinsic.
SARS-CoV's receptors are recognizable ACE2 receptors for the binding domain that allow the transmission of the mixed species of the virus to various animals, including cattle, cattle, cattle and reacon cattle.
In fact, the remains of only 6 amino acids in the receptor binding domain were found differently in humans and sewells, of which 4 are found in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The seat SARS-CoV's receptor bination domain has K479N and S487T changes, which can increase the interaction of the supplier with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can be an important substance for the agreement of the viral in man.
It is noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov in S1 units indicates that the human ACE2 is likely to convert the essential dependence of S.
Without a doubt, a study of a cooling electrical nutrient indicates that this dependency is 10 to -20 times greater than the dependency between the human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether any other subsequent receptor will be needed for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 or not.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also collapsed from ACE2 but with different parts of S.
Here there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E amino peptides N, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for their successful agreement of CoVs after the transfer of mixed species from their host animals to humans.
In addition to bacterial receptors, the concern of the result of the HCoV mixed species is produced by one-and-hospitalizing and stable factors.
The power of humans and HCoVs stored host animals, such as cattle, a mountainous ounce and cattle between these host meat mixed species can be recovered in the transit.
A successful mixed species in HCoVs are angry host animal exclusion factors and disturbing host animal stability factors.
In this series, the host of the virus remains to identify this important part of the interaction with the animal and to determine the health of the properties.
The exclusion of the host animal and the non-sufficient wide genetic boundary of the factors for SARS-CoV-2 can be beneficial with the use of the latest technology of CRISPR.
Novel HCoVs Dismissal: Go Back to Zero Ground
The variety of Bit CoV provides enough places for the expulsion of HCoVs.
In this regard, Bit CoVs acts as a HCoVs genetic substance.
In addition, the rapid change and genetic open combination also increases the improvement of HCoVs and works as two key steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the nucleus alloy coding gene, the ability to quickly convert the viral fino type.
In SARS-CoV's long-lasting milk, ORF8 is considered important in human consent, as the SARS-CoV-related bacterial viruses were modeled but it has a variety of national encodes of ORF8 milk.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, the pattern of the SARS-CoV’s 29 neocliotide ends.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and it is an agreed change that promotes the transfer to hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of re-open combination with the series of ILFA and GAMA-CoVs, where the unique RNA polymers on the RNA have been recognized in large numbers of re-open combination small areas.
The recognition of the reintegration authorities was made in some parts of nsp9, more nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been seen that MERS-CoV WBA, which took place in a mountainous ounce in Saudi Arabia, had to experience the events of re-open combination between different generations.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the events of re-open combination have also been seen in other CoVs, in which HCoVs are re-open combinations with other animal CoVs with their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial choice may be a partner in non-reklamancy changes in viral genes, possibly avoiding optional defects, such as the host animal’s power defense system, resulting in the rescue from the viral genes.
An example of its effects is the loss of the full lumens of ORF4 in HCoV-229 E's prototype esterins, which causes the removal of two neoclium thydes.
Although the preservation of ORF4 in HCoV-229E-related viruses and onts can be suggested, a single of the Alpha-CoV shows the index of New Clyde, resulting in a frame shutdown.
Last but not less, the upgrades of the HCoVs are also made by the employer through the selected DBA in the hosts of their reserves.
When the gums are affected by CoVs, there is a sign of no signs or no signs, which indicates the mutual agreement between CoVs and the gums.
It appears to be good in anatomy and physically with CoVs.
For example, the disadvantages in activating the anti-inflammatory reaction in the gums reduce the efficiency of moving pathology through CoVs.
In addition, the power murderer in the cave stopped the entertainment of the power murderer in the cave due to the low level of exposure of the repressors of the NKG2/CD94 and the great Histo Complex of Class I.
Furthermore, the reactivation of the high level of the oxygen section (ROS) resulting from the high media bulk entertainment (ROS) both disrupts the transmission of CoVs, and to make the extreme PITHA JINK VIRUS STRINES to be influenced by pro-riding through the XURY BONCLEIS, when a new host becomes a living tradition, provides the selected debut.
Further Pythogenic CoV strines can be prepared again through an open mixture, which can increase the host to obtain the properties of noul milk or milk for the consent of the animal.
So, it doesn’t happen that three node HCoVs in the past two decades.
CoVs make their reserves hosted by signs such as non-pete jink or hollow signs in shells and shells.
They are strongly preparing the rescue of the strong hosts without a response.
In it, the secret of why no signs of illness are shown and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hypertensive activity of the defensive reaction and the sato-organic stremes in which the strong defensive reaction causes more severe damage to the footsteps.
On the contrary, in a non-signal disease taking, the defensive reaction was de-capped from the transfer of CoV.
Anti-SARA-CoV-2 treatment has a beneficial effect of the same wisdom practice that does not relate to defensive reactions.
In particular, the reaction of the interferon is strong.
Therefore, in the early stages of less SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the regulation of section I interferon should be beneficial.
In addition, the inflammatory activity of NLRP3 in the glands is disadvantaged.
Therefore, it may be beneficial to prevent NLRP3 burning with MCC950 in the treatment of COVID-19.
The expulsion of SARS-CoV-2 follows the reversible general idea through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a combination of beta CoV has been found to share the 95% New Clyde Similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a bit-CoV that shares the 96% New Clyde Similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While the seats and other animals in the menu have been found to prevent viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2's right-middle host animal cannot be recognized.
Pinguin Beta CoVs is surprisingly a result of being homologated by SARS-CoV-2, which means that Pinguin is working as one of the middle host animals or then Pinguin Beta CoVs can take part in the uncertain version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic spots.
Although questions remain yet, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was killed by humans or accidentally created.
Due to the current SARS-CoV-2 virus, CoVs came into light again.
The study of CoVs in cattle and other animals has simplified our ideas about the stocks of animals and HCoVs in human transportation.
A wide range of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are a compound and it has been transmitted to humans through a medium-host animal.
Considering that the infection of SARS-CoV is found in the mouths due to the interaction between humans and seeds, it can be effectively ended by closing the meat mouths and killing the seeds.
For this reason, in anticipation of the receipt of multiple series of pinguin beta-CoVs close to SARS-CoV-2, pinguin should be removed from the meat minerals to prevent the transmission from animals.
However, in future investigations it remains clear now that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans when and where through pinguins and other smoking animals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in a long-term mountain range.
For the local people, it also works as a major means of transportation with meat, smoke, wood and its basic means.
It is a great deal in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, some of the ones that were done in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were impossible to sacrifice all the ones to control MERS.
In order to prevent MERS' current disruption, with other measures to prevent infection, a comprehensive observation should be made to prepare effective vaccines against MERS for the ones.
Because we are not able to end these viruses, so this can be the cause of the new genetic division.
CoVs of species and species of animals are circulating in the forest.
Specifically, CoVs with talent in animals are very diverse.
As a result of the expulsion of new CoVs that are more portable and/or fragile in humans in the future, genus CoVs are many times prepared and reappeared.
In order to reduce the unnecessary relationship between humans and animals, some officials in China should abandon the culture of eating forest animals.
With the tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better performance and response plans should be on their place.
In fact, a lot of viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They will remain in their reserve until they have the time to grow.
Although cells have many characteristics that cause viruses, but if people are taught, the sites of interaction with human cells and other types of forest life can be reduced.
For a better understanding of CoV and its power hosts, it is necessary to constantly care for smoking animals, which are effective in the prevention of transmitting from these animals to humans and its future reproduction.
As a result, by keeping the power of the virus of diseases transmitting from humans to humans away from the molecular layer of reserve, the virus of diseases transmitting from humans to humans can be more effectively addressed.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing.
First of all, if the worm transmits a generation of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the pinguin, this vision will cause interest that the worm and the pinguin can share the same metabolic power in cases.
On the other hand, if the chest performs more right in the transition in man, then it should be determined how man comes into the relationship with the chest.
Thesra, if Thesra works as a true medium representative, it will explain how it interact with other species, including humans, pigs and pinguins.
Finally, because many other smoking animals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2, so their concerns and experiences should be arranged for infection.
If cattle, pinguins, or any two-threatening beings, then it is expected that in the future the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and its father-in-law viruses, which are almost the same, will be in its power representatives.
Continuing research in this field will explain the advanced travel of SARS-Cov-2 in animals with a significant impact on the prevention and capacity of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to renew the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19's "such case" and "certified case"
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Fast Advisory Guide for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection,This Guide Name provides our experience and is a good guide for fighting global infection throughout the world.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease,which is gradually increasing on the basis of the results of current research and experience of medical practice in science; therefore, the wisdom of the diagnosis and treatment practices are also being continually updated.
In this line we respond to a comment on the name of our guidelines, which has been published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, saying that COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) provides the latest diagnostic criteria for "such case" and "certified case" according to the name of the diagnosis and last guidelines for treatment.
In December 2019, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was followed, which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named Serious Difficulty in Diagnosis Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a worldwide system.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has prepared a sharp advisory guide name and it was released online on 06 February 2020 in the Melty Medical Research.
He had a lot of attention after hearing.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and science is gradually increasing in it on the basis of the results of current research and medical practice experience; therefore, the wisdom of the diagnosis and treatment practices are also being continually updated.
For example, the People's Republic of China's National Health Committee issued the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), its total seven numbers were issued from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some fundamental changes in the context and competition.
Now our guide is named Zhao Ital, a commentary from the side, he prescribed easy scanning on the basis of his medical experience.
Their work has included a new warrant for our guidance and this is a valuable reference to this worldwide worldwide.
We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to them.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the COVID-19 (Test version) and the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines of current studies.
According to the Numbers (3 March 2020), the confirmation of the alleged case requires a comprehensive analysis of a person with two objects of medical explanation of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date:
History of HIV/AIDS: (1) History of travel or residence in the city and district of Wuhan, or other communities where the cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the start of the signs; (2) History of contact with multiple cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with the positivity of the Neoclear Acid Zone); (3) History of contact with the cases of COVID-19 in the last 14 days before the start of the signs; (4) History of contact with the cases of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs of the signs.
Medical descriptions: (1) symptoms of steam and/or breath; (2) with imaginary properties of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white blood cells in the early stages indicates the number of normal, fluctuating, or low lymphatic sites.
Any of the subjects listed in the Pythogenic or Cerological Convention should be identified as a certified case on the suspected case with one: (1) to be positive of the real-time PCR branch for SARS-CoV-2; (2) to be a sequence of full viral genes that show a high concentration of known nucleus coronavirus; (3) to be positive of the specific lgM intic bands and lgG intic bands for SARS-CoV-2 in the serum branch; or to be positive of the negative of the specific lgG intic bands for SARS-CoV-2 or to be increased by ≥4 in the stage of the extreme stage of the thyroid.
We can see that the real-time PCR range for Neoclyc Acid in breathing or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) numbers.
The blood samples included Python's Penta Lega Chuthen (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) numbers; and the surological tests were included in the seventh numbers.
The research-based repair work is ongoing, with the attempt to detect more and more pathogenic cuts of neocolic acid to quickly in the certified standard, and the blood samples including respiratory nodes that increase the achievement of different samples, and assist in the achievement of positive results of specific intestinal bodies.
In addition, and there are also many evidence that remind us of precaution from patients with historical signs and without signs.
Therefore, the Jewelry Chart should work well, because they ranked a person in "low risk" without any medical signs.
The scorer system also needs to be more certified in medical exercises and studies.
As a result, we are more hoping for the coming of the right warnings and asking the readers to advance their effects.
In order to identify the "such case" and the "certified case", we advise them to read and impose the latest guidance names in their native countries.
In order to help, our team is working hard on our guidance.
There is a national report of five new deaths due to COVID-19 in Bangladesh, which is the most daily.
Last day, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the most of the deaths caused by the virus in one day.

Approximately 52,000 deaths are caused by COVID-19, a disease caused by the corona virus.
Stone Mile came the same day when Malawi confirmed his first corona virus infection and died from the first corona virus in Zimbabwe.
North Korea has claimed that it is one of the few countries that are still clean from the coronavirus infection.
In total, the World Health Administration on April 4, according to Central European Time (0800 UTC) after 10 hours of morning, including 79,332 cases, 1,051,635 certified cases.
The U.S. government has recorded more than 244,000 cases of Corona virus from 5,900 deaths in the United States.
CBS News by John Hopkins University that more than 1,000 Americans have died due to coronavirus infection until the beginning.
Worldwide, countries have announced harsh measures to prevent the spread of this disease.

In the Australian stores, the throw piper limit was reduced in every line religion.
During the weekly and weekly days, the Australian stores’ chains, Wal Worth and Queels, reduced the prohibitions of the purchase of household vacancy pipes in all stores on the national level to two and one points on each line.
ALDI made the day of the old, a pic limit.
These boundaries were posted in check-outs, and messages on the Facebook pages of the chains.
COVID-19 was the national report of the buyers to store it in the event of the need for people's self-built unrest due to fear.
At first, Wool Worth also limited the purchase of the house vacuum to a pic on each order.
These changes will follow the four-pick settlements on each line that was established by the previous traditions of Wall Worth and Queens on 4 and 5 March in a row.
Queels, on March 8 in the Media Release, that with the four-pick stops on the same place, "many stores are still being sold within an hour of delivery," and that manga was placed as a "example", while ALDI called it "unpredictable" on a post on Facebook.
According to Wolverine's translator, last week's sales were "augmented".
Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal Coastal
In order to reduce the claim, Queels ordered big points from the shipping providers and added to the sequence of the shipping, Wool Worth ordered additional reserves, while ADLI reserved for the private initial achievement of the plan's day.
The executive director of the Australian Food Sales Association, Russell Zimmermin, said that food sales are trying to increase its reserves, but the local council’s fixation at the time of the trail made it difficult.
They have increased creation leagues in addition, because they are trying to meet the calling manga and do something special.
To Mangel, ALDI announced that after the storage cuts, some special stores did not go to the start.
Coinland University of Technology's food expert Dr. Martimer said in a report on News.com.au that the stores were stored daily at night.
He said that the house empty piper is a great thing, which causes it to have a small amount of storage, and when it is sold, it leaves the widespread space of the shelf empty, which makes it feel hard.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the ABC News, “The reward of Coels and Wall Worth is [that] if there are many things on the shelf, if the house vacancies and the synthesizers can be made [buy] and if it is in the amount, then you may be able to reduce the Hobrahat.”
A crypting re cyclicated house empty paper maker told the previous start that they will be without reserves.
According to News.com.au’s report, Cambridge Clark, who builds the clines house vacancies, and Solars who builds the Surbint, forcefully said that they’re working 24/7 to maintain the vacancies.
Domain.com, a site for the purchase and sale of revenue, that some of the revenue dealers in Milburn are bringing the first revenue dealers in the Nile to the free house vacancy tcho pepper, when the buyers had time due to the last week at the time of the World Wide Day, some revenue will be held at that time.
Hidden in the journal Daron, the number of NT News collections included eight-page insults that meant that they were cut and used as a house vacuum tush paper.
3 March, according to a report by ABC Australia, the markets were originally refusing to return those prohibitions, about which they said there was no plan to make any prohibitions on their purchases.
The Prophet Zimmermin also said that the masses, cysts, dry objects, hand-wrapping and other products, including clothes, are also more mango.
Similarly, the street dinner, outside Australia, agreed to limit the purchase of the British Shield Market to two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has announced the delivery of COVID-19 to the World Health Organization.
On the first day, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current prevalence of COVID-19 — a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — a global virus.
Although the "epidemial disease" refers to the rapid prevention of a disease, not to how dangerous specific transactions are, the World Health Organization has insisted on the need for action by the governments. "
All countries can change the world.
If the countries react to their people, take care of them, treat them, take care of them, take care of them and move them.
We are very troubled by the construction of both patterns of this disease due to the speed and severity of its side and the worrying limit of its counterfeit.
According to Dr. Tom Friedin, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this worldwide vaccine is "unusual".
He said in his remarks published in 30 in February, “In addition to the flu, no one found such a sequence in the other respiratory virus from the beginning to the world’s leading disease.”
Geibris said, “We have not seen a world-wide side of the coronavirus.”
He continued, saying, "And we have not seen such a world-wide front that has been controlled at the same time."
The new status of the World Health Organization was announced in June after the Decision of the World Health Organization to put the World Health Organization in a state of prevention of international concerns.
The director of the U.S. National Disease and Multiple Disease Institute on Twitter, Dr. Kathmuni Fusi said about this side that "I am, that it is growing toward further disaster."
Associated Press that the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide increased by 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
Current 2019-20 Coronavirus is a part of the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which causes severe respiratory disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
In December 2019 it was signed in China's city of Wuhan, and on 30 January 2020 it was declared an international concern as a public health disorder, and on 11 March 2020 it was recognized as a global concern.
By 10 April 2020, 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were in 210 countries and lines, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
There are approximately 364,000 people.
The figure of the deaths in China has decreased by 4% while on a global level, it has increased from 13.04 % in Algeria to 08 % in Hocker New Zealand.
Its general signs include trouble in steam, gains and breathing.
Complications may include symptoms of severe difficulty in breathing and breathing.
The period from the appearance to the beginning of the symptoms of the disease is generally approximately five days unless it may be within two days.
There is no known vaccine or special anti-viral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptoms and assistant treatment – prescribed precautionary measures include mouth, chronic dysfunction, distance from other people, and anxiety and anxiety for those people who are suspicious of being affected.
The world’s overseas governments have advocated travel settlements, cartridges, carrefour access, control of hazards on the workplace and dismantling facilities.
The World Wide Web has followed disadvantages, disadvantages, religious, political and cultural reports in several global social economies and has promised the widespread implementation of the system caused by purchases in mindfulness.
In 193 countries, schools and universities were either closed at national or local level, affecting 99.4 percent of the world’s population.
Mistakes about the virus were revealed online and the Chinese people, the East and Southeast Asia color and the other generations of people and those people have occurred disrespect and privileged behavior events where the virus facts have become exaggerated.
The income was reduced and the air was dirty due to the closure of large industries and the carbon expulsion was reduced.
Health officials in China's city of Wuhan (Huawei province's century) a set of unknown causes of sample cases on 31 December 2019 and launched an investigation about it at the beginning of January 2020.
Most of these facts are related to the Hunan Seafood food flood market and therefore it is believed to be from the generation of animal diseases.
The virus by which it is known as SARS-CoV-2 is a new received virus that has a close association with the coronavirus, the pingoline coronavirus and the SARS-CoV. The first person who has the symptoms of this disease has become sick on 1 December 2019, and that person has no appearance to be associated with the market group.
Two of the initial events in December 2019 are related to the markets.
On March 13, 2020 South China's Marning Post ordered in an uncertain report that on November 17, 2019 the incident of a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province could be the first - on February 26, 2020 the World Health Administration that although the events are low in China, but due to the increase in incidents in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new events from China increased for the first time compared to the new events within China.
It is likely that the number of events will be reduced, especially in people with common symptoms of disease.
On 26 February, relatively low incidents were among teenagers aged 19 and under the age of the year, resulting in 2.4 percent of incidents worldwide.British Chief Scientific Councillor Peter Willens estimated that 60% of the population of Britain would be affected by the previously effective attack.
According to the official protocol, the number of people involved in the facts is the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and their results can be confirmed to be positive.
Until March 23, no country tested 3% of its population, and this official policy of several countries suggests that only normal markers will not be tested, as did in Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
In a study published on March 16, it was published that in China, 86% of patients with COVID-19 had not been identified until January 23, and it was a source of infection in 79% of non-registered patients.
A numerical analysis, which was released on March 30, estimated that the number of infection affected in Italy was more than the reports were.
For COVID-19, the initial estimate of the basic re-creation number (R0) is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Committee concluded that it could be 5.7.
People with COVID-19 may be healthier.
For those who do not stop it, the period from the appearance of the symptoms of the disease to the death is 6 to 41 days, most of which in the year is 14 days.
Up to 10 April 2020, 97,000 people were killed in COVID-19.
In China, by April 5th, 80% of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75% of people have previous diseases including movement heart disease and the official number of deaths from the COVID-19 World Health Organization is generally included in those deaths that received their COVID test in accordance with the official protocol.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 is likely to be many more than that, because those deaths do not include those who may die without the test - for example, in the home, in the home, and so on.
Some data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during this global cycle exceeded x4-5 of the official number of deaths from COVID.
A translator of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) submitted "We know that [the number of deaths] has been reduced", this statement confirms the reports of the reduced number of deaths in the U.S. The discount reports of this section are mostly followed during the World Health Organization as the 2009 H1 of this 1 Swine Flood period. The first incident of the confirmed deaths occurred on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Isaiah occurred on 14 February in France.
Up to 28 February, outside Central China, more than a degree of death may be located in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Until March 13, more countries and lines from the Chalis, from each major to the South, provided information about the dead. There are several common measures used to determine the dead.
With the passage of the line and time, these numbers are different, and the testing, the standards of the treatment system, the treatment powers, the time and population characteristics after the initial break of the disease, such as life, gender and overall health, are affected. The proportion of events and deaths is achieved by dividing the number of deaths in a particular period by the identified events.
Based on the figures of the John Hopkins University, the global deaths and events ratio by April 10 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number of lines is different.
In China, the ratio of events and deaths (1-10 January 2020 for illnesses from the beginning of the disease signs) has risen by less than 17.3% (for illnesses from the beginning of the disease until February 2020) by 0.7% - other measures include the Death Index (CFR) that indicates the percentage of the diagnosed deaths from the disease, and the Infection Death Index (IFR) that indicates the percentage of the affected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) that result from a disease.
This number of times is not for any particular time and from infection to the last solution of the leaker transaction for a particular residence.
Many experts have been trying to bring this number to some specific populations.
Based on the evidence of the Oxford University, the Medison Center estimates that the rate of deaths from infection in this world is between a total of 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest limit of this estimate corresponds to the results of the previous differentiated tests of COVID-19 conducted in Germany, and a numerical study that analyses the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that the world has been controlled.
The disease is different and different in terms of its occurrence.
Pine State University's McKee Bonnie said, "There will be no junk, the multiplayer generally rises as the level is high and the level may start down when the disease is no longer hosted.
But it is unlikely that when it comes to it, it will now be a reasonable plan."
Chinese government’s high medical counselor Zhang Nanjing said “This could end until June” if all countries were encouraged to act on its advice on the measures to prevent the infection of the virus.
On March 17, Edm Charsky of the London School of Higher Education and Tropical Medium told that SARS-CoV-2 "probably continues to circulate for one or two years."
According to the study of the Imperial College in Neil Ferguson, the distance between each other and other measures will be required until "unless any vaccine is achieved (probably 18 months or more)"
Wilm Schiffner of the University of Windworth said, “I think it’s not possible that this coronavirus—it’s going to end completely—because it’s easily transmitted” and it’s going to become a temporary disease, and it’s going to come back every year.”
The death of the return will be reduced by the attack and the limit of its change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 disease are relatively unprecedented and people affected may be without any symptoms.
Two common signs are steam (88%) and dry cannabis (68%)
The low-common signs include swelling, bullying in the woods (although), end of the function of the sunshine, end of the breath, pain in the legs and legs, swelling in the woods, headaches, colds, cough, blood clots, sickness or nils. The World Health Office reports that one of the people may be seriously ill and have trouble breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include in the list of symptoms: breathing difficulties, frequent pain or sickness in the chest, sickness, difficulty swallowing and face or headaches; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical assistance is prescribed - further symptoms of this disease can cause severe symptoms, severe respiratory disorders, body stroke, corrupt blood and death.
Some of those affected persons may be symptoms-free, they can be diagnosed with patients confirmed by the results of the medical symptoms test, so the researchers have issued the order that people who have been contacted with the confirmed patients should be closely concerned and tested to stay away from infection.
The proportion of diseases without symptoms in China is reduced from several to 44%.
Generally, the duration of incubation (the average time of infection and the beginning of signs) is around one to 14 days; it is generally five days. As an example of uncertainty, the end of the feeling of swelling in people affected by COVID-19+ initially occurred in 30% people, which later occurred in less than 15% people.
This is the pathology of the disease, which is clearly the pathology of the disease.
It is believed that this disease is initially caused by a close relationship, and it is due to the bonds that are found at the time of chance, quincade or speaking; where the distance in the close relationship is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that from 4.5 meters (15 meters) to 8.2 meters (27 meters) without a discharge can be connected.
What people have been advised that the virus can spread from the bone marrow that live in the air for a long time during the time of speech. When breathing out, the respiratory bonds may be found, including during the time of chat, although this virus is not generally in the air.
These bonds may be in the midst of the nearby people or in the neck, or may be in the midst of the winds when they breathe.
The medical operations such as the injection and the artificial way of injection (CPR) are easy to take the moisture out of the breath and thus it can fall into the air.
It can be seen when an influencer cheats the surface and the side then cheats its eyelids, necks or mouths.
Though there are tricks that can be removed from the eyes, the danger of it is very little thought.
The government of China has rejected the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a substance that is out of the body. This virus is very multiplied up to three days before the beginning of the signs, although its symptoms are possible before and at the last stage of the disease.
Since the test is positive three days before the beginning of the symptoms of the disease, it is believed that the transmission of the disease is possible before the symptoms of the disease appear.
Only a few confirmed facts have been from Liberty where no signs of the disease have previously been revealed unless the signs have been revealed during the investigation of relationships.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that although it is not completely clear how easily the disease can be treated, one person is generally at risk of affecting two to three people – the virus can survive from guests at different levels to days.
Specifically, this virus was recognizable on plastic (poly propylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, one day on the cat and four days on the tuberculosis.
However, this period is different in temperatures.The COVID-19 test was positive in patoes and other animals.
There is no evidence that this virus may be transmitted from animals to humans.The UK authorities advise after contact with the animals, as they do when contacting other levels that some affected people have caught.
severe respiratory symptoms Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a nucleus virus, which has previously occurred among those three people who have symptoms of inflammation that belong to the group of severe respiratory diseases in the city of Wuhan.
All properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the associated coronavirus - outside of the human body, the virus is derived from gerillus soap, which analyzes its protective power. The SARS-CoV-2 principle is close to the SARS-CoV.
It is believed that its generation is from animal diseases.
Genetic analysis shows that the coronavirus is relatively derived from the two foods of the subproportion of the BTA coronavirus (proportion B), the proportion belongs to the family of the coronavirus.
On the overall genome level, this second triangular coronavirus sample (BatCoV RaTG13) has a 96% similarity.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in humans and pinguin viruses there is a difference of only one amino thinning in several parts of the genome series.
Until now, in the balance of supplementary genes, it has been shown that most 92% of the genetic ingredients are common in the penogulin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that it is the average host of the penogulin virus.
The random diagnosis of viral infection is likely on the basis of the symptoms of the disease, although the last work certified by the fluid material or the ICT Institute is done through the resource transcription polymers China response (rRT-PCR).
In a study balancing the PCR with the CT in Wuhan, it was shown that the CT is less specific but more sensitive compared to the PCR, while its image features contain other symptoms and disease function.
Up to March 2020, the American College of Radiology prescribes that CT should not be used for screens or as the first test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test at the same time uses the reverse transcription polymers China response (rRT-PCR).
This test is done on a breath or blood sample.
The results are generally achieved from a number of guests to a lot of days.
Generally, this test is done through anaphylactic method, but it is the only way to use the method in the grass - many liberty and companies are the same way to use the method, which has been identified by the Internet.
By April 6, 2020, no one of them will be sufficiently correct so that it will be intended for large-scale use.
In the United States, a surrographic test was prepared by Silx, which was intended to be used only in documented labs.
The characteristics of photography on the people's radiography and compound tomography (CT), in which the symptoms of this disease are observed, include asymmetric peripheral granate glass opcites and unprecedented excess flow.
The Tel Aviv Radio Society has built an international online database of video outcomes.
Due to being overlipsed by other infections such as the adenoid virus, COVID-19 has limited characteristics of recognition of the mutilation without the documentation of PCR.
A large study in China balanced the PCR of the CT results of sinus which showed that although the photography for infection carries low properties, it is sharp and too sensitive, the prescription is that it was considered to be used as a screening machine in web areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neuronal networks were built to detect both the viral image properties, through radio and CT.
The wisdom of the prevention of the transmission of this disease includes, in general, the maintenance of the health of any natural guardians, the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths of the mouths.
Those who have already suffered from this infection are advised to wear ceramic masks on public places.
For the prevention of the disease from the transmission, distances are prescribed from each other – several countries have restricted travel or prevented unnecessary travel to other countries or have prohibited travel to the lines that are affected by this disease.
However, the virus has reached the stage of infection in a large portion of the world.
This means that the virus is being spread within the society and the people of which communities do not know how and where they are likely to be affected—health-related people, who are susceptible to be affected by this disease, are advised to establish standard precautionary measures on contact and whose protection—the contact for health governments is an important way to seek the source of this infection and to find its further transitional approach.
For this purpose, the government’s use of local data through mobile phones has been disrupted by the secret, the Security International and 100 other regulations have issued a statement in which it is said to limit this section of concern.
Up to April 7, 2020 various mobile apps have logged it or advised for satisfactory use, more than a degree of group is working on a confidentiality friend solution, such as using Bluetooth – obtaining the user’s location from the other mobile.
After that, the user receives a message if someone is closely checked to a person whose COVID-19 result is positive. errors are circulating in the cycle of infection prevention; for example, putting water in the neck and scratching the dead wheat are not effective.
There is no wiki for COVID-19, but many agencies work on one’s line.
It is advised to prevent the disease.
CDC people are advised by most sabes to two seconds, especially after the house is empty or when it is apparently dry; before it is dry; and when someone is cleansing the neck, it is swallowed, or it is swallowed.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by grapefruit when its protective body is dropped.
The CDC further recommends the use of the Hindu synthesizer based on the solution, which contains less than 60% of the solution in terms of volume, when soap and water are not available.
The world’s health agency advises people to escape from those who do not, or do not, or do not.
The levels should be cleaned in a number of ways (the level of stein-less steel should be stretched for a minute in front of a bacteria), which contains 62-71 % ethanol, 50-100 % soprophanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 % pavoidone-iodine.
Other methods, such as Bensalconium Chloride and Chronic Acid Gluconite are less effective.
CDC prescribes if any suspected or certified COVID treatment is listed on the site, for example, office or office, all relationships, i.e. office, house, joint paper, joint electrical equipment such as tablets, touchscreen, board, remote control, ATM machines, which patients use, will be removed from the bacteria.
The health regulations have ordered that people open and hide their mouths from their melted clothes or clothes and immediately destroy such clothes.
The prescription to wear a circular mask is for those who may be affected, because the impact of the mask is both limiting the volume and distance of the bonds that the person is being removed, when it speaks, quincillates and moves.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has been informing you when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Ladies Virus, "Masking is less likely for people to hide their heads, which is a major source of infection if they do not use the appropriate preservatives of their heads."The use of the mask is prescribed for those who are responsible for the treatment of someone affected.
The World Health Office has prescribed to healthy people to wear a mask only when their health is seriously dangerous, as those people are diagnosed with a COVID-19 patient, although they admit that people wear a mask to escape their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage people to wear the face mask.
The U.S. advises to wear non-medical face masks from CDC clothes - China has specifically prescribed that healthy people use harmful medical masks, especially when other people are likely to go close to (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong prescribes to wear circular masks that are used by the public injury or in the wounded places.
The health officials of the airland are encouraging people to make clothes in the clothes and to breathe them daily.
The people of Tsai and Slowaqi have stopped going to the people without the masks or without their neck and meat.

RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which affects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is special and only made for the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to verify the current or active infection.
It can also be used for the diagnosis of the disease and for the concern of the population.
These tests show how many people had this disease, including those who had so few signs that were too common to report or who did not show any signs.

Strength defence on the infection includes IgM and IgG’s part reaction intestines.
They can be used for infection on those people in which the signs have passed 7 days from the beginning, for strength defense determination, and for those who are in short concerns. Central Liberatories (CLT) or the Center for Protection Testing (PoCT) can be consulted.
In many clinical library, the self-working system prepared for the highest level will be possible of these components, unless their achievement is suspended on the description of the result for each system.
A single blood sample is generally used for CLT, although many of the samples can be used for strength defense capture.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is generally derived from a hole on the skin.

The form explains that the cause of the wrong result is not to correctly use raw materials or cuts in the sample training.
The Ministry of Spin said that the wrong resulting cards will be removed and replaced with the testing cards provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% purchased from China by the President's Check were wrong results. 1.2 million purchased from China by Slovakia will not correct.
The Turkish Ministry of Health, ATSKARA, said that the products that Turkey has purchased from China have "too much description of misconduct" and they have not been "used into use."British will buy 3.5 million tests from China unless it was announced in early April 2020 that it was unused.
The results of the test showed the best results of the people who were tested in the event of positive results and the attempts to identify those people who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 hunting patients.
In Italy's Chapel Vo, Italy's place where the first death of COVID-19 occurred, the working researchers of the entire population, which included 3,400 people, tested twice for less than ten days.
Almost those who were tested were among people who had no signs, and all the received cases were tested.
The limitation of travel to a particular human group resulted in the new infection case completely ended.
The World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2020 Coronavirus World Health Organization (WHO).
Many reports have been aged, and Singapore has started the advisory day from 28 March that citizens remain limited to their homes, unless the school opened after the holidays ended on 23 March.
Many other countries were able to identify people who were linked to this worldwide disease through severe measures such as travel arrangements, testing and cartridges, except that they did not make any more severe breakdown, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a number of research, those countries have tested the most, on account of the description of the deaths, the description of the deaths of them is less, this may be due to the fact that these countries are likely to have the same number of people with little signs or without signs.
The WHO has ordered that countries with which they are not qualified to test and ethnic liberty fighting COVID-19, then they send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16reference liberty for certification testing.
They are 7 of the 16 refurbishes in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the word "procent of positive texts" belongs to any country's testing policy.
The country that only tests the people entering the hospital, there will be more than the % of the positive tests compared to the country that app tests all citizens, whether they show signs or not, they will all be equal.
Hand clots (or hand clots) are also known as the health of the hand, the purpose of this procedure is to clean your hands from thinning, chewing, bacteria or other unnecessary substances.
In some "necessary occasions" a day many diseases are prevented from spreading by hand-to-hand swallowing, for example, the bacteria of the spine and the spine are in the direction of the spine.
People can also be hunted by respiratory diseases such as flu or general disorder, for example, if they don’t wash their hands before they cover their eyes, nails, or muscles (i.e., myox disorders).
In one day they are five necessary times when hand washing with soap is not essential: before and after going to the house, after the cleaning of the baby's small portion or after the change of the deper, before the baby's meal, before the meal and before and after the preparation of the meal, or after the hiding of cheese, fish or cheese.
If the water and soap are not available, the hands can also be cleaned from the roof.The World Health Administration says the following to the hands:
Before, during and after eating.
before and after the patient.
Conversion of the deper or after the clearance of the child using the towel.
after healing, climbing or climbing.
After the animal, the food of the animal or the merit of the animal.
The health care provider should be in accordance with the principles of health care.
Drinking the hands before eating the drug or taking it medically may reduce or reduce the disease.
Medically, the main purpose of handwashing is to cleanse the hands from phytogenes (bacteria, viruses, or other nutrient bacteria that cause the disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially for those who belong to food or medicine, unless this is a good habit for the general people.
There are many medical benefits of handwashing, including reducing the prevalence of flu, coronavirus, and other multiple diseases; preventing the causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
And the children who are in the house should be described in the deaths.
A 2013 study shows that many children under the age of five have a significant increase in height.
In developing countries, by making simple changes in habits, respiratory and respiratory diseases can cause little deaths in children, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the deaths of these diseases by up to 50%.
Any intervention that increases the strength of the hand can take a little bit in the description of the death from the events of the sunset, and its balance can be made by the supply of pure water in the low-income areas.
In the description of stroke death, it can be reduced to 48% due to hand-throwing from soap. hand-throwing from soap is the most effective and easy way to cure from stroke and severe respiratory infection (ARI). This is a self-working method that can be operated in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Symptomy in children under the age of five years, a major ARI, is the largest cause of death, killing 1.8 million children each year.
The disease causes approximately 3.5 million children’s deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, converting the habit of handwashing before and after meals into a natural secondary can save more lives than using a vaccine or medically introducing it, i.e. a small amount of fat in the deaths and a small amount of fat in the deaths caused by a severe respiratory infection.
Hand wash is generally part of other things of health and cleanliness, namely water, water and sanitary health program (WASH).
The hand is safe from the sickness that is transmitted from the right hand.
A small disadvantage of the hand is that the load of the hand can be damaged by the drying of the skin from the load of the hand.
According to a 2012 study in Denmark, more hands-on headaches can become skin hurt, which is called chenble or skin burning and which is generally found in the medical sector and the average people.
The burden of the hand is also seen as a sign of more anxiety than necessary (OCD).
There are five such delicate occasions a day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the disease that spreads through spine and meat: after the use of the hand room (pre- or transitional), after the cleansing of the baby from the bottom (changing of the dioper), before the baby feeds, before and after the meat and before and after the preparation of the meat or before and after the hiding of cheese, fish or cheese.
Other occasions where the hand should be washed correctly in order to prevent the transmission of the disease include: before and after fighting with the wound; after swallowing, swallowing or refining; after animals or animals' repair and repair; and after swallowing the wound.
In many countries, the hand is less explained.
According to a survey conducted in 54 countries in 2015, an average of 38.7% of people living in households suffer from their own hand soap. According to the 2014 survey, this description is the highest in Saudi Arabia, 97 per cent; the average is in the United States, 77 per cent; and the lowest in China, 23 per cent.
The required "Health Protection Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a breakthrough on the large scale of health and education of the bacteria.
This ethnic program includes daily hand washing from soap, fluoride daily washing from soap with twice a year.
It has also been successfully done in Indonesia.
In the process of removal of the bacteria, much of the soap and detergents are placed in water.
The principle of the work of the soap and detergents is to reduce the recovery and increase the solution.
Only water is insufficient for skin cleansing because the cranes and proteins, which are the components of the mineral, are not easily solved in water.
Safety, however, is the help of the right water flow..
In tuberculosis, the cause of reuse may be bacteria due to past use.
Several researchers have studied the transmission of bacteria from polluted soap, saying it could not be transmitted because the bacteria disappears with the soap.
The CDC also says that "the liquid soap is preferable without control of the hands."
A lot of health-related bacteria have been given to the people.
So far there is no such evidence that the use of the ordered bacterial drug finds in nature intrusive anomalies of vitality.
However, in antibacterial sabons there are such general antibacterial factors, such as turklosane, which are disruptive for non-biotic vitalities.
So if they don’t choose the antibacterial soap antibacterial disruptor, they won’t be as effective as they were said about.
In addition to the humidifying substances and skin feeding factors, more fluid formations can be PH-regulator, bacterially active Bensonic Acid (Acetic Acid, Scorbic Acid, Lactic Acid), and skin condensers (Elo-Vira, Vitamin, Mental, Powder Arthritis) as well. University and Fygon, according to the detailed analysis of the School of Public Health, simple soap are also the same workers for consumers in which the Inti-Bicterial soap is triggered that causes diseases and causes bacteria from the hands.
The hot water in which the hand is easy is not so hot that the bacteria will be killed.
Bacteria rise faster than body temperature (37°C).
However, the power oil, which absorbs methyl and bacteria, is more effective than half-gram, soft water to remove it than soft water.
However, contrary to public beliefs, a scientific study says that half a gram of water is not effective in reducing bacteria from the hands.
A hand synthesizer or hand incyptic is a non-water-based hand health agency.
In the 1990s and in the beginning of the 21st century, the water-based cleansing factor (a hand-based cleansing factor, bacterial cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor, or hand-based cleansing factor).
Most isopropyl are based on isopropyl or ethanol, which are adjusted to a crop factor, such as Carbomer (multi-healthy compound of multi-acid) in a glycerin or any humidity, such as glycerin, which is adjusted to liquid or easy to use and to reduce the effect of the drought of the isopropyl.
Including oxide on solved hydrogen increases the intricate microbe entertainment. It is an effective bacterial agent in hand syne teaser in which the amount of solution is from 60 to 95%.
Influential syndrome thyroids kill bacteria, multi-medicine defensive bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, viruses, viruses, flu, hepatitis) and fungus.
Solved sinus thizers which contain 70% of the solution (some in 3.5 lbs, which is equal to 35 dB) give 99.97% of the bacteria after 30 seconds of use and 1 minute after use give 99.99% to 99.999% (some in 4 to 5 lbs) of the bacteria.
Handsine-based tuberculosis is almost entirely ineffective for neurovirus or (Norwalk), which is the most common cause of multiple diseases of small antiseptic inflammation.
The front and later parts of both hands and the middle and last parts of all angins shall be washed for approximately 30 seconds, unless the material, gums or gels are dry.
Angials should also be well washed and put on both hands. The U.S. Center orders hand washing from disease control and anti-cancer syndrome tires, especially when the hands appear to be contaminated.
The reason for the speed in the use of such materials is the ability to easily and quickly kill the bacteria in their use; however, they should not consider the exchange of the official hands, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
The solution may be quickly dry by more use of the silk teaser, unless the formula contains creams and/or brushing items.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or end the drying effect of the solution.
The clinical experiments have shown that the use of clay-based hand syne teasers that included cream, the ratio of soap or antimicrobial detergent, slow down and dry the skin.
Different early illnesses or a lot more sensitive to the disease or a lot more sensitive to the disease or a lot more sensitive to the disease or a lot more sensitive to the disease or a lot more sensitive to the disease.
In the face of the hand dropped by the soap and the water, it turned to them, so that this rapidly spread to the sickness.
Despite their effectiveness, the waterproofing agent does not clear the substances, they just cleanse them from the bacteria.
Therefore, many bacteria are not more effective than soap and water for the supply of bacteria, because the bacteria live on the hand.
The most exclusive components and compounds of the effectiveness of the cleansed hand silk teaser are, and historically it remains not much more effective.
In these days in which compounds have been used benzyme chloride in them, unlike the solution, the total intimicrobial activity has been observed after use, and after frequent use, the result of the soon found reaction, its function has been slightly reduced.
Many of the people who are low-income in the world do not buy soap and use soap or soap instead of it.
It can be more effective than water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if it is infected due to the bacteria, it can increase the risk of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like the soap, it is a factor to end the bacteria because it creates a caline behavior after it is filled with water.
The World Health Organization (WHO) orders rough or meat in the event that it is not softened.
The correct method of handwashing ordered by the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in order to prevent the disease, includes the following:
Drink your hands with warm or cold water.
Water is ordered for this because fresh water can be contaminated, when the temperature of the water does not differ.
Close your hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the middle places of the angels and the lower parts of your nails.
Soap quickly removes the bacteria, and research shows that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of water.
less than 20 seconds.
It will help to get rid of the infection, and it will help to get rid of the infection, and it will help to get rid of the infection, and it will help to get rid of the infection.
Clean the water well.
It can be infected again by the hand.
Clean the water or dry the water.
It can easily be reinfected by the gland and handworms. The generally abandoned parts include angina, clay, spots between the angins and around the nails.
Artificial nails and half-threatened neal pulse can be associated with bacteria.
Moisturizing lotions are generally prescribed to protect the hands from dry; it can damage the skin from dry skin, which can increase the risk of infection.
Where there is no water and/or soap available, there can be very few discharge facilities for them, such as a stainless concrete or locomotive vegetable in which there is a suitable hole, the use of water and/or discharge in developing and/or emerging countries. In such a situation when the water supply is low (sized or emerging countries), there are discharge solutions, such as "tippy-taps" or other low discharge methods.
Tipy-tap is a simple technique in which there is a jewel that is folded by a rope and a leather that moves by the legs from which a little bit of water is dulled on a bag of hands and soap.
Hand drying effectively is part of the hand guard health action, but it is discussed that public heat is the most effective way of drying in houses.
Most research finds that paper pipes are better than electric dryers, which are found in most heat houses.
In 2008, the University of West Center, London, conducted a study, and it was sponsored by the paper manufacturing industry, the European Touch Symposium, which included paper products, heated handdressers and new Jet Air handdressers in order to advance health levels.
After hand drying from heating and hot breathing, the number of bacteria on the angials increased by an average of 194% and the number of bacteria increased by 254%.
As a result of drying from Jet Air Dryer, the indication of bacteria increased by 42% on angials and 15% on bacteria.
After drying the hands and drying the piper, the total number of bacteria on the angiopaths decreased to an average of 76% and the total number of bacteria on the bacteria decreased to 77%. Scientists also asked to prove whether the drying method of each section is the result of the work of the other washroom users and the ability to spread pollution into the environment of the washroom.
The Jet Air Driver, which makes the unity’s discharge of the air at 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has the power to discharge the bacteria from the hands and units and can contaminate the other users of the aircraft and the aircraft’s environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
Heat and hand-dryer bacteria can spread at a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No specific bacteria spread from the tower. in 2005 a study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt assessed the work of various methods of hand drying.
The following changes occurred in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many hand-drying various dryers manufacturing works, and the balance of the dryers is made of paper products.
In the absence of soap and water during the time of travel, the hand-to-hand exchanges from the sealed paper.
The solution-based sinus teaser carries less than 60% of the solution.
Medically, handwashing made it necessary after receiving its effectiveness in the hospital environment by Ignaz Semmelweis (1846) by Ignaz Semmelweis.
There are electrical machines that feed the hospitals so that when they forget the place they will be reminded that they will throw their hands.
According to a study, the use of the infection in the description occurred slightly.
Medically, the hand's stretch is for less than 15 seconds, soap and water or gel should be used in a certain amount to stretch and stretch every part of the hand.
The angels of the hands are attached to each other.
If there is desire in the nails of the angels, it can be used hard balls or cuts to remove it.
Because the bacteria can remain in the water in the hands, it is necessary that the water be well dried and someone dried them with a pure pot.
After drying, the paper powder should be used to shut the water (and if necessary to open the door to return).
The hands will not be contaminated again after it falls on these levels.
The purpose of hand-throwing in the order of health care is to remove Pythogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and prevent them from transmitting them.
According to a report by the New England Journal of Medicine, the description of handwashing is also unacceptable in the medical environment, there is a large number of doctors and doctors who usually forget their handwashing before the patient is hiding, thus calling the means of the transmission of bacteria.
According to a study, working on the right hands and other simple methods reduces the infection in the description of the propellent nodes by up to 66%.The World Health Administration has published a paper showing the right way to hand and hand in the health sector.
The department’s hands-on draft guidelines can be viewed on its website for public comments.
A related review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial machinery can check and verify the safety and purity of the hand, if it is necessary to do so.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the “Five Places” of Hand Done:
Blood and body humidity.
before the infection, and
After the patient’s thought—the addition of the medicated or “antimicrobial” chemicals to the soap—the work of the bacterial destruction is included in the hand-threatening factor.
The demand for such bacteria is where before or where the intramuscular disruption is very important. For the operation, it is necessary to "rush" your hand to be a tone that can be opened and closed without a hand cut, with chlorhexidine or iodine, with the hand drying after, with the bacteria clean, with the bacteria clean, and with the other bacteria clean for the purification of the angial nails.
All the sights will be removed.
In this process, the hands are taken up to a length, generally 6-2 minutes.
It is not necessary to go late (10 minutes).
When the water flows on the middle of the arm, they think that they are not back to their hands.
When the clothes of the hands are completed, the hands are drowned with clean clothes from the bacteria and the surgeon is found.
To reduce the process of spread of bacteria, it is better to wash the hands before and after seeing the patient or to put bacterial substances on the hands.
To prevent staphylococcal infection in hospitals, the research found that the greatest benefits of hand cleansing were derived from the first 20% dose, and that when this score increased to 35%, there was very little additional benefits.
In addition to the transmission of multi-bacterial diseases in food, the use of simple soap in the ratio of antibacterial soap showed three times more effect. The solution based on the soap and the balance of antibacterial soap every 30 seconds revealed that the ratio of antibacterial soap from the ratio to the ratio was 26% less in bacterial contamination.
Unless H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores are removed from the hands, the ratio of the solution based on the soap and water is more effective. On health-related places, if the health and cleansing of the hand is improved, then it will be taught of the steaf for the hand, the solution for the hand based on the soap is achieved, and the steaf will be given written and language notes.
In addition, further research is needed to find out how the measures are more effective in different health-related arrangements.
In developing countries, handwashing from soap is thought to be a means of getting low prices, good health, and even good food,
However, the lack of independent supply of water, soap and hand washing facilities in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes the worldwide hand washing habit of all people a big challenge.
For example, in more districts of Africa, it is very common to have a hand-to-hand tone close to someone or public toilets, while the very low prices of making hand-to-hand places are possible.
However, the cause of reducing the description of the hand can also be cooking the habit instead of the amount of soap and water.
Sabbath can influence the encouragement and decision-making of handworms, can find awareness of the benefits of handworms, and can find long-term changes in the mode of behavior.
It is necessary to be worried and worried to make it effective.
The result of an official study of 70 students scientists found that working in a particular community in LMICs remains more effective, when the chart series of social marketing is less effective. The measure of the chart of handwashing in schools is "thin star approach" by UNICEF, it increases the incentives of schools that they take simple and less retarding measures to ensure that other guarantees, in addition to the principles of health, students scientists throw their hands from the soap.
When they reach the lowest standard, the class can reach the second and then the third stars.
The place of hand-threatening can be part of the hand-threatening series, which aims to reduce diseases and deaths in children.
The World Handheld Day is the second example of the promulgation of this series, the aim of which is to change the dream. As a result of the 2019-20 Corona Virus World Wide Web, UNICEF has increased the strength of handheld emojis.
Some research has suggested that the overall hand loss is less expensive to review DALYs in developing countries.
However, according to a ratio of water and the control of its clearance, the hand from the soap to the fruit of the water has a lower weight.
The importance of handwashing for human health – especially for those who are in unsafe conditions, such as those left wars have already infested the child or wounded in hospitals – was first revealed by the first two physicists of handwashing in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and the second English Florence Nightingale who was “the founder of the new nursing.”
At that time, most people still thought that the cause of infection was evil.
In 1980, due to food-related diseases and health-related infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increased intensity of hand cleansing as a major means of preventing infection.
In 2009 Swine Floor and in 2020 COVID-19 World Health Organization (WHO) members in many countries admitted that handwashing from soap is essential for the prevention of many diseases.
For example, posters with "Right Hand Drawing Techniques" were placed on hand Drawing Places outside the public house cell, in the office buildings' roofs and on the airport in Germany.
The phrase "Washing one's hands of" means that no one declares to take responsibility for anything or give no word.
This proverb is from the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate expressed his discretion with the decision of Jesus to go to Soly, unless it later became a proverb in the English-speaking community.
In Shakespeare’s drama, Lady Mickbite is forced to keep herself hand-to-hand in an imaginary attempt to clear the heat, which shows the discomfort of consciousness due to the crime of killing her husband.
It is also revealed that people, after remembering or thinking about an unethical act, are more hands-on than others, and consider the hand-on brethren much more important.
Furthermore, those who are handwashing after such ideas take a little part in other entertainments of "fairness", for example, doing good work.
The preservatives also prescribe hand wipes under the health and symbolic purpose.The preservatives prescribe hand wipes according to the health, i.e. the use of soap water without hand wipes, many preservatives are characteristic: for example, the strike, the Hindu wipes, the Jewish wipes, the Nithelets, the Lava in the Christ and the Light Islam.The preservatives prescribe hand wipes according to the health, especially after some works.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, the use of toilets is necessary.
And in Judaism, and in Islam, before and after every meal, it is necessary to wash hands.
Risk on workplaces for COVID-19
Practical measures related to health and protection are implemented for the prevention of the risk of COVID-19 (COVID-19) at workplaces.
The exclusive approach to risk at workplaces is based on the quality of workplaces and workplaces, the risk diagnosis of exposure causes, the severity of the disease in the community, and in those employees that may be unsafe for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Protection and Health Regulation (OSHA), low-discovery risk tasks are those in which people and other people are at least professional contacts with our jobs, for which basic measures are prescribed to protect against infection, including handwashing, if the employees are sick, increasing the resistance of rebellion in their homes, breathing habits, and keeping the work environment clean and clean from bacteria.
The risk of intermediate disclosure is the responsibilities that are in contact with people about whom there is nothing known to be affected by COVID-19, unless it can be affected by social transit and international travel.
It includes those employees whose contact is with the public, such as in the schools, the work environment in the treasury and more places of exhibition.
In addition to the basic protective measures of infection protection for this grass, high-performance air filter, protection against scratch, and if someone is affected by COVID-19, there is an indigenous protection system available, including.
The OSHA COVID-19 is considered to be a subjective risk to the health care and the appearance of the employees of the dead family, a much more exposure risk if the employees perform the method of finding aerosol or collect or process samples from a known or suspect person with COVID-19.
These employees will be able to take appropriate measures to take the risk, such as air-income and discharge-negative boilers, and an inherent protection system that is based on the quality of the work.
There are many possible effects of COVID-19 in the workplace.
Prevision of the risk of being sick, protection of others, or fear of being exposed to the disease may cause the employee to be unavailable.
Trade methods can be converted into work, as well as in terms of the demand of the items and as well as in terms of the acquisition of those items (such as purchased at low-end times, or dealer or drive-track facilities)
Finally, from geographically severe affected areas from COVID-19 the system can be disrupted. The plan of preparing for multiple diseases and reacting to it can be used for the guidance of safeguard actions.
The plans indicate the levels of risk depending on different workplaces and employment jobs, including the causes of disclosure, the risk factors arising from the family and brotherhood order, and the risk factors for individual employees such as aging or permanent medical conditions.
They also set out the ways and the circumstances that occur as a result of the disruption that are necessary to combat these risks.
It may be the subject of a planned or relational treatment for multiple diseases.
Reduce the cross-border traffic in order to react to someone, protect those people who are at risk of bad health complications, and reduce the negative effects in the series of entertainment and entertainment.
In the community where the work is located, it affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The risk assessment framework is very useful in professional protection and health, so that the group risks can be effectively addressed.
Where the risks of COVID-19 can not be ended, there are the most effective controls that will be placed, after which the regulatory controls come, and ultimately the inherent protection system.
In the state of control, the employers, without relying on their dreams, must be aligned with the work-related risks, and this can be the lowest cost and solution for the implementation.
The policy of work and method of work, which is referred to by the regulatory control, which requires the work from the employee or owner, is changed.
The indigenous protection system (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and regulatory control, unless it can help prevent some appearance.
The selection of all types of PPE employees should know what on the basis of the risks, installed in the appropriate way, if it is applicable (the device, the salinating machine), consistently and correctly known, exhausted and converted, which may also be necessary, if correctly removed, clean and stored in the correct way known or damaged to protect from pollution.
According to the U.S. Professional Health and Safety Authority (OSHA), low-discovery risk tasks are at least in professional relationships with people and other tasks.
The basic measures for the prevention of infection for all workplaces that have been ordered include carrying the load and fully hand, increasing the staff’ awareness that if they are sick they stand at home, climbing, climbing and climbing, calling on the phone or, if necessary, monitoring the attendance, breaking the staff’s ability to use other machinery and equipment, and cleaning and infection according to the usual workplace.
It may be a worrying step for the protection of employees, customers, meetings and other persons at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) orders that those officers who have signs of severe respiratory illness should stand at home until the vapour, vapour signs, or any other signs end without the use of less than 24 hours of vapour or other signs reducing drugs, and that the illness licensed policies are clear, allowing the officers to see the sick person in the family, and that the officers are aware of these policies.
Risk of median disclosure, according to OSHA, are tasks in which people who are not known to be suspicious or affected by COVID-19 are required for close or consistent contact at a distance of six feet (1.8 meters), but the business pass may be affected by either the existing community transmissions or by SARS-CoV-2, or by the fact that the person is on an international journey where COVID-19 has been transmitted on a large scale.
It also includes those employees whose contact is with the people, such as the schools, the work environment in the treasury and the number of high-risk groups. It and more dangerous groups to put control include high-functioning air filter installation, air-income and shift description increased, material resorts such as plastic guard for the protection of the shrink, and the need for the service of the customers to install a drive-to-track staff. It and the high-risk groups regulatory control means that the patient staff will be increased in order to stand up at home, the safe front of the air-to-track will be replaced by the air-to-track, the air-to-track will be increased, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-to-track will be reduced, the air-track will be reduced, the air-track, the air-track will be reduced, the air-to-track,
The risk is the use of the respiratory mechanism in the staff.
If a person is sick in the aircraft, it means appropriate controls to protect the staff and other passengers, keep the patient at a distance of up to 6 feet from the others, assign a column of the operation to the patient, and give the patient a face mask or tell the patient to shut down from his hand and hand washing by clinging or hiding.
When a patient is returning from the passenger or hiding the body’s moisture or possibly contaminated levels, the operators of the vessel should be handed with the disposal and possibly wearing additional indigenous protection equipment, if the patient has difficulty steaming, independently breathing, or breathing.
For commercial marine vessels, including cruise vessels and other passenger vessels, the risk presence includes that the journey in the event of illness will be prompted, and to inform the medical center on the vessels immediately if there is any illness and steam or any other signs.
The CDC orders a short-term ceasefire for schools and children’s care centers that if any affected person has come to the school building, wish he has not spread the virus, then he is cleaned from pure or bacterial.
When the virus is transmitted from a small to a medium degree, the wisdom of the emotional distance can be applied to practices, such as outdoor entertainment, assemblies, and other large meetings such as physical excitement or music classes, or delaying food in the cage, increasing the gap between the discs, limiting the time of entrance and leave, avoiding unnecessary meetings, and the use of the exclusive health office for those children who have signs of pregnancy.
When there is sufficient transfer in the local community, the wisdom of the social distance can also be considered to be closed to the length of the sculptures in addition to the practice. The law enforcement operations that I do my daily entertainment, according to the CDC, the risk of immediate health for them is reduced.
The law enforcement officers, who have to contact persons carrying COVID-19 in a certain or suspicious manner, are ordered to comply with the guiding principles that are intended for immigration technology, including the appropriate intelligence protection system.
If there is a close contact during the thought period, employees should clean their diet bells and gires from the clean and bacterial with the use of home purification spray or spray before re-use, and the use of the used PPE and the loss of the consumption and the clothes should be the standard work income method to work on the work.
According to OSHA, some health centers and death households are at more or more risk of disclosure.
In more exposure-risk tasks, health-related trailers, assistants, laboratory, and medical transport staff who are known or suspected of COVID-19 patients.
These are much more exposure hazardous when employees take the operations that make the virus, or collect or monitor the samples of COVID-19 known or suspected patients.
In the operations that make irusols, to enter the wheels, to work the methods related to the wheels, to identify the wheels of the flowers, to collect some works and tests related to the scientists, or to collect unpleasant samples.
More exposure-threatening missions in the dead household include those employees who prepare the dead bodies of those people who were known at the time of death or suspected COVID-19; these risk groups include additional placed controls, including COVID-19 suspected or suspected patients.
In some health centers and mortal households, private negative wind winding machinery can be suitable.
The samples must be covered under the safety measures of Biosafety Lion 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) orders that the coming patients are kept in a special waiting room, which depends on whether they are the suspected COVID-19 case. In addition to other PPE, OSHA orders mechanical breathing for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from the suspected patient or the suspected SARS-CoV-2 person, and those who perform the erosol-producing action.
In the light of a comprehensive and literary breath protection program in the United States, the NIOSH intended N95 filtering machine should be used breathing or better, which includes appropriate testing, training and medical accessories.
Other types of mechanisms can provide better breath protection and improve the relaxation of the staff. WHO does not order fully staying because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease not transmitted by the body’s moisture.
The WHO orders only surgical masks on the inside screen for the operation.
Those who are training breath-related samples, who are looking out or transferring them without the work of the COVID-19 patients, the WHO orders shells, shells and hands for their surgical masks, glasses, or faces.
If the method of making aerosol is performed, then the N95 or FFP2 machine breathes instead of the circular mask.
Knowing that PPE’s global resilience is insufficient, WHO TV media, material remnants such as smoothies, only allow them to enter the spine that keeps COVID-19 patients looking right, the use of PPE is necessary for special work, the hunting of the same disease keeps many patients looking for the same machine to breathe without the use of the spine, the concern and control of the PPE shipping of China, and the use of the masks of people without signs to be broken.

This month we have an unusual event.
COVID-19 is the worldwide world that has made it clear that humans are horizontal and we have wealth on each other.
We have no previous example of such a chilling, but we know well that our best response is the worldwide we feel, cooperate, and social repair that is the spirit of this institution.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we have seen in e-mails, telephone calls and chats in all of our activities, all of this is a confirmation of how happy we are working with amazing people.
I can’t be more grateful than that and I can’t feel proud that you all my work.
Last week, someone told me about our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world that they will now return to the light of the light, and how strong it is for the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light.
Your work has made it possible, whether you are with the Sites or our work is promised or our community is saved.
The world needs information and the media provides it, now more than before.
This is the point in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will make meaningful effects on the world.
Considering the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from the coming week to how we learn how to work.
Changes in our work and shields
As Robyn previously stated, the c-team last night met to discuss our views and patterns for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we thought about what is the most appropriate answer to what is to us and how to keep the arrangement on our feet at that time.
We had a long time and we had a long time and we had a long time and we had a long time and we had a long time and a long time.
If you want to do it, it’s right.
All staff, staff and staff:
For our daily work expectations will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the second sentence,
We don't announce the deadline - if you can work according to the usual hours, then the mess can put you in use.
However, nothing can be said about the world at this time, and if you need to think about your friends, buy a pre-sale, or know to the doctor, your well-being is our preference.
We do not trace your time.
If you are sick, work.
We don’t have to say it, but we’re saying it.
Not the days of illness or the PTO demand - just check your miner and help your team to rebuild the calendar and shields, make sure that all the steps of the work are complete.
(If you get a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, inform Bryan within T&C Ops, you can help with the T&C grant and make sure that the regulation is appropriate to your status.)
The friends who work for the hours will be full of charge.
We have said this before, and we are repeating our responsibilities to our rightholders and to the staff who work on the account of the hours.
Each person will be charged with the time of their ordinary circumstances.
It includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people work around the world to change their minds.
What we can do is uncertain to the extent of profit, especially in such days.
Again, it’s all for your own protection.
We only say that you talk to your buyer, it will make us know what they expect from you and then make things according to it.
No work is needed.
There are things we need to keep on.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fund training teams (excluding funds) are working hard, for which additional support may be needed.
We with all the peoples join the current objectives and support what is necessary for our mission, turn our attention.
We all have a lot to do, we all will focus on the most important projects.
We will not be troubled by this time.
We don’t plan that once this world will be over, we’ll “complete the break”.
You are not expected to have extra time to work to complete the deadlines, which is not real at this time.
We admit that the circumstances have changed, and where appropriate we will work to create new targets and timeline.
What do we have to do with APP?
To arrange our new truth and daily working hours expectations, we are willing to arrange our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We want to expand into our 2019-2020 plan that takes a lot of time to create a job where employees will be allowed to change their job preferences, and their partners will be able to identify those needed who want to work for a short time.
This expansion of time will reduce the work of planning and deployment that exists in the entire office.
We will inform the Board of our plan next week and receive a strong confirmation and inform the delegations and teams about the next action.
I am grateful to lead the team.
Office status, appearance and quality
Last week, we’ve been aware that a resident of our SF could be affected by COVID-19.
However, despite too much caution, we performed an in-virus operation at the office in San Francisco to clean all levels.
They used a hospital-level bacterial solution to remove each level of pain and to smooth the arms of the knees through which our four can be accessed.
This building uses its own protocol products that monitor the protection of its rental owners.
We feel calmly that the office will be fully ready at the time when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in the Wire, which has shared all the operating bodies of the DCFS and our COVID-19 protocols.
By the end of the week, our DCC office was on a round of long place, according to San Francisco’s six-common guidelines.
As we know about residents in this WCC, we are renting a place in Brooklyn.
It can be a delay, but it can be a delay.
Our friends work away for the first time.
Our flagship guests know what this is an idgestment and what advice you want to give.
The time of the meetings is more than one or two guests.
If you need long meetings, think about how to divide them in different days.
Make the meeting clear as each agency, and send the related materials first.
Create the video in default, which uses Google Docs and Zoom JC software for direct collaboration and contact.
Gain the advantage in providing collaboration for each meeting, someone should worry about the discussion of questions and follow the list of appointments and someone should help in taking a note (or not with collaboration).
If you need a relaxed headset, send an email to technical cooperation.
Use your farming and brother's compensation for sinics.
I am included in the #Remote Channel in Silk to talk about the work shared with your partners-
The HR operating team is considering the webinar-based aerogonomics leadership to cooperate in the work divided into the entire foundation.
Last week we told all the receivers of social surveys that it was the Wikipedia’s observed public reports, as it cancelled the edited, until the World Health Administration announced the end of this worldwide vacation.
They should be aware that we understand that our cancellation requests and other provisions are possible to complement their accepted cooperation activities and that there will be no obstacle to repair or slow down those objectives.
In the coming week we will work on additional guidance on Wikimania and other related and topical audio conferences.
The general feelings of the whole world brotherhood are insighted on this disorder except the clear ability to focus on their own brothers, Wikipedia, and others.
Growing forward, CERT is working on creating a web page on Wikipedia in order to give the community the opportunity to pursue their communications and worry about their effects.
Stay in contact with the transactions related to COVID-19.
We will invite your client to a special meeting next Friday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the latest information, answer your questions and how much time we will spend on contacting each other.
We are in it and we will help each other where we can.
During this time you can continue to obtain information from this email and other necessary information related to COVID-19 on the same Wikipedia.
This page will keep the latest and all the other information in one place.
We are working on the established relationships of those bodies of activity that are then residential in those countries that are sufficiently affected.
If you’re traveling, dating, having an important job, or curriculum, or anything else that needs you to help, you don’t demonstrate weakness in working and obtaining information.
We are here to provide cooperation and contact at the time needed.
If you have any secret or sensitive treatments, please send an e-mail to Crem Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No change of them should be seen as a disruption of our tasks and responsibilities.
Instead, there is a peak at this time, our work and responsibilities will need to be dissolved in a form that we have not seen in the past.
These are actions that we understand that it is necessary to help each other in order that we continue to work, to provide our stimulation and cooperation that it needs and to serve the world to which it is exclusive.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
After that, helping each other is a matter of time and giving us the opportunity for important work that will come in a few weeks but may come in a few months.
To do this we all need you, and therefore you all need to think about yourself and your family so that when necessary you are prepared in the best condition.
Now, praise your hands and look your faces!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda, EmiV, Brown J. Dourin, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel El, Lint El, Ryan, and Tony S), and the rest of the team (Grant I, Header Dublé), Jim V, Jenny U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan, and Toby S).
Injection 2 (ACE2) is an injection that is derived from the external level of the cells (cells) in the arteries, arteries, hearts, arteries and antennas.
ACE2 is a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease by reducing the levels of angiotinsone II and increasing the levels of angiotinsone (1-7). ACE2 acts as an internal point for coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is mostly called hACE2.
The enzyme that converts angiotinsin is a part of the 2 test that contains methalonzyme that is found on the level of the indothyyl and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains this terminal peptidas M2 domain and a Ctreminal Colictorn Rinal Amino Acid Transporter domain.
ACE2 is a cell-pass type I ignorant protein, whose bacteria and other roots are activated in the cell level.
Outside of the cells of ACE2, the domain is trans-membraned through another injection, the domain is called shedsis, and as a result the soluble protein is left in the bloodstream that is left out through the final function.
ACE2 is found in the most organs: ACE2 is essentially derived from the type II bacterial cells, small antenna intrus, arthyral and viral endotylic cells, and arthyral muscular lung cells.
The effect of ACE2MRNA also occurs in the brain's external ignorance, body diagram, from the lower to the lower to the lower to the lower to the lower to the lower to the lower to the lower.
The basic task of ACE2 is to work from the status of ACE’s counterbalance.
ACE IngytoTinsone I hormone is sufficient in the blood vessels of IngytoTinsone II.
Instead, the ACE2 carboxyl terminal separates the amino acid phinylinine from angiotinsine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and it is hydolysis and hydolithic angiotinsine (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 also separates several other peptides that include [DIS-Arg 9] -bridicine, epilen, neurothincine, dinorphen A, and gorilline.
ACE2 also controls the transmission and pregnancy of SLC6A19 carrying potent amino acids and is infected with cervical diseases.
From the status of protein trans ignorance, ACE2 acts as a central entry into the multiple coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2’s S1 protein cells on the level of ACE2’s enzymetic domain, the blocking of the cells to the intake of a cells cells cells, and causing the transfer of both viral and enzymetic cells.
In this procedure of intervention, the priority of Sprotein is also required through the representative serum prothesis TMPRSS2, whose rejection continues as a possible treatment under existing research. Some of it have concluded that by the amount of ACE2 levels in the cells, it can be easy to address the disease.
But many of the predecessors and organizations have advised the general A.C.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.
A regular review and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that “the use of the ACE barrier was less than 34% of the risk of mononia compared to control.”
Furthermore, the risk of symptom B was reduced in those patients who were treated with ACA disorder, who were at the highest risk of symptom B, especially those who had a heart attack and a heart attack.
The ACE obstacle is relatively small in the deaths associated with the sample, although the total risk of the sample was low in its results.”
Human transplantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is conducted as a new treatment for severe wounds of the spine, and it has been shown that it will improve the development of hemodynamics and oxygen with severe respiratory disorders.
In humans, half-life of rhACE2 is approximately 10 hours and, in addition to 24 hours of effect, action begins in 30 minutes.
Several findings show that rhACE2 is a better drug for persons who are hunted in the classical Rhine-Angiotinsin system disorder (RAS disorder). or in diseases where the circulation of angiotinsin II is excessive - during medical trials for severe respiration, rhACE2 has been diagnosed to be high.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile apps that help to interact during the 2019-20 World Wide Web, for example, the process of recognizing those people ("relationships") who have remained in the interact of someone affected.
From the cooperation of the official government, several such applications were built or prescribed in the authority of several districts and circles.
Several frameworks of appliances were prepared to try the connection.
Confidentiality errors have been revealed, especially in order to search for the geographical location of the IP user about this system.
The low-income exchange includes the use of Bluetooth signals so that the user's location and location are transferred to the other mobile phone.
Google and Apple jointly announced on 10 April 2020 that they will cooperate in linking applications based on this section to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Ali Pei, has built an IP that allows citizens to know if someone was in contact with a person affected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. in Singapore, it is the process of using the Trace Together name app.
This IP was built by an official IT brotherhood, which was released free of charge and will be transferred to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched a bluetooth-based IP called "Stop Corona!" which may be a sign of the close proximity of persons affected and will be able to provide immediate response to the authorities who look for health.
It was prepared by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Up to April 14, 2020, the SIP will be targeted by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government announced on April 12 that the relationship is in the next stage of the attempted IPTARY and will be reached for implementation within a week - the plan for the application of this section ("Stop Code") in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering the implementation of the application on the foundation of Singapore’s Trace Togider IP and Bluetooth Protocol—Russia has a willingness to establish a Geofinsing IP for diagnosed patients with COVID-19 residents in Moscow, in order to ensure that people don’t get out of their cravings.
Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, Ross Anderson, said that many possible practical problems in the systems on the base of the IP included wrong-positive results and the likelihood of low-effects.If the use of the application is limited to a small layer of population.
Removing erroneous or defective "coronavirus" appliances related errors, Apple has set a limit to which section settings include coronavirus appliances in its app store, limiting them to only "working" or otherwise known settings.
Google and Amazon look like the same.
The secret scientists have expressed their concerns about the precautions of concerns on the Corona virus app, especially about whether the precautions of concerns that the Corona virus has formed to counter the world will be eliminated after the end of this risk.
Security International and more than 100 other regulations have issued a statement calling to limit the regulations of concerns in this section.
The authorities have announced the five terms on government plans:
The concerns must be "legal, necessary and appropriate";
Request for a specific period of concerns and observations:
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19.
The protection of data and the name will not be disclosed and the protection on the basis of the evidence will be disclosed;
Digital concerns must be avoided from making excessive and non-important behavior;
The third person must clarify the data sharing under the law;
There will be protective measures against the multitudes and the citizens will have the right to respond to the multitudes.
All the "related partners" will be required by the intended company, including the experts of the PUBLIC HILTH and the non-important group. German KYOS COMPUTER CLUB (CCC) and the Non-Granties Nominator (Reporter Owen Greenzin) (RSF) also released concern lists.
Google/Apple’s licensing project from its operating system machine, when it is not necessary, is intended to solve the problem of independent concern by ending the workout method.
Which countries used the local concern system based on the networks instead of the IP, which ended both the need to download the application and the power to protect from concerns.
The system of concerns based on the networks in Israel was understood.
Network-based solutions, in which access to local net data is possible, are the most important issues of confidentiality.
Nevertheless, all relevant systems do not require access to local data at any time; multiple security reservation systems have been built to use central servers only for news (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system is used for linking.
Instead of using a best application, the system collects concerned information from various grounds, including the exchange of concerned data and data from cards in mobile devices, and by collecting all of them, prepares notes through text messages for the most likely affected persons.
In addition to the use of this information, the government has made public access to the location information in order to inform the possible relationships, which is what the permission of the information confidentiality law has been caused by distant changes when the MERS in that country has broken down.
This information is available to the public through multiple applications and websites – countries such as Germany have considered both central and confidentiality protection systems.
The details will not be published until April 6, 2020.
The concern of confidentiality-reserving interconnection is a better idea, in which research literature has a sufficient date less than 2013 until April 7, 2020, more than one degree of experts have worked on a friendly solution of confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth’s weak capacity (BLE) that makes the place of the user to be inside from the other mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a related effort that consists of both central and non-centric methods, and it is not an ecala protocol. In non-centric protocol: non-centric confidentiality reservation location concern (DP-PPT / DP-3T), contact number (TCN,fka unit contact number, CEN), sensitive confidentiality protocol and mobile contact method work (PACT) and others, include.
In this protocol, recognizable indigenous data will never be exhausted from the machine and will always be available to all users.
MIT Media Liberty’s Secretary Group is preparing such a secure line, which is a platform for collecting the data of the location or location for the connection of COVID-19 members and using the time of use of the secret protection technique.
This is based on the research by the Curtas Abid "IPS GON ROG: Sustainable Intellectual Status in the Web" which was released in March 2020. The second attempt of this kind is SIF TRIS PLATFORM by the IMPC, a company preparing secret technology that was originally established in the IMIT Media League.
CEF TRIS uses the secure hardware to allow consumers to share sensitive and accurate data with other customers and visitors, without any understanding of the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the Foundation of the World Trade Union (WTC) was a group of groups who had been trained for this purpose who had the same point of view and who were violating the protocol on large-scale, that the publication will be reduced so that concerns and concerns will be activated globally, which is the key element of achieving an agreement on large-scale.
On April 9, 2020 the government of Singapore announced that the application, the blueberry application, which was used by its government, was released.
On 10 April 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform control companies, Google and Apple, announced an action for the link of contact, in which, according to their claims, the confidentiality will be saved, based on the disadvantaged Bluetooth energy technology and safeguard confidentiality.
He also published the original technology statements used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
The applicable governments of this Protocol shall be able to make it possible to implement the official safeguard of confidentiality applications of the Coronavirus efforts.
Google and Apple are willing to solve the problems of their independent concern through the right integration of this activity to iOS and Android that the first system will be divided through the updates of the operating system, and then it will be removed in the same way when the risk is over.
The conversion of the drug (the conversion of the purpose of the drug, the re-profile building, the job change or the treatment change) is the conversion or use of the drug intended for the treatment of a disease other than that of the drug that will be used for the disease for which it is prepared in principle.
This is an online clinical study that is currently ongoing for the study of the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19.
Other aspects of the study include COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transmission. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 medicable proteins, each of which has multiple salivation sites.
These screening sites provide an appropriate plan for preparing effective anti-viral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most common target of SARS-CoV-2 is popin in protein, as RNA is unique in RNA polymeris, helix, S protein and ADP ribofasphite, protein.
Hussein A.A., Ital has been modified and analyzed with the highest intended medications for the comparison of their disorders after the study of several hopeful substances so that it has been prescribed in the medical study designs to accelerate the appearance of a strong blocked SARS-CoV-2 drug in its pre-medical study.
Chlorokin is an inhibited millaria drug that is used for multiple automatic defensive diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Department announced that chlorokin and its hydrochlorokin will be included in the four medications that will be studied in single medical experiments.
New York's Governor Indrio Kumo announced that New York's official experiments on chlorokin and hydrooxyclorokin will begin from March 24. On March 28, E.F.D. has authorized the use of hydrooxyclorokin selfite and chlorokin fosfite under a restrictive use permit (e.U.A.)
The method of medical experiments by the FDA has not been intended for this treatment in the work and under the FDA only the patients who are in the hospital are allowed to use the treatment without any medical experiment.
CDC said that "the use of hydroxy chlorokin, the amount of food, or the period of time for the treatment of prophylacysis or SARS-CoV-2 disease" has not yet been determined.
Doctors say they use this medicine when "no one and power remains."
A Turkish research group in Istanbul conducted a brief study of the use of chlorokin in the shares of Zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin D.
Great studies are ongoing at the Duke University and Oxford University.
This Wii U Longon Medical School has an experiment on the protection and effectiveness of precautionary use of hydrochlorokine.
Experiments from China in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Fawipiravir was "evidently" effective.
In Shenzhen, 35 patients were negative in an average of 4 days, while in those 45 patients the period of the disease was 11 days less than those who did not take a single drug.
In a study conducted on 240 patients in Wuhan, half of the patients had phavipiravir and half of the patients had humifinavir.
The Atalanta Drug Agency reminded the people that there are very few evidence in support of this drug.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will buy the drug from Japan for its reserves, and will use it through the army in the university’s hospitals, where it will be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
According to South China's Marning Post, Shinzo Abe is a major concern over Trump's administration about the purchase of this drug - this drug is less likely to be effective in cases of severe diseases where the virus has already grown.
It may not be protected for pregnant women or those trying to be pregnant.
A study of Lupinavir/Ritnauer (Clitra), which is a combination of Inti-Viral Lupinavir and Ritnauer, has concluded that it has "no seen any benefits".
These medications were designed in such a way that prevent HIV from transmitting by stagnating the prothesis.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to react in drugs to detect such a compound that will be depleted with the SARS-CoV-2 protein. There are controversial claims on redirecting the means to re-preparing drugs, especially about the drugs prepared for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Department has included Lupinavir/Ritnauer in the International We Health Test.
Remediciveir's Glide Science has promoted and promoted the prevention of Ebola virus disease and the treatment of Marberg virus diseases - its subsequent Glide Science has immediately found that in the remediciveir there is multiple viral entertainment against the phylos, phimosis, paramicosis and corona viruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is promoting disorder through changes that can cause more severe diseases and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies prescribe that the remediator may have a high genetic disorder. Many of these medical tests, including two Cleveland University Hospital’s supervision; a low-sick and a second-large-sick people, include.
For patients with COVID-19K disease and severe patients who are hospitalized, three medical trials in the veins of COVID were conducted; two relievers were controlled (China, China) and one without control (Talvia).
The President of New York began the test of the Uthromycin Inti Biotech on 24 March 2020.

In April it was said that the necessary steps of the CEP for the WikiLeaks are sharp, the competence of the preparers, the definitions on large contracts and the global access rate.
In April, CEPI scientists that at the beginning of 2020 10 different technology platforms are in research and development in order to provide an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I’s safeguard studies include several major platform targets:
Newclic acid (DNA and RNA) (Fize I preparers and Viksin hope: Moderna, MRNA -1273)
Viral Vector (Producers of Phase I and Vixin Hope: Can Sinus Biology, Edino Virus Type 5 Vector)
As CEPI scientists in April, a total of VICSIN's 115 hopes are in the early stages of VICSIN's production, 78 are certified as active projects (79, according to Milan Institute Twitter), and other 37 have announced unless there is very little public information available about them (this is supposed to be in the planning phase or to be subjects of aquatic design).
Phase I-II experiments are primary protection and immunity criteria, generally controlled by unregulated, harmful substances of the drug, and occur on multiple sites, while more accurate, determining effective foods.
Phase III experiments generally include more partners, including a control group, and the effects of the drug for the prevention of disease, while more concerns about the harmful effects on food.
Of the 79 expectations of Viksin in active study (certified until the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet identifiable in humans (also in "pre-medical" research).

At the end of March, the Kenya government announced a financial cooperation of 275 million Chinese dollars for 96 research projects on COVID-19 blocked response medical transactions, which included several hopes of Viksin in the actions of the Kenya companies and universities, such as Midicago and the University of Scotland.
Almost at the same time, the government of Kenya announced a private $192 million for the production of the COVID-19 VICSIN, in which several of the new VICSIN planned the rebellion of a ethnic "VICSIN BANK" that will be used when any other aircraft dropped from the Coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Peter's Tower School of Medicine University the experiments on petechrome, which may have a possible COVID-19 virus in the crops, saying that "MNA revealed a strong reaction of the injection-related injection by the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spinach virus [in the crops] which appeared clearly 2 weeks after the vaccine occurred."
On 16 April 2020 in Kenya, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the possibility of designing a vaccine based on DNA as a shield.
Using bacteriophysis, the DNA will be designed to transport harmless viral particles within the human bacteria, which strengthens the anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-intestinal defense system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered the means to make access to IBM’s supercomputers, which will be gathered together with the means of HYLOUT PICRED INTERPRESSES, AMAZON, MICROSOFT and Google’s CLOOD COMPOTING.
Some vaccines have different effects, which are also called unusual effects.
It means that they may have the benefits of this disease and the benefits of which they want to save.
In Australia, 4,170 medical examinations were conducted for an unregulated trial.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be saved or spread during the stage of the vaccine.
Primary research to enhance the probability of the vaccine by using the specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-Donsley Sheep, other livestock animals and non-human high creatures, bio-reservation level 3 maintenance measures, and standard conservation methods, indicate the need for international consensus to ensure the work.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been experimented in non-human animal models.
Until 2020, SARS has not received any protective vaccines or treatments that are safe and effective in humans.
According to a published research article in 2005 and 2006, the recognition and distribution of null vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is preferred by the world’s governments and public authorities.
When MERS was examined, it is thought that the research of existing SARS will be an effective sample in the treatment and treatment of MERS-CoV disease.
By March 2020, a MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that has completed phase I medical experiments on humans and three other current vaccines, all of which are vaccinated viral vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine.
Social media posts have launched a coordination theory that the virus of COVID-19 is known and its viruses are already available.
In various social media posts revealed that the existing genetic series and viruses in the patents are referred to by the other trees of the patents and coronavirus as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multiple disease that causes severe respiratory disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
General signs include steam, gains and respiratory disorders.
Other symptoms include swelling, pain in the legs, swelling, burning in the throat, end of the feeling of swelling and pain in the foot.
From appearance to the beginning of the liqueur signs, it usually takes five days unless it can last up to two days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are of ordinary quality, the viral symptoms and organs fail.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million events from 210 districts and districts have been, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are face-to-face vulnerable – essentially this virus is affected by people from close contact among the people, most of them in the form of corneal bonds when speaking, speaking, or speaking.
Although the same bonds come out when breathing out, but most of them are rough on the ground or roof, instead of the long distance of the disease.
What is the cause of the sickness, or the sickness, or the sickness, or the sickness, or the sickness?
This virus can survive up to 72 ghosts on the levels.
Within three days before the start of the symptoms, this is the most common disease, although it is possible to occur in the phases before and after the symptoms. The standard method of its diagnosis is when the reverse transcript polymeric reaction (rRT-PCR) occurs.
The use of the mask is advised to those who are similar to those affected by the virus and those who are healthy.
There are differences in the prescription to wear a mask for the general people, who are opposed to the use of it, who advise the use of it and who make it necessary.
At this time, there is no vaccine or any specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded the local transmission of this disease in the most countries of the world.
Symptoms may not be apparent in persons affected by the virus, or they may show signs such as evaporation, gains, swelling and breathing difficulties.
The symptoms include breathing difficulties, frequent pain or pain in the chest, heartbeat, difficulty swallowing, and face or headaches; if these symptoms are present, it is advised to take immediate medical assistance.
In the top of the breath, the symptoms of the disease can be seen, such as swelling, nausea or flower burning.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as methyl, bacterium and bacterium were observed in different percentages.
In China, in the beginning, a number of events occurred only in the hardness of the cinema and the hardness of the city.
In what circumstances this disease is a symptom, the failure of too many members and the path of death.
It is called an incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is generally five to four days except for two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms of the disease will be affected within 11.5 days.
Without the symptoms, the symptoms of those affected people are not even fully known; however, the initial evidence shows that this disease may be removed.
The proportion of people affected by this disease is unknown at the moment in which the symptoms are not present and they are studied quickly, where the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has that 20% of all transactions confirmed during the rise in the hospital are without symptoms.
The National Health Commission of China began counting non-signal events in its daily transactions from 1 April; on that day, 130 (78%) of the 166 influential patients were not-signal during the test time.
It is possible that both of them will be overwhelmed and overwhelmed.
There is a lot of talk about the song.
A study in Singapore found that the capacity to go up to 4.5 meters (15 ft) in the band of the Dhanpa galaxy was unable.
Although this is not a virus, the National Academy of Sciences has prescribed that bioresol is possible to be transmitted and that the samples of viral RNA were positive in those who were present in the Dalan outside the people's chambers.
Some medical methods of work such as anatomy and cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (CPRs) can erosolate the breathing moisture and, as a result, spread into the air.
Now, while the disadvantages are that it is spread from the spectrum, this risk is understood.When the symptoms appear in people, the virus is the most common; and if the virus is possible to spread before the symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not completely clear how easily the disease is spreading, one person generally affects two to three people.
Specifically, one day on the virus, plastic (Polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) came to work up to three days, and 99% of the tubes came to work up to four hours.
However, it does not change in terms of temperature.
If soap and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products disable the anti-viral protective system, with which they clean the virus from rapid and other levels.
The other solution, hydrogen benzoconium chloride and chlorohydine gluconite (a surgical bacterium agent) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, the sample was given in the middle of two days of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the most viral load was observed in the first sample, and in six patients the most viral load was observed in the second day test.
The manifestation of symptoms of severe respiratory disorders is coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe respiratory disease coronavirus, which was first observed in three people with symptoms of severe respiratory diseases.
All the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus related to nature.
Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by the soap, which protects its proteins. SARS-CoV-2 principle is similar to SARS-CoV.
The tubes are the members that are most affected by COVID-19 because through the viral angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) they get access to the host cells, which are most affected in the cells of the type II of tubes.
The virus uses a specific level of sugar milk called "Cyl" (Piplomer) to spread from ACE2 and enters the host cell.
12% of people who entered a hospital in Wuhan, China, had severe heart injuries and serious illness.
The heart symptoms are more described due to the disease of the defensive system during the period of inflammation and inflammation in the whole body, but the severe heart muscle cartilage may also be associated with ACE2 connectors.
2ACE are more visible in the heart and they are included in the action of the heart.
Patients of the COVID-19-affected extreme preservative unit saw more events of arterial blood clot (31%) and thromboombolism (25%) and could be associated with a bad diagnosis. COVID-19-related patients saw post-marthm-related depth-related damage (DAD) and inflammatory inflammation.
Although SARS-COV-2 occurs for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory cells, COVID-19 has more symptoms of burning than usual in severe patients affected by the body.
Specifically, the patient ISM-CIF secreting T-cells were shown to be dependent on the use of an inflammatory IEL-6 cells in patients affected by COVID-19 and severe inflammatory diseases.
Post Martm is the time of the interference of the Gulf Gulf.
The WHO has published several methods of treatment of the disease.
The standard method of experience is the RRT-PCR (Royal Transcription Polymes China Rection) on working time.
The test is generally done on the breath moisture patterns resulting from the created anaphylactic path; the patterns may also be used for the use of the patterns, the patterns or the patterns of the patterns.
The results are generally achieved within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples in two weeks and the immediate importance of the results is less important.
Chinese scientist Coronawa has managed to identify a part of herpes and published the genetic order to prepare the polymeric series reaction (PCR) for the detection of multiple diseases that freely occur from herpes throughout the world.
Until April 4, 2020, the IntiBased Test (which identifies active multiple diseases and whether any person has been affected in the past or not) was in the stage, but has not yet been used for widespread mediation.
Chang’s Chinese experience showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The first test center for use in the U.S. at the end of the month was scheduled for 21 March 2020. The Wuhan University’s Wuhan Hospital has issued diagnostic instructions taking into account the medical characteristics and web hazards for the Wuhan University’s Wuhan.
In primary multiple diseases, two-party multiple houses, green glass opicites are commonly divided into unsuitable, unsuitable, and subsequently divided.
As a disease of age, complete overcoming, cries may appear (such as headaches can be altered) and strength may appear.
COVID-19 has some statistics about the nutrition and phytophysology.
The most important symptoms of postmortem are:
Microscopy: the burning of the spine, the burning of the cover heart, the strength of the spine and the burning of the spine.
There are four kinds of viral samples:
Helca patterns: with the formation of a large, unusual neomosite, a large, unusual neomosite, a spectacular burning and a multi-powerful dwarf coating coating coating.
It is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
The appearance of signs of severe respiratory disorders (ARD) and a severe amount of oxygen in the body.
The sample must be filled: the regulation of throwing out in the olive and polmonary backs
Blood: the blood flow in the vessels (DIC), the reaction of white and red blood.
Precautionary measures to reduce the possibilities of illness include staying at home, escaping from wooden places, washing the load of the hand with soap and water and washing for less than 20 seconds, keeping the breath better healthy and running the eyes, nails or mushrooms from the handless hands.
The CDC prescribes the use of cranes or cranes when it comes to cranes and cranes, and if cranes are not achieved, it prescribes the use of the part within cranes.
It is recommended to use the right hand for the use of the right hand for the use of the right hand for the use of the right hand.
The CDC has prescribed the use of clothes to lay down the mouth in the mountain, in order to limit the transmission of the virus from people who do not show signs. The purpose of the wisdom practices of social distance is to close the schools and offices, to stop travel arrangements and to delay large public meetings, to reduce contact with the large group of affected people.
The directional name of the distance includes living at a distance of less than 6 feet (1.8 meters).
There was no effective treatment for the blockade of COVID-19. Since the vaccine was not expected until 2021, a key point of the COVID-19 estimate is to reduce the highest level of the vaccine that is called "flighting".
CDC also prescribes people to wash their hands loaded with soap and water for up to 20 seconds, especially after eating or when their hands appear to be dirty, before eating and after cleansing, swallowing or scratching.
It also prescribes that less than 60% of hand-based synthesizers will be used, but only when soap and water are not easily accessible. In those areas where commercial hand-based synthesizers are not easily accessible, the WHO forms two formulas for local findings.
In these formations, it is found from entertainment, ethinol and isoprophenol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help end the bacteria’s eggs; “this is not an active substance for bacteria in the hands.”
Glycerol is absorbed as a moisturizer.
People have been organized with non-support, which includes fluid treatment, oxygen-help linen, and other important effects of organ support.
CDC has prescribed that people who suspect they are influenced by the virus wear a simple mask.
In the breath, non-masted oxygen (eCMO) is used to solve the corneal methyl in the breath, but its benefits are now considered.
Indigenous preservatives are prescribed to bring a lot in health and a healthy lifestyle and better food strength defence.
The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have issued orders for hospitalization with COVID-19.
In the U.S. doctors and doctors of patients have arranged the treatment from various agencies for a free means, in the IBC.
By April 2020, there was no special treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical specialists prescribe presetamol (mesithaminofen) as an important drug in place of ibuprophin.
Precautionary measures are necessary to reduce the risk of viral infections, especially in the medical environment when such medical action occurs, resulting in an injection or hand-to-hand infection.
For medical procedures that prevent people affected by COVID-19, the CDC also prescribes to keep the person in the Airborne Infection Room (AIIR) in addition to general precautions, contact precautions and precautions for bacteria found in the air. The CDC sets out the guidelines for the use of Indigenous Protection Mechanisms (PPE) during the World Wide Web.
The prescribed mechanisms are: PPA, respiratory or face mask, eye protector, and medical hands. When respiratory is available, it is preferred (not face mask).
This 95 machine breathing is intended for industrial environment, but the FDA has permitted the mask to be used only under the permission of use.
They are prepared to protect against particles found in the air, such as dust, but they do not guarantee the effect of use against any specific unintended vital agent.
When the mask is not available, the CDC prescribes to use the face mask or home mask as the last mask.
The majority of people affected by COVID-19 aren’t so disturbed that they need mechanical ventilation or exchanges, but some percentage of patients need it.
COVID-19 has been actively studied on the Department of Respiratory Cooperation in people who entered the respiratory failure hospital, with some evidence that high-flowing nails can be treated from the input nails with high-flowing nails or bilateral positive games.
It is not known that both of these serious patients are beneficial to one.
Some doctors prefer sickness when achieved because this method is working to limit the flow of atmospheric particles in comparison to high fluid nausea. severe disease is more common in older adults (those who are over 60 years old and especially those who are over 80 years old).
In developed countries there is no level of supply available, which restricts the ability to treat the increased number of people affected by COVID-19 in the health system who need to be hospitalized.
According to one study, it was found that 5% in China were entered into the extremist units, 2.3% needed mixed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people affected by COVID-19 are transferred to the ultimate work unit.
Mechanical ventilation is more complicated because COVID-19 increases severe respiratory disorders (RDS) and oxigenes become more difficult.
The waterproof mode and the unchip-EP-capable ventilators are needed to reduce the risk of increased oxygen threshold and ventilators to reduce the risk of an atmospheric accumulation.
There will be no more PEPs available on the floating windows.
Research for possible treatment was started in January 2020, and several inches were in the stage of medical experiments.
Remedies seem to be the most hopeful.
Although new medications may take time until 2021, many of the medications that are experienced are already intended for use or are already in the new phase of experimentation.
Patients with severe illness should be tested with anti-viral medications.
WHO prescribes to consultants to participate in possible therapeutic effects and protection experiments.The FDA has permitted artificially healed people’s plasma to be experimentally used in cases where a person’s life is measured or immediately at risk.
This disease does not prove itself safe and effective from medical studies.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the disease.
The customer will be asked to enter his name and identification number.
It can identify the "approximate connection" using the number and number of concerns and therefore reduce the possible risk of infection.
Each customer can also see the three other customers’ status.
If the risk is noticed, the IP does not only prescribe self-determination, it also takes attention to local medical visitors. The affected persons and those who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore use mobile phone data, face-to-face technology, mobile phone tracking and large-scale scores on artificial minds to identify.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the data of those people who should be coronavirus.
This is the way to protect and protect those affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the number of mobile phones collected with the German government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and identify the viruses.
Russia has established a technology that recognizes the faces of the curtains.
The Telecommunications Health Organization said that the mobile phone operators have informed them that "40% of people are going back."
The German government held a 48-hour meeting in the weekend with 42,000 hopes.
Estonian President Christy Kagolaud also spoke on the international level to advocate a resolution against the coronavirus conflict.
It may be that individuals have trouble due to cardiac, travel interruptions, harmful effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
The BBC said, referring to Rory and Conor, “Additional mental disturbance, humidity, health disorders, mental disorders and sexual disorders are a complete disorder for mental health and happiness of people.”
The disease is a risk of any or no symptoms, which is similar to the second year of respiratory diseases, such as general steam.
Generally, the patient can be healed within two weeks, while the patient with severe or severe diseases can be healed within three to six weeks.
Based on the numbers of other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at severe risk than COVID-19, but the numbers of COVID-19 are not achieved.
In severe people affected, COVID-19 may be converted into rapidly severe respiratory disease (or RDS), which may cause failure in breathing, body stroke or multiple organs failure.
Complications derived from COVID-19 include damage to the body’s pathways, the abnormal blood group and the heart, circles and liver.
In the abnormal blood group, in 6% of COVID-19 patients, the periodic excess of blood muscle growth was observed, while in 4% of this group patients, the failure to function as usual.
About 20-30% of people affected by COVID-19 showed an excessive amount of liver fat (tranaminesis).
According to the same document, the time between the start and death of the signs was ten days, five of which were hospitalized for five days.
Of course, the average time of death in patients transferred to the extremely unnoticed unit was seven days.
In a study of primary patients, the average period from the appearance of the primary signs to the death of Lyker was 14 days, while the complete series was six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (ICC), the number of deaths in men was 2.8% while the number of deaths in women was 1.7%
After the death of the puppies from the medical examination in the puppies for the existence of the air in the puppies, the small tissue was caused by the resin of the domestic fibromyzoid.
Changes related to the disease of the living virus cells have been observed in the Neumito cysts.
The image of the pairs is similar to the signs of severe breathing trouble (ARDC).
According to China’s National Healthi Committee, 11.8 percent of deaths were caused by trauma or movement heart levels rise.
According to the U.S. President's March figures, 89% of hospitalized patients have already had some illnesses.
Relationship changes describe the size of death is different, but this method may also be due to problems in the work.
The low rate of illness can describe the number of deaths.
Of course, the fact that these deaths are the result of the diseases that previously suffered from it, means that the existing description of the deaths is less likely.
The appearance of severe signs of COVID-19 in smokers was 1.4 times greater and the need for extreme negligence or description was 2.4 times greater compared to those who did not smoke.
The Hong Kong Hospital’s supervisory authority looked at a decrease of 20% to 30% in the capacity of the infants in some people treated by the disease, and the infants’ examinations indicated the loss of the members.
This may cause the appearance of extremely unprecedented signs after the reporting.
Until March 2020, it was unknown that it was a long-term defense force in people who suffered from past web disease.
The strength of defence on the basis of the other coronavirus dreams is likely to be seen, but there are also prejudices in which the positive results of the coronavirus will again appear after interview with COVID-19.
These transactions are thought to be worse due to long-lasting multiple diseases instead of multiple diseases.
This virus is thought to be a power and its beginning was from animals to multiple diseases.
Its original source is unknown, but until December 2019, the prevalence of web disease was almost completely transmitted from human to human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed events of COVID-19, which was published in Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first events of the appearance of signs were on 1 December 2019.
The World Health Organization (WHO) official reports that 8 December 2019 was the first date of the start of the disease.
A number of measures are generally taken to determine the deaths of surgeons.
These numbers continue to change by line and time and influence the number of testing, the standard of health system, the treatment powers, the time and population characteristics from the beginning to the beginning, such as life, sex and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the Code of ICD-10 diseases U07.1 to deaths from SARS-CoV-2, certified by liberty, and the Code of medical or web deaths from COVID-19 without the certification of SARS-CoV-2 diseases from liberty to U07.2.
According to John Hopkins University’s figures, the global death and incident ratio by April 17th 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the description of deaths (CFR), which photographs the percentage of deaths in certified persons, and the web description of deaths (IFR) photographs the percentage of deaths in the most affected persons (certified and uncertified).
These numbers do not cover any particular time and a particular population until the solution of the illness treatment.
Although not all affected persons have an antibody appearance, the presence of antibody is the risk of providing this information about how many people have been affected.
A small village with 4600 inhabitants in the center of WBA in Italy, the castles of D'Ada of which 80 (1.7%) people are already dead.
In Ganglet, the disease spread to young people due to the deaths of the Catholic Christians, which caused the description of deaths to be relatively low, and it is not necessary that all deaths from COVID-19 were not classified in this way.
Moreover, the German health system was not defeated.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of patients may have an antibodies, as estimated by blood donors.
69 ( 0.004%) of people may be confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The influence and description of the world’s wives in men and women are different.
Studies conducted in China and Italy described more deaths among men.
The highest risk in men is after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at only 90.
In China, the number of deaths in men was 2.8 percent and in women 1.7 percent.
The cause of this sexual difference is unknown, but genetic and occurring factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological changes, the low use of tuberculosis in women and men, and the prevalence of other diseases compared to women in men, such as low-age hypertension, may lead to an increase in described deaths in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people affected were men and 72% of the people dying from COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government will not drop the COVID-19 HIV-related number.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have contained effects on men and women.
More than a percentage of medical processes are infected women, and they are more likely to be affected by the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the disease was officially named “COVID-19”.
WHO’s Chairman TITDROS EDHANUM GRIBISS explained CO from Corona, VI to Virus, D to Disease, and from 19 to the day when the first incident was charted: 31 December 2019.
This name has been selected to protect from any specific geographical location (such as China), animal section, or group of people, taking into account the international orders to prevent the disease. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named the apparent coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of the signs of severe respiratory disease.
WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in public lines and books.
Both diseases and viruses are generally referred to as coronavirus.
During the early epilepsy of Wuhan, China, both viruses and diseases are generally called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, according to the 2015 guidelines, the WHO prescribed nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as the virus and disease transit names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of the capacity of the standship chines, some digital manufacturers are working on medical mechanisms such as the rolling in the neck and the wintillator.
In one example, when an athletic hospital needed a ventilator wave, and the seller did not provide at the desired time, a local officer prepared it to build the desired 100 wave at night by preparing it.
After the initial follow-up of COVID-19, reconciliation theories, misinformation and misconceptions on the beginning, period, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread and rapidly spread to the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus into other animals.
This study failed to identify the signs of viral signs in mountains, cattle and birds.
There is no medicine or vaccine for the treatment of the disease.
Official regulations, educational group and industry researchers are ongoing research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "second experiment" to evaluate the effects of treatment from the four most prevalent in-viral compounds.
No Vixin is available, but various agencies are actively preparing the hopes of Vixin.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same source to enter the ACE2 human cells.
The trial of the trial of the trial of the trial.
First, the researchers are intended to prepare the vaccine for the entire virus.
The use of the virus, whether it is inactive or dead, provides an immediate defense force in the human body against the new disease of COVID-19.
A second wisdom practice, the underlying part of the virus, whose purpose is to prepare such a virus to find sensitivity to some underlying components of the virus in the main defence system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research center is the S-Speak Protein, which helps the virus enter the enzyme entrance of ACE2.
Thesis wisdom practical thesis thesis vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, the null method of preparing vaccine).
The experiments prepared by these wisdom practices will be reviewed for the preservation and awareness of Vixin – the first medical test of Vixin began on 16 March 2020 at four consultants in Seattle.
The vaccine contains the harmless criminal code that is transmitted by the virus that causes the disease. SARS-CoV-2 may have been prescribed to an exclusive aging on the intramuscular body in the vaccine treatment, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active medical experiments are ongoing by April 2020.
Seven experiments accompany this drug that is a previously intended treatment for millaria, including four studies of hydroxy chlorokin or chlorokin.
The majority of Chinese research consists of re-prescribed antiviral medication, reporting new experiences of phase III on remedies in several countries until the end of April.
Up to April 2020, COVID-19’s vaccine has been launched in the animated evaluation process for the hopes for its use. There are several existing anti-viral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remedium, chlorokin and hydro-oxy chlorokin, lupinavir/retnoir and lupinavir/retnoir that have been combined with interferon beta.
Up to March 2020, there will be an extraordinary warranty of notification from Remedies.
Patients who are treating with low use of remedium are considered a lot of medicine.
Phase III medical experiments are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokine, which was previously used for the treatment of millaria, was studied on it with initial results in February 2020.
Of course, the researchers have been calling for the reward.
The medical authorities in Korea and China have prescribed the use of chlorokin.
Of course, Wuhan Institute Tweet is suitable, although they order one gram of food a day, but notes that the double dose of the drug may be dangerous and mild.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a license for the treatment of COVID-19 patients for their proper hydrochlorone and chlorokine. The 7th edition Guidelines of China contains interferon, ribavirin or omifinoir in the drugs used against COVID-19.
Initial figures indicate that more amounts of rubavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within a living amount.
The research has shown that it is necessary to introduce in SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors through trans-membrane prothesis serin 2 (TMPRSS2).
Chlorocine and hydroxy chlorocine with or without isithromycin studies have great consequences resulting from receiving this treatment without further study of the medical class. OZLATAMOR does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 and does not have any famous role in the treatment of OVID-19.
In the following stages of severe COVID-19, cytokine sthroma may be a complication.
There are evidence that hydroxy chlorocyline is the peculiarity of the cytrus. After completing a brief study, Tucillizomab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission.
After the positive results appear in people with severe illness, the phase 2 on ethnic level in Italy passes the random test.
The common serum phyreton blood test is to recognize the bacterial syndrome, its aim is to face the progress of this type, which is considered the cause of death in some affected persons.
In 2017 for the treatment of the Steroid Refriction Sytoquin Release Disease that is derived from a different cause, namely the CAA RTT treatment, the FDA was referring to the opponent of MISANTERLYOKIN 6 RECEPTOR on the foundation of studies based on past estimates.
Until now, there is no unregulated, possible proof that Tosilygomab is an effective treatment against CRS.
The COVID-19 is prepared through the defensive system of people who are healed from the disease, a smooth and concrete antibodium, which is researched as an inactive antibodium of an inactive vaccine to those who need it.
This wisdom was tested with uncertain results for SARS.
Viral neutralization is a predictable method of work that can cause an inactive antibody treatment to defend against SARS-CoV-2.
Certainly other methods of work, such as unique cellular cytotoxicity and / or fgositosis on the intestinal body, may be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibodies treatment, for example, the use of assisted monoclonal antibodies, work on.
The foundations of soft substances, which are a liquid part of the patient’s blood and are contained in the specific antibodies of this virus, are prepared for rapid use.
Diseases of coronavirus, nearby and associated syndromes group
A doctor from the central hospital of Wuhan, Lee Wen Ling, was affected after awakening the feeling of the virus's cell and died due to COVID-19.
