The black box in your car?
As American highway designers scramble to find money to fix a crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car's dashboard.
Devices that track every mile driven by a motorist and relay that information to law enforcement are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and the National Planning Administration to overhaul the outdated system of funding America's highways.
The usually fading design of the highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the creation of various associations.
Libertarians have been meeting with environmental groups and lobbying for the government to use these little boxes that would record your miles and maybe even where you're going and then use that information to compile a tax return.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, some states are waiting for nothing.
They're looking at how they can move to a system where the driver pays per mile of road they drive within the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken their black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of choosing too much", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Governments, which plans to start tracking the mileage of every California motorist by 2025.
It's going to change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
The stimulus is the fact that the Highway Trust Fund funded by taxes Americans pay at gas stations is bottoming out.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars will go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't increased in 20 years.
With gasoline so high, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by even a single cent.
"A gasoline tax is simply not sustainable", said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this pay-per-mile system.
"In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative", he said.
Experts call it a mileage user fee.
Not surprisingly, this idea is popular with urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners look to this system to plan strategies to meet the goals set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates at the Reason Foundation also favor the idea of paying drivers for miles driven.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who in 2011 urged Congress to move toward pay-per-mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that was supposed to involve about 10,000 cars.
The House leadership, however, rejected the proposal, doing so because of concerns among rural lawmakers representing a segment of the population whose daily lives often involve traveling many miles to work outside the city.
However, a few states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The most active is Oregon, which has conducted the largest experiment in the country involving 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon be paying the state mileage tax instead of the gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently investigating the project.
Illinois is doing that to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation, along with the east coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
But this concept has not only supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned about the government's ability to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother-type surveillance and similar issues have been a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project proceeded, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website: It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to recording the daily comings and goings of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that is trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car drives, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some government agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the government's tax relief effort.
It wanted to break into the emerging market for liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drove.
But the device they are testing has caught the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded by a modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't track their speed and their location", says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these pilot programmes have shown a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a GPS-enabled device or a non-GPS device.
Or they may not need to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average mileage of all the residents of the state.
Elsewhere, they hope that a cautious public will embrace the concept as the device does more, not less.
In New York City, transit officials are working to develop a taxing system that would be equipped to pay additional parking fees, provide insurance based on miles driven, and collect speed data from other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered, says the city's projection document.
Some transportation designers, however, wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is just a giant sub-problem.
Officials at the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission say Congress could very easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not use much fuel, so that they pay a fair share.
"No radical surgery is needed if you take a lot of aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, chairman of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will have to worry about their privacy and a whole bunch of other things.
The CCSD is being negotiated by Sobotka.
Social democracy is being played, populists and Bábish talk to each other and plan a joint course.
If the Social Democrats lose their minds within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly matched partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD deputies will either swallow the sour grapes of the coalition or they will nod to the wobbly minority government.
After four days of being carried on a wave of sympathy, Bohuslav Sobotka has hit the ground running.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political board and, most importantly, to force convicted liars to resign.
He's the only confirmed party negotiator, and the rest of the team won't be allowed in until after a key Central Executive Committee meeting.
I apologized to the members of the guild and now to the citizens.
You don't lie, in private or in public.
"It was a mistake", said Michal Hašek after a meeting of the Social Democracy's top leadership.
He added that he doesn't work as first vice president.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the Central Intelligence Agency", said Hashek.
The vice-chairman of the Czech Socialist Party Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc spoke similarly.
He did point out, however, that he had been elected only two days earlier.
The two members then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the fifty-member club of the ČSSD sounded with one voice.
The absurd theater was crowned by Michal Hašek with the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party organs".
Which means another lie on the air.
Or did he forget that the August meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (VVS) decided 57% that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
But the head of the CPSU, by calling the Central Intelligence Agency, has created a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with a barrage of gossip and rumors, possibly reminding them of the real failures of Sobotka's political career.
There will be a fierce laundry fight, signs of dark alliances between the coal baron Zdenek Bakal and the Saturday Wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorny will be discussed.
They cause disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
Warning words are spoken by Ostrava mayor and Sobotkov ally Peter Kajnar: "I signed Charter 77 so that idiots would not rule the country".
If the C.I.A. had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will scatter the ashes over their heads and stay.
And the current winning leader of the CPSU will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with the OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth suggest a slight smile, and then he takes a deep breath: "It's hard".
Working with the Sochi 2014 Olympic organizing team is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same", claims the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and less accurately.
It's so confusing.
They're relatively fast in terms of invoices, not so fast in terms of delivering information on the essentials.
For three months now, we've been asking them to give us the official name of each village so we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating with the thing.
They're still communicating on a lot of things.
Is the Olympic village even finished yet?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What do you mean, they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just the base concrete, so that's how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a vanguard, it's still gonna smell like glue.
And if they don't make it, what happens?
You think President Putin would send an army there?
I guess that's what's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Village = the Twilight Village.
They're more likely to miss things like road repairs, not getting the details right.
They may have their roads in such a state that we'll have to bring sticks from the London Games.
But I believe they'll sort it out.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although this number varies according to the nomination criteria.
Maybe the skaters are gonna ride in the trio that just left.
There's no doubt about speed skater Martina Sablikova, but other than that, it's a work in progress.
You still have a trip to Sochi?
No, unless something happens, I'm not supposed to be there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves with the subway so we wouldn't just believe the blueprints.
We're also preparing a whole host of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do 100 days before the Olympics?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of the individual Olympic sports, plus I'm running a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, his plan is a giant secret landfill
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter before the opening of the Sochi Olympics, while others are looking at the preparations with growing concern.
The Russian Olympics, even though they don't start until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to keep their promise that the preparations and the games will not in the least disrupt the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors are headed in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had raised the bar very high, and the Canadian Games went down in Olympic history as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to the zero-waste games has long since been fulfilled.
AP reporters discovered a huge construction waste dump in the village of Achstyr near Sochi last week.
So a landfill full of building materials, tires, cans, and insulation foam was found in August and immediately reported to environmentalists.
Russian authorities have been notified and the garbage is gone.
Just for a little while.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a dump the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, several have been built in the area, reports The Times.
The site is operated by Russian Railways, a state-owned monopoly that is building about 60 kilometers of track between Sochi airport and the sports center.
The enterprise, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways denied that the dump was set up by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are desperate.
According to the residents of Achstyr, trucks full of waste have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
Experts say that the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymta River, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here will contaminate Sochi's water sources for the next ten to 15 years", Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem for the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics will cost $43 billion.
Last year's London Games cost only 19 billion and the Vancouver Games nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns about snow cover, there have been reports of human rights violations at the sports and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers stitched his mouth shut to protest not being paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are handling a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple has matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy for both generations.
Tai and Associates, a Japanese studio, was commissioned to design a house on a plot of land that is located at the corner of two streets, with the property itself sloping somewhat.
The request also stated that the house would be shared by two generations who would like to live together, but each would have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed a small office as well.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping plot.
So the architects decided to place each household on one floor of the house.
"We have respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the site in designing the site".
"The three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others but has their privacy", explain the designers.
The parents' home is a garden level with an old pine tree, which is a place of family tradition and memory.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as they differ in the different finishes of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed by using planks, the part where the office is is plastered white and the remaining elements remain in pure concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, making the interior of the house very much connected to the exterior.
The parents' home, or kitchen, dining room, and living room, is surrounded by a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interior and exterior connections are highlighted by a side wall that starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house through the main hallway and then climb the stairs to their rooms.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what architects did to make the house stand out and give it something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.

The second floor is composed of one large open space that extends freely onto a terrace with a beautiful view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the front door, find themselves in the lobby, and then climb the stairs up.
Defend academic freedom, as it is for Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly in recent months written open letters to students, teachers and school administrators in several countries to defend academic freedom against the election campaign being waged by President Zeman in schools.
I've had successes, more or less.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary chairman of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of not being invited to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school officials who were no longer so brave and made it possible for Miloš Zeman to visit: the University of Technical Education in Brno, the Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, the University of Business in Ostrava, the Commercial Academy in Cologne, the University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we are seeing the continuation of the policy push in the universities.
The newly elected ODS MP, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, he seems to be normal.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying on as mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the heights of the CPSU, who are both members of parliament and heights, and like them, degrade both professions?
Because you're telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions of the left hind leg.
I know, we have an example here of Michael Hašek, who can even handle dozens of functions at once.
I don't think that's an example of a person you should follow.
We find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Franková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post to be able to fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason I recommend you leave the position of dean is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current position in both positions as an advantage for the University.
But you can help your "school" without becoming dean.
I think that the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig, will be shared by your students.
So consider your resignation and save face.
Otherwise, you could get the voters to count on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be for long.
In Kunovice, the cabbage bubbles, they don't add chemicals to it
Over a thousand tons of sour cabbage are to be produced in the coming months in the Slovak Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here started in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925, the health food has been made here in the traditional way, by stepping directly into the big tanks.
In the modern industrial age, it's a rarity.
Our workers walk almost ten kilometers in a shift.
Each of the ten tanks holds 15 to 30 tonnes of cabbage, and it takes three shifts to fill one", said David Kladroba, director of the Slovakian Fruit Plant.
Cabbage is transported directly from the fields to the company's premises by farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclavsk.
The fruit workers then clean the vegetables, remove the brushes, and throw them into the scrubber.
From there, the cut cabbage falls into 20-foot-deep pools, where white-clad cobblers work tirelessly with sticks.
They're pushing out unwanted air.
The last crushed layer of cabbage is covered with a cloth and loaded with water.
"The green crumb then matures for six to eight weeks in spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation promoters", stressed the director of the Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to home production, with individual layers of workers sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After the cabbage is fermented, it travels to the filling line.
Pack in a sweet-sour broth in bags or glasses and sterilise.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also being shown in a number of other countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, has announced that he is willing to travel to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
Hans-Christian Sträbele, a German lawmaker, met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he had been granted asylum, on Thursday, discussing the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, which the MEP handed over to the media on Friday in Berlin, said: Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as deserters and seeks to criminalise political speech with heavy prosecutions that leave no room for defence.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible".
Tensions between the United States and Germany began to rise when it emerged that the NSA had been listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there was any chance of hearing Mr Snowden as a witness without putting himself in danger and completely ruining relations with the US, it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former contract lawyer for the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia once he left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need reassurance that he would be safe there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the worldwide reaction to his political speech gave him courage.
Citizens everywhere and high officials  including those in the United States  have applauded the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance in the public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.
We're sorry to be killed, but we're innocent, Khmer Rouge officials say
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
During the Khmer Rouge's rule, which was based on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians - at least a quarter of the population - died from exhaustion, starvation, disease, torture, and execution between 1975 and 1979.
The commander of the notorious S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea of the true scale of the killing.
"It's easy to say I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation", Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority", he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to "treat people badly or kill them, to deny them food or to commit genocide".
But he did acknowledge a "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people", he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives during the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology".
"He lied to us".
"He just wants to be absolved".
"He doesn't care about others", she declared.
"If he had not given orders, his subordinates would not have killed", she added, saying that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters".
The court was also to hear the case of the Khmer Rouge regime's 'Foreign Minister' Ieng Sary, who died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent to stand trial by the court in September 2012 for dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage .
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in its announcement on Wednesday, it said passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper luggage compartment, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if paying passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is meant to encourage travelers to make payments in advance.
"We don't like to charge this fee", she said.
The airlines started charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges by packing as much of their luggage into the storage area as possible, often leaving no room.
Charging is one way to teach passengers to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee isn't really to raise more money.
The point is, Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding space in the top storage area is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier gate can bring in baggage for free, while another passenger in line will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be modified to ensure passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage charge will not be in place until the summer, but no date has yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money and that passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, did not touch the hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit later.
The only airline that also charges such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, says airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage fee would bring in USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and was surprised by what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit's unusual charge for hand luggage.
"Boarding a plane was the most fluid thing I've ever seen in my airline career", he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, and boarding was in no time.
Frontier will also be charging for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit's example.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled free of charge.
The water will continue to be free.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce a beverage charge in 2008, but after passenger complaints, it withdrew seven months later and no other major airline has done so.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand luggage unless passengers buy flights directly from the airline is its latest attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to direct passengers to buy directly from them instead of through online travel agents.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage reward to 25% of the mileage.
So a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier bought through an online travel agent is a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and it's losing money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by its business partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9% and capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter.
Republic is trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
The NSA doesn't blame hackers for the website crash, but "internal error"
The top-secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website went down for a few hours last week due to an internal glitch, not a hacker attack as some online sources have claimed.
"The NSA.gov website was down for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update", the spy agency said in an e-mailed statement.
The problem will be solved by the end of the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors recorded that the NSA website was down for at least six hours, and the site remains inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were "not compromised at all".
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of online hacker activists claimed to be responsible for taking down NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers overload and the site crashes.
These cyber tactics are relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has become the focus of public attention and stinging criticism in recent months after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs were exposed -- all the product of the NSA's secret files being stolen from the agency and leaked by a disillusioned former employee, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today's crash was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit declined due to a decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by lower third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries and contract problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not published any flight test dates for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it provided updated information as to whether this aircraft will comply with its ambitious plan to commence commercial operations from next September.
After its maiden test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft has only flown three times, raising questions about the success of the testing phase.
The results were not as predicted and the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8%.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from "higher yield" to "sector performance" on Thursday, expecting the stock market to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we had generally expected smaller aircraft deliveries, we were very disappointed by the profit margin in the transport sector", Doerksen said in a client message.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market scepticism to grow towards this programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries will break into the lower end of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and, after a delay of several months, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft is modest at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to verify the company's claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
The Commission has already established that the aid was necessary to cover the costs of the airport.
The Commission has also examined the impact of the aid on the air transport sector.
Executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the upgrade, and that's what we did.
That's going to happen throughout the flight program.
Bombardier says the second of five test planes is scheduled to take off in the coming weeks, with the others shortly after.
Analysts are, however, skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to have evaluated its plan for the aircraft's entry into service and will provide updates in the coming months.
This slow pace of flight testing  although in line with Bombardier's internal plan  is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015, Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ended 30 September.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover decreased marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4,56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders have dropped from 83 planes to 26.
The outstanding orders in the aviation division amounted to EUR 32,9 billion on 30 September, which was unchanged on 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our expectations, but we were disappointed by low order intake and the overall market situation", said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest manufacturer of trains, reported that revenue in this division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Outstanding transport orders amounted to EUR 32.6 billion at 30 September, a marginal increase on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The executives said that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in Thursday afternoon trading.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine addict lawyer who warned mobster about police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to be passing information to the King of the Underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed a drug mafia member of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass sensitive information to the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough about his drug smuggling investigation after he became a suspect in the cocaine ring.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash (party) and hailed by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police stalked Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics trials.
Police spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having dinner with his law firm colleagues.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular Class A drug user.
Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he secretly sought information on the arrests of two men for the benefit of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were being followed at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of raids by police seized heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million, along with GBP 200,000 in cash, 32 other people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta, 42, passed information to criminals for fear of being caught with his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, experienced a humiliating moment in Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice.
During an earlier hearing, he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police investigation revealed that Scarborough had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him planting 60% pure drugs under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough was subsequently in regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium at Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned to the house where he found the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two people.
The court heard that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular cocaine user".
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell within "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get several credit cards out of it, but they were all intercepted and his hair samples were taken.
When questioned by police, he said that he ran an office at both his home and workplace, and that clients visited him at home on business.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted key players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "Who knows better than a criminal lawyer that he must not break the law?"
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were no doubt legitimate, because he was his lawyer.
But it went way beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He was doing everything he could to thwart the police investigation to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has not brought his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he has dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied wrongdoing, stating: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately".
However, after the hearing, Police Inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: Mr Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to becoming a criminal himself when he started getting drugs from organised crime.
His cocaine addiction left him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of top organized crime leaders who tasked him with gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must be trusted and reliable in the public eye.
Mr Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
Mr. Ditt was investigated by Lancashire's Serious and Organized Crime Unit, and convicted of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 traffickers were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta gave an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to represent death row clients in America, as a dinner guest he would like to have Muhammad Ali, and cited inequality as a motivation for the job.
He negotiated government with Klaus and Spade.
Now the People's People have sent Jan Kasal against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen seats in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter into negotiations for a government with at least one advantage.
The team, which has already begun to discuss the outline of a possible coalition, includes Jan Kasal, a man who was a popular figure in the negotiations for the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš have no such matador on their side.
I think this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal", Kasal predicts as this year's interviews unfold.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"It is a scary news story and it is appropriate to ask what prevents Parliament from simply dismantling the independence of the judiciary tomorrow", the newspaper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal would always be biased because it is an extension of the government's arm and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the House", he said.
According to the Star, the bill effectively gives the government total control over the media, and the Standard newspaper says that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been hit hard, and criticizes the bill as "tough".
The passage of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at bolstering national security in the wake of the September Islamic shooter attack at the Westgate shopping mall.
The Kenyan media turned on itself when they broadcast a security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media worker for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, with the risk of being "de-listed" or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to shut down most radio stations.
It is also said that these measures may have a devastating impact on what is called Kenya's "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that if they shut down the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what can happen", wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel cuts imposed by the National Wage Agency and restore their fat wages of around 532,000 shillings a month, which is among the highest in the world.
They must save, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what interest rates
More and more Czechs are putting their money away.
Still, they're not up there with the regional savings champions.
The Austrians save the most money, saving an average of $181 a month.
Slovakians save a little more than Czechs.
This is according to a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The survey also found that the mood of savers is improving, and two thirds of those surveyed plan to save more money.
While the Czechs are about halfway up the list of savers, people in Romania and Serbia still use very little of the products.
For example, a survey found that nearly one in two Serbs saves "under the pillow" at home.
In the country this year, the number of people who save more money per month has increased.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents saved between $1,000 and $2,000 each month on various types of savings, this year it is up by five percent.
The average monthly savings, on the other hand, have fallen slightly to CZK 2,078.
The most popular savings product is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, whereas three years ago it was the preferred way of valuing savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is decreasing, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents now use them, compared with nearly a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider saving important, most do not know what the returns on individual products are.
Young people in particular don't know how their money is being used by the time they're 30.
In contrast, the oldest group of people are the most aware of the returns on their savings, with 73 percent of those over 50 doing so.
In international comparison, the Erste Group is the Czech leader in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
Slovaks and Austrians follow with a margin of 12 percent.
The UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is beginning work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were established 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of a document to be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now was the time to put national interests above.
I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns about Mozambique's security are escalating as powerful personalities clash
Under a statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded in her business attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined a crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, supported first by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize that country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that an open conflict is unlikely to re-emerge in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
At stake is a fast-growing economy, for the discovery of vast offshore oil and coal deposits in the northwest may yield more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and the United States' Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo claims that the government has triggered the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 September.
The violent attack by the former rebels then culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo party spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflict because it allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever power he had left to try to prove he could dictate his own decisions to the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns were raised when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our aim is to return to negotiations, but seriously", Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these sides have done little to ease tensions between the two sides, fueled by a series of clashes this year.
It is a battle between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral changes, has already said it will boycott the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as a dying movement's attempt to gain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while the newest party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who is out of office for a second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multiparty democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to lose the presidency", Mazanga said.
It's unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south road.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo but where the city of Beira is located, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga declined to comment on whether Renamo would repeat its threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good, Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development, and the recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems", he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to roads", he says.
Children should be taught myths and legends as 'models for the way of life', says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that brute strength cannot equal cunning cunning, while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths would be 'too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in schools', said Crossley-Holland, who advocates careful selection of works for their age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk art are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers are "turning off" the "binding story with the "underlying" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also wrote The Penguin Book and The British National Tales, says: "You can have good intentions, but you do better to keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is that you need some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or have a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of right and wrong.
And it has to be subconscious; revealed through the story, not outright defined.
The old truth about showing is better than describing.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digital
At first glance, it's obvious that the Great Planetarium's auditorium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can crawl into new comfortable seats, and a 17-meter diameter dome-shaped projection screen from the American company Spitz is nailed over their heads.
In the middle of the room is the most important part of it, the new projector from Japan.
To perfect the picture, smaller projectors are placed throughout the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the auditorium.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image", said the director of the Brno Observatory, Jiří Dušek.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap but gives a unified impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of conventional personal computers", noted astronomer Tomáš Hladík.
The digital camera can create an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the ocean floor.
It puts the viewer right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
The closest similar facility is in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the theater plans to show purchased programs and their own work in the hall.
There are two shows on the schedule starting Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut, and it's for adults.
It teaches people about astronaut training, takes them into space, turns them on a centrifuge, and then gives them a glimpse of the harsh conditions astronauts face in space.
The second program is for children and it's called Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano erupted.
The whole digital library cost about 50 million crowns, paid for mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost 10 million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers", explained Dušek.
The digital installation follows the reconstruction of the entire building that the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've studied 11,000 ads!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis found over 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were in the daily press and 6,800 (62 percent) online.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for posting job vacancies.
Back in 2005, when the survey was first conducted, it was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has been around 60%.
The analysis shows that job advertisements largely reflect the current labour market situation.
A simple example is the comparison of the number of advertisements published during a period of economic prosperity and a period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 advertisements were published during the same period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The online job offer is geared towards a narrower, more qualified group of occupations.
In contrast, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of occupations, including the working class, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The representation of the selected occupational groups varies for both media.
Advertisements for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers, and financial experts have become the top of the Internet.
The position of programmer or small business owner was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professions is much lower, while the service and labour professions are particularly high.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through their job offers.
Other areas of focus included foreign language skills, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was listed in three percent of advertisements, and on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only 2% of the advertisements required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Requests for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (11 percent in the daily press, 57 percent on the Internet).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads.
The requirements for practice are mostly linked to the qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
The occupations of workers are mainly mechanics and repairmen or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, added study author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also list qualification and skill requirements for potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
Communication skills have long been the most frequently requested skill in advertising.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York comedy festival: the New Yorker
New York City is arguably the birthplace of American stand-up comedy: Almost a century ago, the variety performer Frank Fray, who worked as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled crowd by means of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year  with over sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become so successful that they're too big to play in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows on smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has taken off with his sitcom and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but she is best known for her fast-paced series of videos Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the sullen, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be the interview:
Steinberg started out as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a sit-down comedy show on TV Land called Sit down comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is being held at the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in the comedic DNA of all Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and he's like, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
Oil prices fell further to $ 96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high reserves were offset by a report showing a strengthening of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil index for December supply fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange late this morning.
Thursday's drop was 39 cents, and for the month of October, it's down 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves in recent weeks have weighed on the price.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. inventories have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stockpile has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports on Chinese manufacturing gave a boost to higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which recovered to 7.8% in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the London International Exchange.
No, not at all, Mr. Hush.
We have a unique opportunity to tell the politicians that this is not the way.
We need to put pressure on Martin Hašek to be stripped of all political office and leave the parliamentary seat.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so flimsy.
Martin Hašek protects himself by a promise he made, but everyone and especially politicians must be aware of the consequences of a given promise and give careful consideration to what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babiš has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A self-serving agenda promoted by a liar is unreliable.
In politics, you don't apologize, in politics you step down.
Mr. Hashak, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm this, unless you've just been lying - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you'll leave politics alone, like a man.
Then people will accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and bears responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, flawed person or a lifelong skater.
You may think it's unfair to only address you, but you are the leader and they are just lost sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, put down the shame and then attack again, but that's the behavior of partisans or traitors.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so act like it.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the order regarding the arrest and search procedure by the NYPD.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the stop and search program at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge's case.
The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision will be stayed pending an appeal by the city.
A judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its stop-and-question program.
The city challenged its findings and its corrective orders, including a decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its procedures and its training program related to them.
The appeals court heard arguments for the requested stay on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge must be removed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges by not acting as a judge required to avoid the appearance of enterprise, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement in which she openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop-and-search program.
It established an independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and oversight, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some of the most frequently stopped areas.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after police searches.
The city's oral argument is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
There have been some form of stop and search for decades, but the number of searches under independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, mostly black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a class action case.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD's stop and search program claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and efficiency of the police force, and may influence how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale but not crime and waste money, but they will not solve a broader problem that has put the police force under pressure after its numbers have fallen by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but she reformed the way the NYPD introduced searches.
One fifth of shopping malls are experiencing low attendance
This is according to data from real estate consultancies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre is opening to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
The poor performance of the medium and large centres is about 20%.
The main problems are inadequately large centre to site and poor layout, i.e. too many floors or complicated and unclear passage layout, or dead centre places", said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Sylvie Samadi, head of retail real estate at Jones Lang LaSalle, about one fifth of malls are experiencing low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport access, low income of local population or overcrowding of the local market.
Some projects opened almost to full capacity, but their results were mostly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, consumers are a bit conservative and reluctant to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centres must do more to 'lure' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events", added Samadi.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable and even rising in some centres, as landlords were willing to reduce rents and lease some units during the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)", added Soták.
According to Sylvie Samadi, the malls that have opened in the last two years are moving very slowly in the market.
But there is a market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a building site for a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convenience centres', focused on shopping and daily services for the population living in the immediate vicinity", said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also room for additional shopping centres in the domestic market.
This applies to small service centres, large projects in Prague, medium-sized projects or expansions in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth", Soták added.
In Prague, he sees space for a planned shopping center on the Victory Square, and he believes that the streets of Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square have a clear potential.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, which allows retailers to cover and expand into ever smaller cities at favourable rental and operating costs, and there is still space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior's shopping houses, which benefit from a good location", added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
The Czech Republic currently has 90 modern shopping centres with a total gross leasable area of more than 2.2 million square metres.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres by number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK.
The Czech Republic is below the EU average in terms of the number of shopping centres, and lagged behind the UK and France by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to verify the tip.
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of "hacking into the phone, surveillance and confrontation" to confirm a fraudulent tip about a love affair allegedly involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that the News of the World newspaper had picked up a false report in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and invade her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who stands outside his house hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to put stories in people's heads to see what they say", said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three methods to investigate stories: hacking into phones, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "But sure he does".
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's reporting department when a source who had a sexual interest in Mrs. Pawlby was told: "You're just wasting your time, she's with Charles".
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were labeled "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were overseeing the surveillance of Mrs. Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message saying, "I've received a story we're going to publish tomorrow that Charles and I would love to talk about".
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was modeled after other high-profile figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
It was reported in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with other individuals to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking into the phone.
NSA disclosures increase public paranoia about state surveillance
One quiet day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the American consulate in Frankfurt, the economic capital of Germany.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to photograph the roof of the American forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of the bugs, and the action sparked an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, insisted in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal trade secrets from foreign companies to benefit American companies, thereby enhancing their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.
But ever since Edward Snowden, a former collaborator turned whistleblower, began to reveal his valuable collection of U.S. surveillance, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil companies and gaining access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, widespread paranoia about government surveillance reached new dimensions.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been tapped for 10 years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely the leading businessmen are also potential targets.
Snowden exposed the intense cooperation between US intelligence agencies and corporations.
I'd say it's possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up", said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy EY, German companies believe that the US now poses as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
But in all the documentation Mr. Snowden has uncovered, there is no evidence so far that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks some IT and internet capability and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading businessmen are skeptical.
There are voices in the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
That is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scale and sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China.
There is a major shift in cloud computing, where European officials have become more aware that data stored in the US falls under US jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of the chief executives of SAP, says, "We have this new question for customers that wasn't here a year ago - where is my data stored, and can you guarantee that it will stay in that jurisdiction physically?"
Many senior German officials argue that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at all costs.
It's no surprise that economic espionage is being carried out.
It's always been done.
It has been a key issue for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion, says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
In general, business leaders are reluctant to boast about the countermeasures they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking a free USB drive to a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of Audi, says that for many years it has been the common practice to collect cell phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BfV advises managers to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of embezzlement.
The prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that SMEs will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific fields.
SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BfV in its report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimate documents in February listed France as the second-largest perpetrator of hacking for economic correspondents, behind Russia and Israel, behind China.
A board member at a German risk-free company concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, while cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies".
The parents of a teenage boy in Georgia who died in a freak accident believe he was murdered.
The parents of a Georgia teenage boy whose body was found inside a wrestling glove in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia was found decapitated in a straightened mental state behind the bleachers at the gymnasium of his high school on January 11.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office has concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the 17-year-old's family denies it.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son was murdered", said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They believe it goes against logic, laws of physics and common sense", Crump said.
They feel that this is to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag", he said.
Attorney General Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna follow the facts, no matter where they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "atmospheric asphyxiation".
But the second autopsy, Moore said, gave a different cause of death.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore added that if he discovers enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to warrant a criminal investigation or civil rights violation, he will request the FBI to execute it.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A judge in south Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents hope the video footage will provide clues to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools regarding allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies in school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have available adrenaline  most commonly used is the EpiPen automatic injector  to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also lists typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say: "I feel like someone is sticking it in my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue itches".
Parents of intersex children can choose non-gendered
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for babies born with ambiguous gender identity.
Newborn babies will no longer be assigned only to either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to specify any gender for such children, and allows them to specify their gender on their birth certificates as "unclear" or "unspecified".
The purpose of the law is to stop pressuring parents to rush their child into sex reassignment surgery and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: "I'm neither male nor female".
I'll be a doctor-made witch, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed genitals.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available and determine it rather than waiting and monitoring the child's psychological and physical development until the time of the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender determination problems, said the new German law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children are not", he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowledge of how a child develops gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to sex but to their biological make-up, which is neither exclusively male nor female but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits may be expressed in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify themselves as male, female or third gender in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, 52, an Australian, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her "gender-indefinite" status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third mark, an X, in addition to M (male) and F (female), for intersex persons.
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theories" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also took a stand against the German law, writing: As the world is being pulled into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are upending two more pillars of civilization.
A mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to see her babies assigned a sex at birth.
Parenting itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child, she said for a parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children of both sexes were called hermaphroditic, after the handsome Greek who was bisexual.
And about a decade ago, the medical community believed that gender was like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery, saying that gender is a complex issue and that doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how their sex will affect the children when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency", Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The prevailing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender is amenable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social causes and environmental influences, such as how parents raised their children, affected the child's genes and hormones, shaping the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theory became controversial.
He recommended that the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a circumcision be castrated, had his testicles removed, and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different", said Drescher.
When the boy was 15, he had surgery to make himself a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors still use that model today.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations began to express dissatisfaction with the results.
Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, was born with male chromosomes but a vague sex drive.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfactory" life.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones at 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent for a vaginal replacement at 18.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DSD), which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop his genitals properly.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took a lot of testosterone and had his breasts removed,
The surgeries caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, and she works to normalize the perception of intersex people.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for informed choice, is concerned that the German law "incites stigma and stigma".
Many activists fear that the German law will do enough to encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose the "wrong" for their child, she said.
We're afraid it's going to lead to intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will ultimately sound like, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be assigned a third gender.
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender, she said.
German law is about to assign him at birth.
This is a battle a little child shouldn't be fighting right now.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that German law gives authority to both parents and children.
Baratz' daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
'The law gives parents some room to make their decision without rushing,' said Baratz.
It gives them time to take some tests and think about it and it gives them time to type "husband or wife".
In that respect, everything is fine. You're raising your child and you love him.
You have a wonderful child and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
'It gives the child the opportunity to be involved in decision-making and it takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,' she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender they identify with more, and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
A drunk man poured gasoline all over the house, threatening to burn himself and his family to death!
The tension was rising, the fear was escalating.
The man started threatening to burn the whole house down.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade from Mladá Boleslav and a volunteer fire brigade, were called to the scene.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to reason with the man about his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn the house down.
So the task force had to break into the house, and they took out the man and tied him up.
The attacker then ended up in the Juvobol's Hospital for examination, from where he was transferred to the alcohol detention station.
The firefighters eventually poured sorbent on the house, which was then cleaned.
In addition to the people, all the domestic animals were rescued from the house.
The man didn't give in to the police negotiator, so a team went after him.
Report: the obama campaign was considering replacing biden with hillary clinton.
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's top adviser was secretly considering replacing 2012 Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday night that the president's top aides had held intensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes for re-election.
According to National Political Correspondent for The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough account of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the election impact of moving former Secretary of State Clinton to the vice presidency.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew the change was being considered.
The book Double Down claims that Daley was the front man for the bid to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidacy would not significantly increase Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been doing a lot of digging and this was one of them", he told the Daley Post.
You must remember that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we were like, "Chris, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "necessary care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to see if the move would pay off in the election.
"You don't spend that kind of money on elections and qualitative research in campaigns if something isn't really serious", Martin told AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential shuffling of the cards.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former chief of staff admitted that it's possible Obama knew about them.
Martin added that Double Down definitely doesn't answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research that was being done to eliminate Biden.
"Maybe", said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has created the first ice cream that glows in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine creature and developed a glowing eyeball.
He got the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes glowing.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer  raises the pH level of the protein and then causes its irradiation.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more you lick it, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick me I'm delicious, says: It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we're still in the early stages, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of this substance.
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween because it creates this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because glowing jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each hill costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next product is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream".
It's essentially impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm hoping we can find a way to do that.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, which was artificially created by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late, and show off to the neighbors in costume.
I feel like I've become a little bit of a prick today.
I haven't had a candy bar in my apartment in two years, and this year probably won't be any different.
But statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I'm the black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans - in fact, 158 million of them - will celebrate Halloween, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations.
But what I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
According to NRF, $6.9 billion of the $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year, the latest fashion trend is sexy inanimate objects.
It's not just women who are sexy anymore; it can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for the men, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies in the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will be making it to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
As for the candy, we're not wasting time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey bars, lollipops, candy milk duds and Twizzlers and Clark's bar.
That's great news for the 41 million holidaymakers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to storm our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Candy Stores, almost 16,000 tons of it is sold around Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn flakes.
It's a secret I never solved.
Nothing more Halloween-like than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like Terror behind the walls, Howl-O-Scream and The House of Shock.
In fact, there are officially 1,200 haunted houses in the United States that have a $500 million profit, according to the American Haunted Houses Association, and that includes those amazing pictures of you peeing in fear that your friend posts on Facebook, and you can't delete them, and the person who likes it sees the photo and posts a comment like "Hello, you're cute".
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were kids, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree.
Fortunately for us, the pumpkin baby trend started with Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin that weighs almost a ton.
Land Rover racing series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercom equipment.
The choice is advanced brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between plants.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The racers who come to Bowler have changed".
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also a reachable path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the harshness and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We've really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge car. It's going to be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
We have an early election in two years.
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last one, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way out and every government will come out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long", said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the life of the new election cycle at two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly make a completely different choice next time: "I think it will be a bit more balanced".
At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman does not accept that his party could lose voters in the next election like this year (it lost about 300 thousand votes compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be an early election, it would strengthen Andrei Babis's YES 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Grandma will lose.
Schwarzenberg comments on the turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting last year with part of the party leadership, declared that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in charge of social democracy:
"Democratic Party officials like little boys go to the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party".
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and smarter".
"Because I've never seen anything so impatiently badly done in my life", added the TOP 09 chairman.
And he said to President Zeman (whom he had met in the presidential race): "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to take over the party".
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise for you personally about the election?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Far Treaty Register, which was discussed by the House committees before the election but fell under the table with the early elections.
The chairman of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktuálně.cz claims that such speed is due to "these laws being needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to outpace similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the election campaign of "stealing" the program of the ANO movement with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off a motion that had already entered the second reading of the House.
Firefighters arrive to rescue a lost puppy trapped 50 feet [15 m] above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Ruby the cocker spaniel ran away after a little car accident.
Three days later, he was seen trapped in a quarry by a man walking his dog.
Firefighters were scrambling up the rock face to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who came to rescue it after it somehow got trapped on a dangerous ledge in a quarry 50 feet above the ground.
Nine-month-old Ruby the Cocker Spaniel escaped a minor car accident on Sunday afternoon, surviving for three days on his own until being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after a small accident, they frantically searched for their missing dog and posted challenges on social media.
On Wednesday, about 2:15 p.m., a sharp-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby trapped on a ledge in a quarry 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and slid down to free Ruby, using an animal bag to pick him up off the cliff.
Technical rescue team leader Andy Clayton said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock face, 50 feet from top to bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrow when he came to the rescue. He was frozen to death.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual outing.
It's incredible that someone saw a dog.
Technical rescue team leader Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to escape".
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an exam, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was frightened when I saw the rescue operation".
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him again.
The vet said if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The firemen did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them. They've all been so wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there".
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims he definitely didn't leave after Katy Perry was 18.
During an interview with Australian radio this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals on Jagger's 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he came on to her.
And she added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me".
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's representative, 70, said he categorically denies ever proposing to Katy Perry.
The agent said, "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else".
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert string this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time, there is a warning that an independent Scotland's EU membership would be conditional on it joining Schengen.
This has given rise to stories of passport controls at Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspapers mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but  as you might expect  it didn't make the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws where it suits them.
Since Scotland is now out of Schengen, an offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for whatever it really wants from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that it became a dig, a journalistic duck, that "independence means passport control", I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting point in this bearded storyteller.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade the London chamout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is the true story of Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally failed.
The euro crisis has officially put the so-called Europe project to rest.
Throughout Europe, parties dedicated to resisting the EU or abolishing the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party  founded this year  came out of nowhere and already won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, effectively "sweeping" the Free Democrats (the British equivalent of the Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
At home, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, has become a defining moment.
The austerity imposed by Germany and the European Central Bank, coupled with the tightness of national economies through a single currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing high budget deficits  this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that locks its members into exchange rates favourable to German exporters  and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, Southern Europe is at a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only solution is to cut public revenue and expenditure  as Germany encourages.
Behind the current budgetary and currency problems lies a deeper cause of Europe's poor performance.
As a result of the Green energy policy supported by Brussels  the code of conduct for supporting French and German firms at consumer expense , European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world wouldn't stop the European petrochemical industry from being trampled on by cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering revolt, especially in France, once a zealous supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to rise to the level of Washington in the world.
Berlin, however, no longer needed Paris as a proof of political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policies in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote  a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically be positive on the left.
How is Le Pen handling her newfound popularity among white working class?
It would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament that is working against the single currency.
If the anti-European parties do well in this election, which they are likely to do, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
I think that in the foreseeable future, growing anti-European sentiment and anti-monetary attitudes will merge and the euro will die.
The EU will not disappear, but rather become something freer in the sense of the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the US.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a part of (basically) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including the ability to tell Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a loose arrangement of Europe, provided it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should follow Norway's example and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  surprisingly  the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to accept austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early adulthood
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
There's no evidence of hormones or other chemicals
Experts say that one of the triggers for early puberty may be the obesity epidemic.
The trend toward earlier puberty is not as apparent in boys.
Former CNN anchor Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be terrified when her daughter starts to grow breasts and pubic hair at age seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are fairly common among American girls and are the new standard.
"I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid progress toward full puberty", said Kaplowitz.
Visible developmental signs, such as breast growth, pubic and forearm hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, in the past 40 years, there has been little change in the age of first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, down from 12.75 years in 1970.
"Once the breasts start to develop, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstrual period", says Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
The most reliable test of how puberty will progress is time.
There is debate about what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8, the girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process slows or stops  which can be closely monitored by paediatricians.
Rapid growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to run tests to rule out serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunting and shrinkage in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormone therapy depend on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
As for the use of medication, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he acknowledges that "repressing puberty can alleviate a girl's behavioral problems and her feelings of being different from her peers".
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried she might get pregnant or how she'll handle her hygiene", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and angry because she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
But there is still no coherent evidence to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz suggests that the most serious cause is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to puberty timing.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Globally, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another conundrum: Although boys develop facial hair and pubic hair at an early age, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) conference added to the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty", said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeo Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you expect", advises Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, it is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinkova as the bartender.
Has he got a new job?
Actress Nadja Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the scenes in the role of a barmaid and she was very good at it.
That a popular Czech actress might be planning to change careers and start a bar business?
Nadia Konvalinkova showed up at the James Joyce Irish pub and was pouring beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
My boss even offered to hire me so I could make a living brewing beer.
But I refused, preferring to stay with what I am doing today, acting", said Konvalink, who was a guest at the Irish pub's 20th anniversary.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey now and then", the actress revealed her taste.
Nadia's longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also attended the event.
I'm dead, and I can't drink in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to stick to that", the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers are fighting over seat width, big contracts at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights between leading aircraft manufacturers sparked a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute concerns the width of the seats provided for long-haul economy class flights  not exactly the width that airlines would normally avoid, but whose space allocation is key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards to offer at least 18 inches wide economy seats, but major U.S. rival Boeing says it's up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is arranged  especially whether it has 9 or 10 seats side by side  is the basis of the economic performance requirements for the designs of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats more than 17 inches wide, spread out over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 model carries 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread over nine.
Giant airplanes often compete with each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.
He recently gave a preview of what could be the start of a new advertising war by showing a photograph of three people crammed into a restaurant to financiers with the caption "Would you like this?"
"Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats narrower than those on regional turboprops", said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As diets change, people get bigger, but the seats on planes haven't changed radically.
Since the early 1970's, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 had increased in weight by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average American in the 21st century has a waistline of 100 centimeters.
Airbus claims that its rival is sticking to a 1950s seat concept, when the average width of a newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research that suggests that extending the seat by an inch [2.5 cm] improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seat sizes, saying it is not in the airplane manufacturers' power to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just seat width.
It's really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful, said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what's profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, more elbow room is essential, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute is a race for aircraft orders with estimated sales of at least $700 billion in catalogue prices over the next few decades, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the seating arrangement is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that their latest twin-engine long-haul designs are 20 per cent more efficient than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance requirements depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 10 seat 777X with the 9 seat 777 concept.
The unit cost profit is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to fill more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products", said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat cabins in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"A seat that is 45 centimeters wide would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but they offer the airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Travelers even carry a measuring tape to check competing arrangements.
While boasting of comfort, all manufacturers also offer high density aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travellers.
Airbus is offering an A350 with 10 rows of seats, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin adjustments by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other large modern aircraft manufacturer, the call for new industry standards will go unheeded, but may deter a surge in 777X sales.
HIV infection in Prague has exceeded 1,000
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, 50 people were tested for the infection, five years later, 121 were tested, and in 2010, 180 were tested.
Last year, 212 were infected, a record number.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year", said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years headed the Prague House of Light for Patients.
He said that from January to September last year, 165 HIV patients were added to the country, compared with 176 this year.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the highest number of infections in Prague.
Their number reached 1,005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian Region and 116 from Ústecký Region.
The lowest number of cases is from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of the patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected by blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not occurred in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, passed on from their mothers.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is there, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
The fantastic film from the universe Gravitation sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
In October, the film was seen by almost 150,000 people and grossed over 26 million kroner, according to the Union of Film Distributors.
Most of the reviews are positive.
Others, however, find some irregularities in it.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from among astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and if they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Star and Planetarium Brno): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dream-like stories.
The movie Gravity is no exception, even though it pretends to be a "physically real" performance.
He's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it so much.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow doesn't float in weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station travel in very different orbits, so they cannot be seen in the same shot.
Some viewers blame the unrealistic effect and even the whole behavior of fire in the weightless state.
They said the suits wouldn't hold up to that kind of blow.
The characters in Gravity often collide with objects, and the suits can easily withstand anything.
The critics were not spared, nor the plot.
Some critics say such a massive tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic.
Besides, he wonders why the Doctor was sent into space to fix the equipment.
People are arguing on the forums about the "unrealistic" behavior of ropes.
She says it looks like it was made for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I've only seen it on the big screen, but I can say without a doubt that I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) not to stick to reality.
"More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by the three times the space station is shown with a degrading level of technology (the last one is Chinese)".
"China won't be until the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than it does in the movie".
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, and so the naturally oriented viewer will appreciate that the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved in various cosmic collisions and collisions, speaking the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic including the thin atmosphere and the aurora flaring on the polar regions.
An in-depth investigation will certainly reveal irregularities.
Additionally, for example, I found in the comments that the preferred direction of various space debris in orbit appears in some scenes to be inverted from what it actually should be (west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Institute of Astronomy of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and heaven-calling transgressions against logic or natural laws in the film and compared to other films of similar focus it is seen that the creators took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
One of the things that doesn't make sense is the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in an orbit that's not as inclined as the ISS.
The result is a significant difference in speed and the rescue operation could not have actually taken place as depicted in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the separation of Kowalski and Stone, I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so it is not clear where the force acting on Kowalski is, which causes both actors to release at the moment when they no longer move towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect a mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, further tests will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is too strong to overcome all current approaches", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies hunt down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine poisoning.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice that were supplemented with nicotine continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated calmed down, the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient antibody levels, so they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into factories to make antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they even get a cigarette taste, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, smokers are much more likely to use it to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, the nicotine vaccine will not give them any pleasure, and that will help them quit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they cautioned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid.
A former Labor minister in New South Wales, Australia, is to be investigated by the state corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the policy of beach rentals at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew his lease on Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a cafe, without having to participate in a tender procedure after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the allegation that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's covert interests in these properties based on evidence presented Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of negotiations that began in 2005, the government pushed for the leases to be put out to tender.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term terms.
In 2009, the leases for businesses on Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need for a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally in favour of public tenders.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Trippodi admitted, was pushing for a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of the calls provided to ICAC showed calls between August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunne, a senior official who came to the Port Authority after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
Was the topic of discussion during these telephone calls the development of commercial rental policy? asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy of Mr Tripodi.
"No", said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but I can't remember this.
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes hit a target in Syria, official said
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Laziqiya on Thursday night, an administration official confirmed to Fox News.
This official did not specify what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in a way that could be agreed, while the chairman Štěch was stirring up a quarrel.
Captain Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
The Chairman of the Sabotka always was, and is, a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and clear and unusable, Vice President Zaorálek was most uncomfortable with the interview on television.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the CPSU to nominate the Vice-President of the Senate, Gajdůšková, the only one who would not have a disability and I think she would perform standard performance.
It's such a good solution, hardly anyone in management will support it.
I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what happened and move on without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could easily form a minority government with the blessing of Prime Minister Babiš and without the populists, but with the populist Minister of Health Hovorkou, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and one that President Okamura has pledged to support.
Chairman Babiš would eventually accept the tax advances because he's smart and he'll see that it can't be done without it.
The People wouldn't be trouble, because the Talker is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in government otherwise.
The same goes for the YES, there would be a valuable minister here too, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government involvement, but provide support, well, that's fine.
Let's give a little courage to Elena Gajdoshka!
Foreign workers with a visa may be subject to an eligibility test
With the government intending to expand police intervention, it is considering a test of eligibility for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if passed, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government feature article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it might offend Australia's neighbours.
The loud statements foreigners at the end of the line and work first for Australians are a very unpleasant relic of the time when unions demanded a protected labour market, she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, it has meant protecting the white workforce, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone in this region has picked up on the echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Secretary Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he's dealing with officials over human trafficking, has implemented five of the proposed changes, and the rest are still pending.
If the eligibility criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be subject to a detailed examination of the eligibility of their nomination for situations where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.
Following previous experience with enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, enterprises may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands this week.
A man's terrified nine-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him, and after his father died on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The HS2 work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start once the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Minister for Transport, Baroness Kramer, said the project would "connect Britain together".
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "excited" to be working with the UK government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase Two is complete, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from GBP 32,7 billion to GBP 42,6 billion.
The UK Government, which has been in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to investigate additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Our aim for HS2 is to really be a national network that better connects the UK and its cities.
We've greenlit SH2 because the benefits that it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also about connecting  across the UK, with HS2 improving connectivity to 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Scottish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to 'unambiguously support the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network'.
Mr Brown said: 'The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.
So we're excited to work with the UK government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to the benefit of everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers over the next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
She was arrested along with Bartha by the inspection and the anti-corruption police analyst
News of the arrest of Vit Barty began to spread on Thursday evening when the server Prvnízpravy.cz brought the report.
The MF DNES soon found out that the case had been taken over by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS), whose people were supposed to arrest Bart in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate deals with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its jurisdiction extends to civilians as well.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police, the head of analytics and computer science, Jan Petržílek, is among those arrested.
He used to work for the Security Intelligence Service.
However, the spokesman for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, declined to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her inspection spokeswoman Radka Sandorová did not want to say anything about the case, instead referring to the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of classified facts", said the spokeswoman of the representation Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also, from this vague reaction, it can be inferred that the event has occurred, but is in a state of secrecy that does not allow the speakers to say anything concrete.
Bart's lawyer, Oldrich Poudoba, is in a similar situation.
The media said that he represents Bart "in this case as well", but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police chief Peter Lessi.
He was promoted by Bart together with former Minister of Interior Radek John, who was in charge of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute that broke out between former Prime Minister Peter Nečas and VV even had to be resolved by then President Vaclav Klaus.
I don't know where this connection to me personally came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things", Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, it was Radek John, the real party leader, who put him in charge, but it was Bart.
Bart was now running for the election for the Dawn movement, narrowly losing the parliamentary seat by 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bart was one of many candidates from many parties on our candidacy and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura", distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who before the election said he gave Bart space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the issue of enforcers.
Vít Bárta was brought to court in 2012 with his former colleague from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite changes in the US to ease regulations on these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, as long as the devices remain in "flight mode".
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had reviewed this notification but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on board aircraft, he said.
This issue is covered by the rules requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was in favour of the change but announced that it would submit to the regulator's decision.
We would welcome CASA to do an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have it (wireless in-flight entertainment), it would improve the customer experience, said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that it will for the time being comply with the current regulations.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon", he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we're always interested in regulatory developments that may be beneficial to our passengers, and we're certainly going to thoroughly review the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not provided any information on the air carriers concerned.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, and also review manuals, training material, hand luggage programmes and passenger information.
Once an airline has confirmed its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude, the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The Panel also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seats or in a storage area above the head during take-off and landing.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, Singapore's mortgage industry is booming
Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earring at a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping mall to pay for her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman is transacting, became the third-highest-rated mortgage company on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Stopping jewellery is not only a quick way to borrow 1,300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga , but it is also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
The Singaporean landlords normally charge an annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, the advantages of the guarantee schemes are that they do not require any personal verification (payment history) or proof of income and can grant a loan faster than banks.
And so, with families feeling the pressure of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgages.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to mortgages to cope with their deteriorating financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's cited rising household credit usage, mainly due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of GDP.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weak consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from the middle to low [income brackets] will try to supplement their income wherever they can", said Song Seng Wun, economist at Malaysia's CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people gravely mortgaging their personal possessions and taking the opportunity to cash in their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items pawned at the city's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month".
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage industry is so great that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemeer and 15 similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia  where it has four branches  but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for their high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the mortgage not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
'Customers are mortgaging items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,' he says.
In society, asset pledges are increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secured financing.
Moreover, mortgage lenders are not limited to people in financial need.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches to deposit gold bars or Rolex watches, which can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our clients come from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for short-term reasons for their daring business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving cash flow problems", says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money fast.
A $325 million bailout for Tasmania's health care system
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's failing health care system include strict conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking urgent measures to avert the crisis caused by the island's ageing population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic disruptions.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with Andrew Wilkie, an independent Tasmanian MP.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the country", Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgeries at the request of a patient.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help to eliminate the debt.
The money is also for free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in response to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will help the Tasmanian health system in the best way", said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and record keeping obligations.
The State will have to maintain its current level of funding to receive the Australian Union money and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be useless unless there is real reform to lay the foundation for a more sustainable Tasmanian public health system.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in a meeting with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can lift the state's public health system out of a critical state", Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the Land, these additional elective procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
The Federal Opposition spokesman for health care, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is a sham.
"The reason I'm here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our healthcare system", he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government withdrawing almost half a billion dollars and the Australian Federation donating 300 million dollars and pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton has asked Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout package is spent on higher-level bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denise Diderot's novel, which offers an exceptional cinematic journey and a representation of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in 1860s France, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When he rebels, he experiences extreme cruelty from his depraved mother-in-law and becomes the object of sexual passion for another.
A film never slips to lust or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial nature of the story leads to the audience experiencing the agony of wearing a reed shirt.
Ski resorts want to make it cheaper for families with children
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed vital chemical weapons production facilities and poison gas munitions, the Global Monitoring Committee on Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, as fierce fighting erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where the toxic substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 civilians had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1st,
the deadline set by that organisation, based in The Hague, for Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all chemical weapons production facilities and machinery for mixing chemical substances to produce poison gas and to refill munitions.
The completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemical and weapons including yperite and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and a storage facility, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
An activist group that tracks the total death toll in Syria through its network of activists said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of that, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government side is said to include 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 members of Lebanon's Hezbollah.
The death toll also includes 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safir, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that casualties were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who face tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid the ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said that its team is now 'satisfied to have verified and monitored the destruction of Syria's declared essential production and blending/filling equipment'.
He added that  no further control activities are currently planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that these two sites were, according to Syria, abandoned and ... the chemical weapons programme items it contained were moved to two other declared sites which were checked.
It was not immediately clear whether the Sapphire facility was one of the places that OPCW inspectors were not allowed to visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had", said the director of the monitors, Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary released by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war is between mainly Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said that a powerful explosion occurred inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Laziqiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict on the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the perpetrators brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling the explosive device used in the bombing.
He could be on parole in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of a mass murder attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta that left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution sought life in prison, even though it could have insisted that the man known as the Demolition Man be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
This decision has brought back painful memories of June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other first-year students nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should be put to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Mrs. Corteen told the AAP he should be put in front of a firing squad.
Every day I have to live with not seeing any more of my grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari Club was razed to the ground when a high explosive device placed in a van parked outside was detonated shortly after 11pm on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
The explosion left him in a coma for a month, and while he was being kept alive, he was declared dead three times by doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jama'at Islamiyah responsible for the massacre of Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender willingly", said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has no regrets about the pain he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year", said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air travellers can now use technology on planes (but not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices  door-to-door  in addition to calling from their mobile phones  to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music under eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA the extent to which their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly, the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 2 miles and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft descends to land and not to turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and departure, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewardship Association, welcomed the changes.
Once the new rules are safely in place  and we will work closely with transport companies on this, it will be a success, Glading said in a statement.
We're getting really tired of looking like the Watchers.
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages, or downloading data will continue to be banned below 2 miles (3 kilometers) above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be advised to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So still no Words with Friends, the online game of Scrabble that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously kicked off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off his device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to be kept in storage for fear of injuring someone if they fly over the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for using cell phones are not set by the FAA, they're set by the Federal Communications Commission.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference with broadcast towers in the air", Rosenker said.
A professional advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month proposed that the government allow the widespread use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because of the widespread use of such devices.
Some studies suggest that as many as one third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to disruptions to navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
The new airlines rely on electrical systems far more than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes for several years.
Plans tailored for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to the increased use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Modern electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio emissions than previous generations.
For example, e-readers emit only minimal power when the page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when the device downloads or transmits data.
The Commission has also examined whether the aid measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a commercial airliner with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problems emerged.
The Commission has not received any comments from interested parties.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes that interference from these devices is real, even when the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their instruments during flight in low visibility.
The tourism industry group welcomed the changes and considered them to be a sensible course for the traveling public, which makes extensive use of technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience does not compromise safety", said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a North Sea rig and released back into the wild
The bird was brought to shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One of the crickets was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish SPCA at a rescue centre until he recovered.
Operations Center Colin Seddon said: "This cricket probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught in a strong wind over the North Sea".
Apparently, he ran out of strength and took refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help".
By the time the cricket was released, he was in good shape and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define the changes British business and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey to ask the UK's leading businesspeople what they think of Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe and are concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in a long and arduous process of reforming secretive European institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas  from monopoly regulation to product laws, most businesspeople expressed the view that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trading area  Even 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed.
And finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling insight, which is that a clear majority want Britain to seek a change in the treaty and relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding, which was shared by businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business sector is pushing for a 'meaningful change' that will bring the influence back to Britain.
The stakes are high  getting a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum vote on remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's EU membership.
This also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to represent a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible and even more necessary as the euro area embarks on a path towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as our survey results show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted that the spying had gone too far.
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London, AFP reported.
But the secretary said the intelligence gathering was used to deter terrorist attacks.
The "first admission from Washington" comes amid heated debate on both sides of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelations of a massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA) that has targeted US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that will not happen in the future", Kerry said.
But he was more of a defense of the practice.
He said that the collection of information is essential to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 and the London attacks of July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed about the problems in time", Kerry stressed.
However, it again admitted that the information gathering had 'in some cases gone too far'.
A scandal involving US intelligence that allegedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans were also monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders have made no secret of their outrage, and some have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is ushering in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, the head of Gazprom said.
"Today marks a milestone: Construction has started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian partners, which bring most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are 'always removed'.
Once the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a reduced price.
Gazprom says construction is due to start in other countries along the river later this year.
The pipeline is designed to carry 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters into Syria.
They're in for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous Kalamun region.
According to increasingly accurate reports, Israel destroyed missiles targeting Hezbollah in Wednesday's strikes on two sites in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also to fight Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but US sources have confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea area hit the Syrian missile base of Snubar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station says two warehouses were hit, where missiles were being prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is continually trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is training members of Hezbollah's armed wing to handle missiles.
SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, their mobility and small size make them easy to hide.
They're equipped with radar, but it turns off when the missile fires, making them hard to track.
Latakia is in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It's a heavily guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping protect the Syrian Shiite community, of which the Alawites are members.
Now, it is said that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help the army take back Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also reinforcing its forces there.
Kalamoun lies between Damascus and Homs, the country's third largest city.
The battle is said to be in retaliation for a recent opposition attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Abu Fadl Abbas Brigade in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army retake the town of Qusayr near the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusair have left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons cited included corruption, wasteful spending on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
The results of the elections show that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they didn't really care and that they were actually happy with the state of affairs.
I cannot explain otherwise that 3,413,497 voters did not show up, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS so a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
Which is a majority of over half.
If I add to the above parties 1 016 829 voters of the ČSSD, then with the old order (because all the parties mentioned participated in the "robbery" and indebtedness of this state), then with this state actually agreed 64.23% of the legitimate voters.
In fact, most voters have indicated that they are not in favor of punishing the perpetrators of the theft and over-indebtedness of this state.

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) have been charged in the prosecution of Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has learned that before charges were brought against caring carer Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse.
But it was reported to the committee that in its opening statement to the committee, the association stated that it had never dealt with a child sexual abuse case in its organization.
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another where a gymnast at Caringbah YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexually harassing children in his care.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, the committee's adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's initial statement was also inaccurate in stating that the YMCA had been subject to external audits that praised the organization as a leading advocate for children's rights.
The evidence presented by the committee suggests that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in an audit by the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him down failed when he hired Mr. Lord without making sure the staff were aware of their obligation to report violations of child safety regulations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during a two-year stint at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Mr. Lord's violation of children's safety.
Staff members have provided evidence that they have witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, keeping them under his wing, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and had requested child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was very intimidating and often difficult to talk to about anything.
The CEO said he doesn't accept evidence from staff that they felt uncomfortable contacting their superiors and reporting their actions.
Instead, he said their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, and that's why they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the New South Wales YMCA Council that the lesson for the organisation from the Jonathan Lord case was that staff had not reported, and the Council agreed.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the allegations came to light was made by YMCA's general manager of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid tampering with evidence, but it was "overzealous" and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse at Griffith University, told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe place for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems with recruitment, screening, recruitment, training and management of personnel.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In an evening interview to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade in the top job, Mr Blair has largely avoided talks on British politics, confining his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Middle East Peace Quartet envoy.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer in the London Evening Standard was quoted as: "Yes, of course, but that's probably not going to happen, is it, so...?"
As crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet in school and only taking his first steps a few months ago, this boy and his pet, a Shetland pony named Toffee, have slid three laps to finally win the grand prize, beating 30 adult competitors in a row.
This inseparable pair of  equal height  were commended for their looks, manners and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank riding centre in Rudra village near Cardiff.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in the fancy hats, tipped his beret at a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee stroll around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural horse-handling skills, far exceeding his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been training with this Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee work together great".
They didn't have high hopes, but they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only his second time competing with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded".
He ran across the sand the entire length of the arena and, despite his small appearance, he delivered a great performance.
Fenton is an animal lover who loves horses, tractors and the farm and has two chickens to look after.
Considering how he started, he's gonna be back in the Horse of the Year contest soon, and I'm sure he'll do just fine.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony".
They make a great team together.
The judges picked Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always see how good the teamwork is between the pony and the one leading it and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the cute clothes, really, really fit in there.
Too curious newspapers are to be investigated
A Chinese newspaper that asked for the release of a reporter accused of slander on its front page will be thoroughly investigated, the press secretary said.
Guangzhou-based New Express has made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The editor said the New Express will now make a complete overhaul.
The corrective order came from the State Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television of the Guangdong Province.
The provisional investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Evening News group published several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial staff of the New Express was disorganized", the editor said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his journalism license.
Furthermore, he directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete overhaul of the New Express, and recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the New Express be investigated and the management of the New Express be immediately changed.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two front-page petitions for his release, claiming to be behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to publishing false stories in exchange for the money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust", he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was after money and fame.
I realize I did the wrong thing.
After Mr. Chen apologized, the New Express published a front-page apology stating that he had failed to properly check his messages.
Recently, several highly-watched suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still being regularly forced, despite a law change this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug-smuggling tunnel has been found between the US and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric railroad.
U.S. authorities described the tunnel, measuring about three by four feet, as one of the most elaborate secret passageways they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds its way through the length of nearly six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, with San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is full of undefined warehouses where trucks can easily be hidden before they load with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was sealed off before drugs could be smuggled through.
Along with the tunnel discovery, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who authorities say were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating the vast drainage systems.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem for drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-meter-long corridor with rails that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The Economics and the Centre are linked by management.
For example, they'll offer a joint ad
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming the Centre Holding into its media house.
As of Friday, the Economy and the Center have a joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the staff union is essential for integrating the two publishers into a common media house", comments the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and the delegated CEO Kamil Čermák.
The Chairman, who will be the Head of Unit Management, will be replaced by the Executive Director of Centrum Holdings, Andreas Demuth.
The new joint manager of the store was appointed Pavel Vopařil, who is also in charge of the advertising manager of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová.
The new head of IT is Stefan Burda.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team includes the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
The newly created position of Marketing Director was given to Adele Pitts.
The separate corporate communications department is now run by Věra Lhotská.
The joint finance director is Karel Žalud, and the human resources management for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
'The new organisational structure will, among other things, enable us to enter the market with a common offer of advertising products, better link the content creation of all titles we publish and, last but not least, further streamline the company's commercial management significantly,' added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a purchase agreement for Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz servers, web portals, an extensive e-mail database under the Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz brands and the Najisto SMB agency or a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of the Economic newspaper, the news server IHNED.cz, the weeklies Respekt and Ekonom and a number of print and online B2B titles.
It is the most successful publisher in the Czech Republic in terms of digital sales of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CME is targeting the television business.
They're releasing almost a quarter of the people.
CME Media Group is going to fire.
He wants to lose a thousand people by the end of the year.
He's cutting out all his side business and focusing on his main business, television.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4 500 people.
That's almost a quarter of the people out there who lose their jobs.
The media group operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CET 21 is part of CME, which holds the broadcasting licences for the TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music channel MTV.
It is not yet clear how much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs around 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV network TV Nova.
"It's premature and we really can't comment", said Nova's communications director Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic are not inevitable, but by far the biggest impact should be on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Nova bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who have taken over from longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts Wednesday about their desire to curtail all activities not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce in particular the costs of producing its own programmes, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a cooling tower burned down last night.
A large-capacity magazine was on fire in the Czech Republic's Prague industrial park, apparently a cooling tower.
"The firefighters arrived at the fire on Thursday before 11 pm and put it out this morning", said Pavlína Adamcová, a spokeswoman for the Prague Fire Department.
The amount of harmful substances in ambient air measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and cause of the fire are unknown.
About five dozen firefighters arrived at the Kolben Street compound.
"It's a large-capacity storage tank fire, probably a cooling tower", said Adamc.
"There is no functioning fire hydrant network in the area, so we use the pipes from the tanks", she added.
According to tn.cz, the fire was complicated by a malfunctioning hydrant network, so the firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire chief has issued a second-degree fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, with the most severe being the fourth.
Chemists were sent to the scene to check the amount of hazardous substances that could have been released into the air during the fire.
"But they did not detect any contaminants in the air that exceeded hygienic standards", said a fire department spokeswoman.
British police have served Assange with an extradition notice.
British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a "notice of extradition" to a 40-year-old Australian man, asking him to report to the police station and threatening him with arrest if he did not.
Assange has exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month threw out his extradition appeal, and he faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges.
Fearing extradition from Stockholm, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum in that South American country.
Scotland Yard has served a notice of extradition to a 40-year-old man asking him to report to the police station on the day and time set for him, a spokesman said.
Assange is continuing to violate his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could face espionage charges for publishing 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a glass of booze between his thighs.
At Colchester Police Court Howie pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving and negligent driving.
He was awarded seven points, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a surcharge of £100 to the defendant.
The London bubble is bursting with a tax on foreign property owners.
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the income of financial assets but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced a 7% property transfer fee in the 2012 budget for buildings above £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company rather than as individuals.
The income from the transfer fee in the housing stock in the counties of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: Given the increase in the transfer of high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is undertaxed despite the effect of the outdated head tax system.
He added that this move might have made some foreign investors reluctant to buy London properties or to sell existing owners.
The top real estate  top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price  in the wealthy belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady year-on-year increase of 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by a booming 'domestic market', where Savills' survey shows the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) saw increases.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements affect a dog's mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from a dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wag their tails more to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can sense and respond to these subtle differences in tail movements.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different responses to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions".
We've been trying to find the same thing in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handedness and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the disproportionate wagging of other dogs' tails, researchers monitored animals watching other dogs' movies.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long to understand why their tails go one way and the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown dogs films about dogs, either in the natural version or in silhouette, to remove any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the tail movement to show it more to the right or left".
When the animals saw the otherwise inconspicuous dog wagging its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view wagging its tail), they remained completely calm.
But when she noticed the tail turning mostly to the left (again from the dog's tail wagging view), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and must not watch.
He said, "If you meet a dog several times and the tail movements in one direction are repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and the movement to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond based on that experience".
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their pets' emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a veterinary professor at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides of dogs are important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to be introduced to a robot dog when it wagged its tail left than right, when it became more insecure -- the exact opposite of the Italian study".
He said the difference may be that dogs in these different studies of the animals in the movies or the dog robots didn't behave quite like dogs.
He explained that a study of how dogs react to real dogs might help.
Although there is strong evidence that in many different mammals, both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified  and dogs are no exception, he said.
But because of how easy it is to observe their behavior, it may not take long to understand why their tails sometimes turn to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys have postponed their Glasgow show due to Alex Turner 's illness .
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a show in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with a sore throat.
The Sheffield band was supposed to play at the Hydro complex on Friday.
But lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to postpone the show.
The group's announcement came after they were similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys say: "Following the decision to postpone today's show at the LG Arena in Birmingham and following medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone their show at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1st".
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a sore throat and unfortunately will not be able to perform.
The show will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on 20 November and the Hydro Complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for this concert remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church, second only to the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men to help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80 and is no longer eligible to vote in the election of the pope, the group thus shrinks to 120 cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of current cardinals, known as a consistory, would precede the solemn elevation of new cardinals.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate planning for other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as are needed to increase the number of voters back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance", he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope made all the decisions for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that these cardinals would be asked for advice by the Pope.
But we've never been in this situation before. It's completely new.
Valero said the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from high places to the cardinalate, but Francis is full of surprise so we don't know who he's appointing.
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the U.S. for repair of seat backs.
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Administration, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual lever flap fault.
In some of these vehicles, the front seat folding mechanism may be defective.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that if a vehicle is hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect the occupant, increasing the risk of injury.
The models withdrawn were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched the vehicle in June and it is the most important vehicle launch for the leading US automaker since its restructuring after its bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van about the malfunction in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review owner notifications due to a 16-day government shutdown that weakened auto sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras from its supply.
New York stock market shares rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The desperate cry of Obama voters
I voted for Obama twice. I shared the hope of a possible change.
He says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted Republican Party obstruction.
Obstructionist politics cannot excuse the suffering of Obama's health care website or drone attacks.
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me during the dark days of my second year in medical school and give me a glimmer of hope.
It's called The Audacity to Win, and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide, and the television news made us reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they had obtained.
A young team of visionaries was heading to the White House, and the nation was ready for a change.
When he took office in 2008, Obama had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And this is where I close the book.
Going into the present is a rough wake-up call, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days... they seem like distant memories, sad reminders of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, things have really changed.
It was definitely not what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes -- from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq to ending the "don't ask, don't tell" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that partisan obstruction has thwarted so many efforts to move our nation forward: among others, immigration reform, public health care choice, and closing the base at Guantanamo.
But after many occasions of defending the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and friends, I've reached the absolute limit of what they can offer.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the authorization of wiretapping foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They don't explain why the NSA collects data on the private lives of Americans, or why it goes after those who expose government malpractice.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process of law, or for curbing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the report's finding that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more aggressive... than the Nixon administration".
And most recently, they can't even excuse their failure to create a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if I could have expected anything like this.
Did I realize at 18 that government power could conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it?
Elected office obviously has no predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unpolished alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we'd heard about before.
Yet going back to 2008  with Obama's support falling below 45% this week  through this book is getting harder.
It makes me remember all the promises that have been broken.
I read a chapter in a book this week about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he needed to get back on track and stay true to his mission.
"I want our spell back", he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program.
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave scheme because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
A mining tycoon who is fighting a $6 million coal tax bill made the claim in an effort to remove the question of whether he has a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which will play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether they got parental leave", Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after counting the votes, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the race for the Fairfax County seat on the Sunshine Coast, by a margin of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls close?
"We must have a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, type in the details, vote instantly and get the results at 7:30 at night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it that the results can be erased if someone doesn't like them?
In this day and age, using a pencil seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political agenda extended to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job very seriously.
Public office is a public service.
"We seek no reward other than to serve society at this critical time", he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have found that hand washing can change your mood.
The experiment involved 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an unsolvable problem.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failing seemed much more optimistic than the group that didn't.
The "hand washing" group also performed better than the other group on another test.
Yet, those who washed their hands performed worse on other tests than those who did not.
The results of the wash were at the level of the third group, whose participants had no previous failure.
The results of the test indicate, according to psychologists, that physical cleanliness really does remove negative feelings after failure.
But at the same time, motivation decreases, and test subjects have to focus a lot more on the next test.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, I think the most optimistic we'd be when we got back from the bathroom.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs do not wash their hands, but after using public transportation, it is one fifth.
They also tend to stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Cuddling a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference between the Czech and Slovak perceptions of the need to wash one's hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about 10 times a day.
"While this would be appropriate, I am afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better", commented dermatologist Klaudie Komárková on the results of the survey.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, another indication that global investigations by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the relevant authorities in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expanding investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) manipulation scandal.
The Bank declined to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our tireless investigation into the matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the incident said that RBS had handed over to the UK Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Exchange Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash trading at Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of foreign exchange trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these merchants have been charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher's group of instant messengers included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced it was investigating suspicious foreign exchange market manipulation in several Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are investigating allegations that these bankers conspired to manipulate the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks are sifting through years of old instant messages and emails to find any cases of wrongdoing.
Reports of the investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines for generating profit in investment bank closings in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small currency volatility limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that may not necessarily be true.
A senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing use of their own internal platforms means that you can start influencing the market at relatively low prices.
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a stock trader from its trading department this week who had caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the problem has been solved", Credit Suisse said.
HIV infection in Prague has exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1,005 people in the metropolitan area.
This is according to statistics from the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Institutes of Health.
According to the report, 2,063 cases have been reported in the Czech Republic.
396 of the immunodeficiency disease has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year for the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed 50 people with the infection, and five years later, there were 121.
In 2009, 156 new diseases were detected, and in 2010, 180 were detected.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
Lab says there were 212.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year", says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years headed the Prague House of Light for patients.
From October to the end of 2011, tests detected the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said Head.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three female patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, 1,710 men and 353 women tested positive for HIV.
The AIDS outbreak was reported in 161 men and 37 women.
Most of the infected were in Prague.
If you really want to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
A visit to it reveals more than a stroll through the paved center of monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bed sheet would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
They slowly wander the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what kind of people live there, what nationalities they are, what their faiths are, how large and cohesive their families are, how old they die there, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social standing, what their tastes are.
And they'll also learn from the condition of the graves how their dead are cared for.
The Supreme Court has upheld Obamacare.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5-4, the court ruled that the individual provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  that requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine  is not unconstitutional based on government tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining portions of the 2,700-page law, further ruling that the statutory requirement for health care that requires states to expand access to health insurance or risk losing all federal health insurance funding is not mandatory and unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses to block the law.
During the 2012 primary, the bill was strongly rejected by every major Republican candidate, including the presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney.
"Mugabe is a lame ass" is no longer a prison sentence, court rules out
So far, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about how they speak in public about the 88-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has been at the helm since late 1987.
Under Section 33 of the Penal Code, contempt of the office of the president was punishable by a fine of $100 and up to one year in prison.
"Prosecutors should not be eager to accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places", the Constitutional Court said.
The nine-judge panel unanimously ruled that the law undermines free speech.
The government is likely to appeal the court's decision, reports Britain's BBC.
The law was strongly opposed by a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist was jailed for publicly insulting Mugabe with the term "a lame donkey".
In August, the prosecutor charged a 26-year-old man with the intent to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared the law restricting media freedom unconstitutional.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements are later shown to be false", said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law had allowed for a 20-year prison sentence for publishing false information.
"The existence of a law that allows criminalising someone for making a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to free speech", Malala added.
Despite Mugabe's rule of the country with a heavy hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
The country took small steps towards a one-man dictatorship in 2009 when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister's chair.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from an economic crisis and inflation, which topped 100,000 percent in 2008, was the highest in the world.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is only used for foreign currency.
The impoverished economy is being squeezed by Mugabe's reckless agricultural reforms.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience in running a farm.
The central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need it.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible move", commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.
"So far, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so I think this is not surprising", adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are tightening the bonds that began to form in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
The central bank agreements made it possible for anyone who needed to have access to euros, dollars and other currencies.
The central bankers' decision comes as the US Federal Reserve prepares to end its stimulus program for the US economy, which could push the price of money higher in the global market.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome a liquidity shortfall in one currency while another currency has an excess of liquidity.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport deletes personal data
Over a year ago, I signed up for Tipsport.com.
I didn't finish it because someone at the branch was sitting there who couldn't complete the online registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration was canceled, and then I moved, and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I couldn't because I had a different OP number, address and that I just couldn't complete it and that I should request a data erasure and re-register.
So I did, and on October 24, 2013, I wrote to technical support requesting that all of my personal information be deleted from the database under applicable privacy laws.
So tech support texted me the other day to complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of emails to technical support, where finally after the fourth urgency on October 25th, they wrote that they had deleted my personal data at my request.
So you'd think you could do that new registration and then the problems started again. First it said my username was already taken (I understand it wasn't deleted - it's not personal information, but they finally deleted this one too).
So I used a different username and it occurred to me that my personal information was already saved to complete the branch registration (how can they have saved something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how this was possible, they told me that the personal data had indeed been deleted on October 25th and to send an e-mail with the error.
I did (about 3 pm yesterday) and they replied today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 1.22 pm and that it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What if I contact tech support for a week and I'm still not getting through?
And what if what they say is true (and it's not) that no one with the same name or the same date of birth can register if they're already registered.
By the way, at 1:22 p.m., I actually registered, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake email and phone number, and, God knows, a page popped up that sent me an email link to complete the registration.
But how is that possible when you can't register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport tied the registration to an email and phone number and didn't just delete the dates like they said.
So I told tech support again that they're just lying (either intentionally or they don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing isn't true.
I've logged a few screenshots that the registration problem was already there before October 31st, so the fake registration just doesn't affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a stern sentence - I'm sorry, but since you're already re-registered, we can't verify your claims.
And he cut off communication.
It repeats the same sentence over and over again, that registration is bound by name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in the email, and so it didn't actually happen.
So, to sum it up, Tipsport not only didn't delete the data as he claims, but he's lying when he says otherwise.
What's worse is that they can be easily proven to be lying and trying to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after I posted this on my personal blog, things got a little bit moving and an email came from Technical Support saying they're forwarding the issue for verification and I'll be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and being warned about the same error).
There's music playing on the bridge
The Transport Enterprise of Prague (DPP) has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first lobby, where instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the A-line bridge at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will last for six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
The composer Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne City Social House not only his brand new two-CD Czech calendar, but especially in the program Among Us singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Rum Ondrule accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benka Orchestra.
After the introductory intro and the acting etudes about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and the entire city went without electricity.
"There were two types of cards that were made in Cologne, and I came into contact with them a lot", he recalls.
He also reminded me of President Zeman's compatriot.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dubravka near Bratislava", he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times during the evening, Horáček, who never left the stage and who, when not speaking, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
Josef Manes made the calendar, put it on his watch, but he didn't know about ice hockey, how we meet in those squares and chant, who doesn't jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing it here today", he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a very suitable song for him from this album, Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompany her on guitar.
When he did not sing, he played percussion, and all three singers were accompanied by a band of keyboard, cello, guitar, and double bass.
All three singers sang a little song together, "To the Side of the Heart Sits", which immediately rocked the audience.
"I'm glad you liked the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town", Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapk, I recognize in the performance of Franz Segrad, originally by Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge applause, Hannu Heger was reminded of the song Dad liked Lida Baarova with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and Baar's replacement by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of Sebastian, Segrado then sang the beautiful song Prague, sung by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zámuc and former Kolínák.
That was the end, standing ovation and the addition of the upbeat song "We Live in Wonderful Times".
There was one more song on the playlist, but the fans didn't applaud it anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole quartet sat down at a table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also an older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover of the legendary LP and took a photo with any interested parties.
Berdych and Stjepanek are joined by Rosol and Hajek.
In the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis team Jaroslav Navrotil nominated the foursome Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech Republic are defending their trophy, but they will play their opponents in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going into hot ground, it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performance as always".
"We go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best", said Stepanek, the winner of last year's final against Spain.
The secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American command in Libya.
Top gun in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what bombing Syria should look like.
Without any fuss, without any threats, without millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and they came back.
Without being swayed by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole thing and they're not commenting anymore.
The exact opposite of the confused and big-mouthed, unsupported actions of Obama's Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying part of the whole attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Don't be fooled by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "Hezbollah supplies" were bombed.
I wrote here recently that while U.S. aid to the secular rebels in the country remains at a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply Syria with weapons.
And just recently, a shipment of Russian missiles, landed in the port of Latakia, was the target of an Israeli airstrike.
I'm not going to lie.
And notice, again, Israel bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although popular Internet theories suggest it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has identified two members of the Space Force, possibly Delta Force.
Little did we know they were conspicuous in the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
It's well known that two former SEALs died heroically defending a CIA compound in the city, and I believe they were members of a covert CIA commando unit made up of former soldiers.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA residence elsewhere.
It's clearer now.
However, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (on one of these, both SEALs were killed by mortar fire) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about these two as yet unknown heroes.
They were part of the American command in Tripoli, and as soon as they got word of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, they cleared their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is confused that during that attack, the team wasn't fully deployed and they were just hesitating.
Commander, without orders, he'll probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that there's a U.S. commando, CIA agents and private contractors operating in the country on a regular basis, not a one-off, is pretty interesting information.
And that's because until recently, there was no official acknowledgement of any such thing, and even now, there's talk of some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the U.S. is doing even half the fighting on terrorism in Libya.
Although, to solve a nationwide situation, it would take a lot more help.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is off the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian air force for chasing American drones.
But little is known about how effectively the Americans protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to spot your drone in the air, there's nothing you can do about it.
But when an Iranian drone is spotted in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom was pursuing a U.S. drone in international airspace over the sea, in what may have been the first major deployment of an American F-22 Raptor super fighter in history.
He flew past the Phantom to optically verify its armament without the Phantom detecting it on radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without a murmur.
No wonder, since the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that is reminiscent of the Vietnam War.
It's no match for the Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, Rajtoral promises
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well lately, the defender or defender of Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He's good at shooting, he's active, he was given a penalty kick after surgery in Teplice.
Victoria reached for the victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice, but ultimately took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break the unpleasant series in the game against Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we can beat the Apple at home", promises Francis Rajtoral.
The men are preparing for a tough match against the North Czechs, who play attacking football.
Everything is heading towards the game against Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great game on Friday night", the Czech representative is luring fans to the Doosan Arena grandstands.
The last few games have not gone as she would have liked, but the word of crisis the defender Victoria refuses.
That's football, sometimes you're in good shape, sometimes you're in bad shape.
But I wouldn't talk about a crisis under any circumstances.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again", the West German defender said.
Victoria's men will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great".
"I believe we will repay them with a win", Rajtoral adds.
I'm not going to say that.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big leap -- a leap back a few years, back into my memories, back into my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and do the dishes and do the laundry and do the homework.
Although these "duties" were mostly theoretical, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - running from school, throwing a bag in the corner, and running out.
Play ball games with the other kids, hop a drink.
Then on the show, Helena and her boys sewing a chain-stitch napkin for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings, finally wash the dishes, unload, put wood in the fireplace in winter and do homework under the lamp until it gets dark (or rely on a classmate and write love poems to a school sweetheart instead of homework).
To have homemade strawberry jam in the morning (made from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, which didn't even have strawberries in them) and drink it with the dried herbal tea that my mom and I used to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the little room, when my sister and I would record songs from the radio on cassettes that played loudly on my mom's old tape recorder.
And then we would play the tapes on the pencil and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and drink to it with siphon.
Or we would use cans of paper to make phone calls over the table, which were tied together with a rope - and when we were talking about making phone calls, to hear each other better, we had to clean our ears thoroughly, the earwax being match + cotton.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live off it without lacking anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads, or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothes were passed down from generation to generation, and the best addition to the wardrobe was a batik shirt made in-house with the help of SAVA.
In electronics, we were satisfied with just the one I mentioned, my mother's cassette player, and at best, the Walkman that my sister and I shared, which we used on the train on our school trip, by the way.
We thought it would be more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, I beg your pardon, or as I said, just go out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, which I'm sure my parents had been saving for a long time, but unfortunately, it didn't last long in our house.
My little sister put a piece of strudel in it, said it was so good at popping the tapes, she tried to see if it could pop the strudel.
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but that was his last bite.
Well, he still has that story, poor thing, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says when Lenka was little, she threw a strudel in the video and thought she'd play the recipe and she didn't, which is why she can't bake it to this day.
I remember how we could all communicate, make arrangements without cell phones, computers.
My sister and I were on vacation at my grandmother's house, and we arranged with the granddaughter of the neighbor to meet at her grandmother's next summer - and that was it, that was it.
We're all together.
Promise someone you'll see them in a year?!
I also remember the winter when the whole village and I would run outside, build snowmobiles, ride up the snow-covered hill by the church on bags of hay.
Then we all had dinner together as a family, talking about the day.
Of course, before every meal, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, it's still true today, but you certainly don't have lemon-net soap tied to the faucet in your bathroom.
After dinner, while Dad was "working" in the garage with Jarda from the village, we lay on the floor with Mom, leaning our feet against the tiled stove, opening the door, and looking at the flame and listening to the crackling of wood that was falling from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many social networking friends we had, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't text each other every day through different chat rooms, text messages.
Nothing like that happened, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially when I supplement those memories by going through albums of black and white photos neatly pasted together by black corners.
And in case I don't know how old I was at the time, the year it was taken is always written on the back of the photo.
I see that although our haircut was not very good according to the pot and we wore two sizes larger cousin's pants, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward, to reality.
I'll wait until 2013 to see what the modern age will come up with for my kids.
What I do know is that these memories of mine are now at least somewhere in the "hundred years after the monkeys" for the younger generation of teenagers, and I think they're missing out on a lot of the "re-baking" time.
I wish they had!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
A group that owns thousands of expired Nortel patents filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone makers including Google, a company it had overbid in an auction for Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, is suing Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents involve technology that helps link Internet search terms to relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, which is at the core of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is in strong competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial public offering for Nortel's patents.
Google raised its offer several times, eventually going up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in a patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patent pool.
Despite its failure to auction off the disputed patents, Google has infringed and continues to infringe on patents, the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, according to Rockstar, Google is intentionally infringing, as the claim claims.
Miloslav Cejpková: November smile is a great way to start your day.
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
First, she put aside the smile, the one she kept putting on as a defense against a supposedly friendly environment.
That was a big relief, because it was a mask she chose not to wear in public.
He was only honest at home on days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Adiq around.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered the lesson of endless courses of business skills.
Now they're finally coming in handy.
To keep her loved ones from being upset.
Then he went into a corner.
It's like a costume in a costume shop.
November, no other month can do the miracle of making her smile like when they were on a trip with someone who's been gone for almost three years.
Egypt inaugurates first freely elected president
Muhammad Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his triumphal day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, following the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a palace built overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by governments for most of its 84 years as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's era, traffic was only briefly halted to allow the convoy to pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige, derisively labelled the uncharismatic reserve tire of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown dramatically since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him as not only the candidate of Islamists but also of all those who want to end the uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in a wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
While standing guard, he received a formal welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of the armad and the people are one hand from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Cairo University was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to reclaim the presidential powers taken from him by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office in court rather than in parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the military, suggesting that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos to defuse the tension.
In the future, police specialists should be working in the ghettos of the Czech Republic.
They'd spend half their errands here.
They'd keep order and solve problems.
With their environmental knowledge, they should help to reduce tensions between people from poor areas and neighbouring communities.
The Home Office has taken this into account in its proposal to reduce security risks.
He said that the main thing that would help improve the situation in the country would be "accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They had 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families depended on benefits, children were sent to "special" schools.
It was usury.
Experts say the number of trouble spots has increased by a hundred.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are strained.
In several places, anti-Roman marches took place.
The extremists were joined by neighbors.
According to the Internal Affairs, it's difficult for police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
The basic condition is 'the consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement'.
But that's impossible without a detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
The specialist would go on assignments in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest in his district.
He'd be in charge of the cleanup at the trouble spot.
He'd also know the locals, so he could better handle problems or transgressions.
'Through this trust, professionals will be better able to prevent a range of wrongdoing,' the insider said.
Ghetto specialists would get a bonus of 500 to 1,000 crowns a month.
The deployment of special police in problem areas is to be financed from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now about CZK 15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The writers were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem of socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements", the report said.
It is not yet clear how many specialists should be in the Czech Republic.
The answer is to provide an analysis that will identify the locations where a special agent would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police can release each year for these staff after the project is over.
The project proposal calls for the first selected police officers to undergo a training course in Slovakia.
The training should be provided to five dozen members per year.
They'll turn out to be the best candidates.
Special training should also be provided for police officers who will be working in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would be the main way to improve the situation.
It's supposed to motivate and lead to integration.
The idea of the interior would be three categories.
The minimum standard would be accommodation with strict rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard should be provided for social housing comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to follow an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to comply with housing regulations, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively seek employment.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of living.
The internal proposal is that the transitional housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation grows up 'in a pro-integration environment'.
The model of social housing is prepared by the local development and labour departments.
They're supposed to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Coal Mountain - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Coal Hill is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Aegean in a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Viewed from a greater distance, the striking white-washed Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Helpful, built in 1755-1765, is on the top of the Uhlířský vrch.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that was next to the church didn't hold up.
Shortly after the church was completed, a four-lane alleyway was laid out, about a mile long.
The Way of the Cross on the Coal Hill is the third version, the original one was here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
The 15 stops are decorated with wooden sculptures by local artist-sculptor František Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the area of the Low Autumn.
Similarly, the rock outcrops of the area provide an interesting geological exposure.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated on each stop.
The coal ridge is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although radiometric dating varies slightly, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Red Sea (at 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (at 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born of an explosion.
It spewed a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with rock fragments from the bedrock, which were burnt to a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous sediment up to 43 feet [13 m] thick.
The second eruption spewed red, brownish-red and, in places, black tuff.
Their layer is up to 50 meters thick and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
The tuff contains conspicuous volcanic pumas up to three feet [1 m] in size, and the second eruption was also completed by lava flows.
The volcano's activity culminated in the release of lava, which today forms a 50-meter-high [50 m] layer of stony sediment.
Volcanoes that alternate between volcanic ash and lava flows are the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made of layers, they're called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone gradually eroded.
But it was only threatened by quarrying in the south side quarry.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuff was added to the concrete, which was lighter and had better insulation properties.
Under pressure from experts and the public, the mining was stopped to preserve this unique site.
The problem, however, is that the porous and low-density rocks wind up quickly, break up, and slide down the slope.
The fracture goes away pretty quickly.
To complicate matters, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal location for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain the characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained at a number of key sites.
You can reach the Coal Hill by following the green tourist sign from Bruntal or from Silesian Kočov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the alley where the short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the penthouse.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a tenement villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of Prague's most beautiful villas on the Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house were restored to it in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
So Ivana quickly sought a substitute home for herself and her aged mother.
She got a tip from friends about a 3+1 apartment in an older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"At first, it was a shock, but the view of the vast forest park and dam on the other side from the fourth floor thrilled me", recalls Ivan.
At first I thought it was a temporary job for three years.
"We have lived here for more than 13 years now, and I would not change it just to renovate it", adds the owner.
A mother and daughter had moved from a 200-foot apartment to a smaller, 200-square-foot [62 m2] one, and they had given away almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, the items were stored at friends' houses and the gradual preparation took almost a year.
The new apartment was in fairly good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting the doors and replacing the windows.
The previous owner had demolished the core, but the owner was most troubled by the unnecessarily large and impractical hallway and the small bathroom.
The two rooms are joined together to create a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to delimit the zones and divide the room, allowing for new lighting.
The first thing she did after a few years was remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2+ sqm, but the room gained airiness and opened up a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring with laminate.
She didn't know what to do with Ivan's bathroom.
I've been subscribing to housing magazines for years, looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting implementation in one of them.
So I contacted a young architect named Kamilla Doudera.
"It was actually the most important step forward", says Ivan.
The bathroom was also remodeled to accommodate the lobby.
The architect combined the bathroom and the bathroom and replaced the two doors with sliding doors, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
The high-quality linings mimic the sandstone, plus a comfortable shower seat, a bidet shower by the toilet.
The successful collaboration with Kamilla Doudera continued.
As part of the program, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without using the classic principles of optical partition, like diagonals or Japanese walls.
"This would end up violating the openness and uniformity of the space", explains the architect.
The original plan was to separate the bedroom and living room.
All you had to do was turn two sofas back to back and place a custom-made blanket box between them.
The dining area defines the floor shades and paintwork.
The architect used high-quality marble on the kitchen floor and dining area, and she brought the sliding door to life with patterned wallpaper.
The kitchen corner is covered with sliding wallpaper panels if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate floor: a smoother, non-slip surface without seams and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and recesses made of plasterboard, highlighted with colour, is an example of how space can be worked with in a panel.
I left the painting to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, the same shade I had in my previous apartment", says Ivan.
The graphite panel with the motif of magnolia in bloom is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white to emphasize the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, the books were stored in a space under the window sill.
Everything is within reach, the lights are conveniently remote controlled.
The new interior is a fine contrast to the old, with decades-old crystal chandeliers and fine art objects that Ivan has collected throughout his life.
Last to go was the kitchen.
The lockers were previously placed on either side, and the owner felt a little like a tunnel.
The architect took the number down and rearranged the layout.
The simple design of the furniture is custom made, the white surface is smoothed by a slightly pearly surface.
The idea of a washer, dryer, and washing machine made them fit in a small space.
The look of the small kitchen was brought to life by the glass paneling of the walls above the worktop.
The unique graph glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive and also very durable.
Ivan chose magnolia flowers that reminded her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
The original bathroom had a small bathtub and sink, so the new owner chose a neutral shade of upholstery.
The big shower corner has a glass door, Ronal.
The challenge was to create a clear, simple space in which the functions and devices would be in harmony.
We've combined the interior materials and colors to try to make it look elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"Another condition for the order was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday items", adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court ruled that sometimes you can sue.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by the immunity granted to him for speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Schneider and Peter Tluchoura, on the other hand, it ruled that they could not be punished for any crimes until they renounced their parliamentary mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
The court rejected the motion of the Prosecutor, Ivan Ishtvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings against the MPs.
He said they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies to give up their mandate and not cause problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be prosecuted.
With Vitaly Barta, they also arrested an officer of the anti-corruption police.
Bart's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of MEPs, also declined to comment on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent my client in this case as well, but due to the protection of classified facts I cannot comment further".
According to the information received, the case is being handled by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS).
The tn.cz server said that Bart could have been buying classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizprava.cz, the case may be related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post Bart allegedly sought.
But the latest information from the Law Office shows that the detention of Vit Barty is not related to Peter Lessi.
Police spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague city council.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of classified facts", said on Friday Pravda spokeswoman of the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague, Štěpánka Zenklová.
It is the prosecutor there who is overseeing Bart's case, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her words that the file or the criminal proceedings are being conducted in secret mode.
A reporter from Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vit Bart Katerina Klasová in the morning outside their home in the Prague suburb of Klaárová.
She was just packing up and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn Movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke out about Bart's arrest.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Welcome Bart was one of many candidates from many parties on our candidacy, and as I have said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura", he added.
Witaj Bart, who ran unsuccessfully for Tomia Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy in the recent early elections to the House of Representatives in the Plzeň region, is known for his corrupt case of bribing MPs of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months suspended to 30 months.
The verdict was later overturned, and Bart was acquitted.
I want to sign with the NHL.
♪ I still have the juice, the lust and the enthusiasm ♪
For Prospala, family has always been first, so she wants to be completely submissive at 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and gets a career break, or he's out of hockey for good.
"I want to be a father and a husband".
"I'm really looking forward to it", says the hockey player, still waiting in vain for the offer.
Even though he's a hard worker who never cheats.
Even though he always leaves a heart on the ice and can rip off teammates.
And that's despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still there", he declares resolutely.
He may be, as the New York Rangers are reportedly after him, who have had a disappointing start to the season and two injured cornerbacks, Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How's it looking coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in looking into it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere else is it said that this actually happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but I just don't.
You haven't heard from the club?
This kind of communication happens every day in the NHL.
That's where it's all about getting into a situation where the deal really comes through.
When a player gets hurt or someone else can't play and the team can't play.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get me this contract.
But in New York, it's just the same kind of circumstances, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan, and the team's not making the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always that chance.
But the other thing is, you always need two sides to it.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live with.
You're flying to America on Friday, expecting something to work out?
I've had these expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened up the free agent market, and still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
I'm going to Tampa to see my wife and kids.
I'm looking forward to the sunshine and seeing you again.
Do you have a schedule?
It's a gift of being a father and a husband, and that's where it all comes from.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be a father and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Your father has two hockey games on Sunday, so it's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
You think you could do this in quotes full-time?
Yeah, well, you can think of a lot of things.
This could happen.
I tried that three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
It gets to a point where all the goals, wins and losses don't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and kids, that's the meaning of life.
You can have any job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me outside of my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
As a hockey player, my priority - besides my family - is sporting success.
The NHL is the best league in the world.
And that's where family life comes in.
My children, I mean, excuse me, our children -- my children and my wife -- grew up in the States, went to school there, and so on.
And we would love to see them continue that trend.
Because as we're about to tell ourselves, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should give them that chance.
So you plan on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we've been doing.
That means we'll be in Bohemia in the summer on Hluboké and around Český Budějovice.
And in the winter, we'll be back in Tampa or wherever our footsteps take us.
It's perfect, being warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
I mean, I went to meet him, and it took a lot of effort and sacrifice and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has given me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this so they can choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard, and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have that in me today, that juice, that lust, that enthusiasm, that passion for the sport, that desire and motivation to prove to people that you're still in the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's gonna stay there.
It's not something you can plan.
So you're saying you're gonna wait this season and see how it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm in the day-to-day phase.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the measures in question.
He explained that he was waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of the Contract of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. as the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
I only rule with Saturday.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to have one.
The president of the ANO admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will be published tomorrow.

Police have evacuated a section of the Los Angeles airport due to a shooting.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police have evacuated a section of the airport, reportedly Terminal 3.
Reuters, citing California media, says law enforcement officers shot a gunman.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, reported that a shootout had occurred, injuring two or three TSA officers.
How many people were injured and if there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about a more casual event.
CNN: Israel has bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was supposed to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press has reported extensively on the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the raid when asked by CNN.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports", she said.
The target of the Israeli strike was a US government source who said the missiles and related equipment were believed by the Israelis to be likely to be transported to the Lebanese militant movement Hezbollah.
The Associated Press, citing another US security official, reported that the targets of the Israeli strike on a target in Syria were Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israeli TV channel 2 reported that the attack was reportedly targeted by a highly advanced Syrian air defense system.
But satellite imagery from the area of the attack, according to DPA, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they said they could see the batteries of the SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
The missiles, according to an Israeli television report, have a range of 22 miles [35] and can carry warheads weighing up to 130 pounds [70 kg].
Israel has reportedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and the AP reported.
The IDF has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will strike any arms shipment to Hezbollah or other designated terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from recreationalists in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be between USD 325 and 340 million, compared to the USD 305 to 315 million forecast.
If current trends are maintained, this will represent an increase of 12 to 17% compared to the record profit of USD 290,4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made an eight per cent profit in the first half and had started a strong second half growth, particularly in non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record annual profits before interest and taxes", he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which have traditionally been our biggest profit-makers.
Leisure business in Australia recovered during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the leisure sector, while corporate clients spent less.
US trade has rebounded from a loss in a seasonally weak first half and is expected to return to full-year profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Center shares were up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September for protesting against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP today, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original accusation of piracy against its activists has not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia following a non-violent crackdown on an Arctic oil rig have been transferred from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg", the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the transfer of the detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, it was a planned transfer.
The environmental authorities initially charged them with piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced they were replacing the charge with a lesser charge of rioting, which carries a reduced sentence of up to seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace issued a statement today warning that the authorities have not yet pulled back on the piracy charges they promised.
He says that means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Investigative Committee announced last week that it would replace the piracy charge with the riot charge.
But when 30 prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone", Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, a Dutch-flagged vessel.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, which they appealed against, but the court rejected.
Environmentalists are complaining about the conditions in the prison.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg will facilitate meetings with detainees' families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse", he pointed out.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the report, he claims that Maliki has played a major role in the resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he says is also partly a result of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, you will be required to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include hidden text to motivate further reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a language final exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula for English and math tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other core subjects are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the final exams, will reveal changes to the structure of the final examination, together with a new grading system and a reduced volume of projects for students.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was broad consensus on whether we needed to reform our examination system to regain public confidence and that we needed to insist that the final exam be "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math -- 116 hours a year, or three hours a week -- than most other countries.
By comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on mathematics, and in Singapore, about 138.
While there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that including a high school math exam  along with a greater emphasis on the subject in the scoreboards  is likely to encourage schools to provide additional instruction.
The curriculum will focus more on real-world problems, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the CPSU
Before the elections, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostrava-based ČSSD was in full swing.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, took the case to court for undemocratic candidate selection.
The actors in the case did not want to comment on this, however, lest they hurt the party even more before the election.
But now the votes are counted.
The Ostrava ČSSD leadership called on the mayor of Ostrava to resign from the party on Monday evening, and will likely press for him to lose his position.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the dispute is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Daily.
How do you see the election outcome?
I'm sure the CSI was counting on a much better outcome.
Did she suffer at home because of the media coverage of the party's internal disputes before the election?
I can imagine social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state of the CSA now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, it's sick inside, and people feel that everything is not right.
They made that very clear in the election.
What are these internal diseases of the SSC?
I think the ODS has been in decline for some time now and unfortunately, similar things are happening in social democracy.
It's that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebenders in the ODS, have moved to the people in the ČSSD and have influence on them.
It's related to the police going around the Ostrava magistrates' offices collecting computers.
It shows that the CSA is not just made up of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague as seen in the current power struggle between the Hashkoviks and the Sobotkoviks.
But even that has been a long time coming.
What happened before the election in Ostrava was just a foreshadowing of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hague wing gradually took positions, so that after the election, it could create a situation that would weaken the Sabotk wing.
You're in a position in politics where you have to compromise sometimes.
But everyone has a certain internal limit to when they can't compromise, and that's me.
I didn't want to run for the House of Representatives at first, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorák that I would try to get on the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotkov's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But the Hague wing stopped it.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Slávek Sobotka is a man who always talks about the program of the CPSU and to some extent also about the visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit, I've never heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hashek is just fighting for power.
I don't understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start removing the party chairman.
It's a power struggle against all odds and against the party's rules.
I think what Michal Hašek has done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you feel about the Ostrava leadership not approving you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on competition to get their members to take their place.
The competition should be based largely on programmatic visions and the ability of those people to realize those visions.
Of course, people who do not have much ability or vision enter the contest, but the political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start getting prominent by unscrupulously breaking the rules, breaking the party charter.
They're turning political parties into a mafia by their practices, and I think they're breaking the laws of the Czech Republic.
It's more important to me to draw attention to this problem than to consider whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It's important that the parties start respecting the charter.
So that's why you filed a motion to intervene against the image of the candidate of the ČSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region before the elections?
The current ČSSD district executive committee in Ostrava consolidates its power by abolishing organizations that do not comply with it, purposefully founding new organizations, gradually expelling uncomfortable party members.
For example, they wanted to expel Richard Bednarik from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then cancelled the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that enforcing the party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but once the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The Ostrava leadership of the CSDP led by Adam Rykalo is trying to remove you from the position of mayor.
It's an open secret that the mayor of Porubá, Lumír Palyz, has a big crush on this post.
It's true, Adam Rykkala and the Palisade Lumire are trying to do everything they can to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and with those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
If I go back in time, everything that happened around Minik Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Basel Stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was staged so they could label me as a person who gives money where it doesn't belong.
The city has acquired a property of great strategic value.
So how do you see it going with your tenure as mayor?
The district committee already invited me and others on Monday to consider staying in the CPSU.
But I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch the thief!"
If we look at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and push, sometimes against party members, the creation of so many developmental things, like industrial zones or the expansion of a science and technology park.
Yet everything makes me uncomfortable.
I read it as preventing others from getting to the places they want to go.
Will you still resist these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, political parties must function well.
I find it hard to believe that any party can effectively run a state if it can't run itself.
So I'm not thinking of quitting the CPSU now, because I think the one who's causing the cancer of this party is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc to open public ice skating rink in historic centre
The organizer of Olomouc's Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work on the rink began on October 26 and that the ice-making unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice sheet is now seven centimeters thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The rink is 375 square meters, the stage is 358 square meters.
Two punch booths will also be available for surfers and passersby.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the booths and almost the entire area of the arena is covered so that the skaters can comfortably skate", Burnout described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, a skating rink was installed in front of the main entrance to the town hall on Upper Square for the purpose of repairing Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original position.
The first time people could skate directly in front of City Hall was in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of an elderly man in Zlínsk will be re-examined by the regional court
The district court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the charge.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even a special punishment.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court has overturned the regional court's decision and returned the case to him for further consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons for this decision, stating that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths assaulted a 70-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a painful death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled, beat, and kicked him all over the body, and they also struck him about three dozen times in the head with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol.
The man suffered serious injuries, including a fractured skull, brain swelling, and a brain hemorrhage, which resulted in his death.
The youths reportedly took about $1,000 and jewelry worth about $4,000 from the home.
According to the district court, the only evidence against the defendants was the smell trail, which the expert assessed as not fully detected in accordance with the legal instructions.
Smell marks from the crime scene and other items were consistent with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, but the police initially treated them as physical, not odor, marks.
In addition, some mismanagement was found.
The Senate has determined that the guilt of the accused has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior was found with his head broken off by relatives who thought he may have fallen and injured himself.
Even the paramedic who called in the emergency services didn't report the violent death.
It took several days for the forensic team to be contacted by doctors in Olomouc, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the clues from the crime scene that the relatives had cleared.
No DNA from the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in the Ugerskohradiště.
He is currently serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.
He said the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who were responsible for robbing a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopny.
The younger of the accused in the murder of the senior lives in the Hungarian Fortress.
The court released him in August after 11 months in custody.
Znojmo starts the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojmo will begin.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by a construction crew who will be renovating the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards of the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close out the fall string next week.
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will perform the 18th annual Fall String Festival next Wednesday.
Shorter will perform at the Grand Hall of Lucerne on November 6th with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation by PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangements for symphony orchestra feature the song Pegasus from his novelty album Without A Net, as well as his earlier compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August, Shorter is still full of energy, which is also proven by the fact that the Prague concert at Struny in autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music business over 60 years ago.
The list of performers he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Vienna native Joeh Zawinul, with whom he set the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past thirteen years, he has performed primarily with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
There's a sort of after-party after the festival, and then there's Spotlight night, which is November 9th at the Roxy/NoD Club.
Alongside charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the home crowd will be joined by Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with their jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the dance-inspired electro-jazz outfit Profound Bass.
Damkov says UEFA forbids publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the Czech Football Association's referees' committee, has stopped publishing penalties for referees.
She is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she stated in an interview with the daily Právo.
He said that if he didn't, the FAC would be punished.
Damková also refused to side with the football players of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really nonsense.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the committee are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in case of a vote I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to the criticism that has been stirred up after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although the FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for referees in recent months, Damková assures that judges are being punished for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds that the referee made a mistake, they will limit his delegation, whatever it is in any match", Damková said.
Damko said the reason for not publishing the penalties is the ban from the European Football Union.
'UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes infringement.'
"We're very suspicious and we look for something behind every mistake".
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, tough sanctions will come", Damkov said.
The rest of the countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception", she added.
If the Commission continues to release information, it could lose money from UEFA for referee training and development.
"And they're very important to us".
"Without them, we could not have completed the referee training programme", added Damko.
Bart's arrest is connected to Janusz and Bém.
The Minister of Public Affairs, Vitaly Barta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was arrested along with the head of the anti-corruption police's analytics and computer science department, Jan Petržílek.
The arrest is related to wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janouš and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the senders, which came from the server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
The wiretapped phone calls between Janusz and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which both men refer to each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janusz's influence on the actions of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper reported that they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007 and leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was Bart's at the time.
The server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek was transferred to the anti-corruption unit, which was then dealing with the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"I cannot confirm or say anything at all in the light of the law on the protection of classified information", said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case is not being commented on by the inspectorate for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are making intensive preparations for the coming into force of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only 8% of the companies surveyed said that they had not addressed the issues related to both key codes at all in their company.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed 108 Czech companies.
With the two key codes coming into force, many managers are only now, at the last minute, becoming aware of the significant impact they can have on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and businesses in the Czech Republic.
Because of the politicians' manipulations, the business sector has long been uncertain whether or not revolutionary change will eventually occur.
"But now they have only a few weeks to make the transition to the new law smooth for their companies", commented Jan Zasčil, partner at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies that are actively engaged in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies have already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 per cent of these companies are planning to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recoding, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet addressed the issues related to recoding.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21%) for the largest number of companies surveyed, followed by the settlement of business terms (16%) and changes in the land register and liability for damage (ten per cent each).
The Treaty of Lisbon is the most important new development in the whole process of recodification, unifying the treaty law only in the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will be abolished, which should make contract law more transparent for citizens and businesses.
"For entrepreneurs, the new regulations will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom to arrange relationships", said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal lawyer Lukáš Poddaný.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important issue.
The following topics concern changes in the convening and conduct of the general meeting (15%) and company representation (14%).
The new legislation means stricter obligations and possible consequences for statutory authorities, especially in a situation where a company is facing or entering bankruptcy.
'In practice, this means that if the members of the board and the managers of companies do not act with the care of a good steward and prevent the company from going bankrupt, they can lose the benefits they have gained from their duties only in the last two years,' he added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier's style evolve as a living language
"My job is to preserve tradition while leading our brand to modern things, so as not to become a dusty relic", explains Pierre Rainero, Cartier's head of style, in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house dates back to 1847.
He travels through mud, river and jungle, providing free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
In West African countries, there are not many doctors; only one for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or on your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 contenders for the 2013 CNN Hero Award.
In the 2013 CNN Hero Award competition, you can vote for him or any of the top ten nominees.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious over and over again and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroon capital of Yaoundé in 1981.
At first, he was treated with only a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, where it formed a hematoma that would plague him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy", says Bwelle.
You can leave your house at 5 a.m., rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the United States has one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could visit doctors, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in that country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in that country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty", says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
After seeing his father and many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
And he started a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others stuff their vans, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They're not always happy.
More than once, vehicles have to push through river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle  with her broad smile and unbridled energy  is very willing to join in the local cheer.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each trip", says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, and they walk.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate - a document that the school requires but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
At night, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The surgery is usually done in a school building, a town hall, or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery area to make room for another patient.
Using the light from a generator, an operating room, and hygienic equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
"They play drums all night to keep us up and working", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group  made up of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students  performed 700 free operations last year and is aware that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"It will change the future of our family", said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaoundé.
He says that this latter work finances about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's actually sleeping", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they couldn't get back home.
"We washed Dr. Bwell's hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held his instruments", says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides food, transportation, and education.
"He is without a doubt a hero", says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant downpour is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his Father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain... that's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát has been reappointed as Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic .
The Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 000.
"I think it is essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the Office - a representative they can always turn to if needed", explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think the nursing profession deserves proper attention from the department.
The exercise of this profession requires not only a high level of professional professionalism but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will be happy and responsible to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses".
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare system, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients to perform their profession with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public", says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her appointment that she wants to deal with the various aspects of the nurse's job position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but instead see them side by side, each with their own competence and together with other health professionals, forming a unified team that provides health care for the benefit of the patient".
"I myself face many problems in the nursing profession, and I see these difficulties and want to help solve them".
These include, for example, ensuring that nursing and medical records are simplified.
"I know from personal experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdensome and take up time that nurses could and should be devoting to patients", says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to be addressed include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve team and management cooperation between healthcare providers, regulating competences, and labour law issues such as compliance with the labour code or not burdening nurses with insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous reports, but they are not documented for fear of possible penalties in a specific case where a rule violation may occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of preserving the anonymity of such a complaint and the specific case to be investigated by the competent authorities", concludes Alena Šmídová.
Msgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, she has been working as head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Medical Professions and Recognition of Qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Research.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse in the internal medicine department, and also as a teacher at the Central Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009, she was the chief nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and has lectured in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
♪ So I won't be swallowed by hate ♪
Writer Vaclav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living but not writing, Václav KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
The number of pages is comparable to his most famous work, Houštin (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present time - Emil Hakl - testified for Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - to avoid being consumed by hate.
To see around us ever new clones of that human folly, young organisms afflicted by blind selfish striving.
Not to mention us old people, faces ruined by powerless lust, exasperated souls and otherwise polarized ideologues who try to sell their product with the look of little sales whores.
At the turn of the millennium, I bought a little digital camera and I was filming my law-abiding friends, weirdos and hidden objects.
I'm over it now.
Sometimes I feel like my life on this planet is burning my brain.
My favorite thing is to go for a walk and then read books by the lamp in the evening.
You talk about feeling lost, hatred.
Was there a break in your past that affected you, or are you just getting older like the rest of us?
The break happened a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
But somewhere in there is still a surprised silent boy.
I see other lonely exercise seekers, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I'm going to participate in this huge, thousands of years of movement of the life system on this planet -- the birth of an unfathomable future.
The vast, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir to our present.
We're players in a sad and beautiful game where, through trial and error, we create another and another generation of beings that, in trillions of interactions per second, create some kind of superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, conducted by the right and left hemispheres of the brain, occasionally surfaces and forms into a book.
Just as peaceful times are interspersed with the silent metastases of war, which may one day awaken, so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt a silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do something, it would one day quietly overwhelm me.
It's a set of questions that the brain formulates and then puts them into layers that are stored in the darkness "below the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cortex, is asking for older evolutionary structures, going to the ancient tree-circles of the brain.
He speaks to the furry beasts, he asks the serpents, he searches the birds for answers, he lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
You're relatively often speaking of ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences, and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive process, exposed to a constantly changing presence, in a relentless effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disruptions.
Similarly, if you were to drop your PC, you would be stuck in a speech emulator and a foreign language translator program, first in an operating environment like Windows, and then after a few failed reboots, you would end up with a dark green blinking BIOS screen, the underlying system that controls functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and the RAM, etc.
For those of you who don't understand what I'm talking about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you regularly interested in this particular type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
The functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behaviour are all breaking down.
And I'd like to quote Nietzsche: "He stared into the abyss so long that the abyss stared into him".
It is a sense of loss, of loss, of loss of hope, of psychic death, of a new quality.
And why do I care about that personally?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once one fell into a sink and drowned, and days and months and years passed, and he kept drowning and reading, and these books taught him to swim - to live.
He became a "diver".
I hope a sentence I wrote helps someone, like the words of Hrabal once helped me.
How much do you think about the reader, the specific person who's going to read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, others superego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best described it in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation".
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran through the Shiny Alley in dark alleys.
Still, in the end, behind all the twists and turns of the authors and their message, is this: "The sun shines on other worlds by Karl Hynka Máchy".
What if the book's out?
Do you care what the reader thinks?
The feedback that comes to you through people reading the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take 300 crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, they'll come up to me on the street and thank me for helping them with some of their hard life decisions.
Books are really "lives" or, more accurately, "worlds".
They're encoded in the letters of the characters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of each language.
We can bring them to life anytime if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbiddenly divine -- to awaken more and more life stories, little universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to the old demonology books, we're practicing witchcraft.
After the book is published, you have a series of author reads.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you going to jump back into it with joy, or do you feel differently after all these years?
I'm just telling stories now.
And what did I find out?
There are good, intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic characteristics are that they are discreet, not too conspicuous, have a friendly streak, you don't feel lonely around them.
To give an example, in the town of Red Church there lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly bookstore (his name is aptly Red), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
At one pijat, he introduced me to a chain of readers of my book, The Household.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown a crushed, read copy of my book.
In my embarrassment, I put down my breakfast and cried a little.
We all stood there, silently, shaking and sobbing with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't take it anymore and he jumped out of the window into the snow curtain with a scream.
It was downstairs.
We ran into the night landscape, and slaughtered the happy rage of the sensitive, the pain of the soul of the countryman and the longing of the backward patriots - howling and howling like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and contentally different from the previous ones.
Is that true of the lyrics to "The Wind, the Darkness, the Presence"?
It's a story.
It's a tale of a land beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fairy tale:
There's a dog with a gray chest on it.
The horror, the horror, the mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were devils in hell a long time ago, and we drew lots of lots to see what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let the flow of inspiration flow again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Marchina.
Writing is a wonderful way to have a dialogue.
Something vast and unnameable, like the movement of the continents on the planet, influences our will from such depth and breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so we take for granted exactly what we are programmed to do.
We're rewarded with a surge of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes a malfunction happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot already full of all sorts of malfunctions, standing on the shore of an ocean unconscious, catching the moist wind currents in a hollow canvas made of dirty handkerchief.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama is backing away from health care.
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed off from his oft-repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health care program, you can keep it".
Citing hundreds of thousands of notice letters from providers, Republicans have in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama broke his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have health insurance can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called the "media frenzy" over the testimony, Obama urged Americans who received the announcement to seek new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than previously thought.
"You'll get a better offer", he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change their program because their insurance doesn't meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans straight out: you deserve better", Sebelius said in her testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet marketplace has been a poor one since October.
"I'm as disappointed and angry as everyone else", she said.
I'll try to win back your trust.
An irritated Sebelius delivered this sentence, picked up by a microphone, to a counselor sitting behind her yesterday at a committee meeting that followed a heated exchange with Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should join the Obama care program herself.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly railed against the question of why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance and buy the program through HealthCare.gov that he now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the deal, and according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, it's already in the works.
The transaction should be notified in November, probably before the start of the LTE spectrum auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
The company, Sazka Telecommunications, has launched an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to everyone's surprise, there was no mention of the company's desire to break into telecommunications.
But the Saza is now run by a very experienced telecommunications expert, Robert Chvátal.
He started as head of marketing at Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became director of Slovak T-Mobile and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The Saca is playing several cards at once.
She's signed up for the auction and now she's admitted she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction is successful, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
This would probably not be pleasing to Vodafone under normal circumstances, but according to the Economic Times, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile to share their networks completely.
Vodafone needs a partner like that.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE tender (as a newcomer can bid on a dedicated spectrum), Vodafone may not have to bid at all or it will not mind bidding on a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will connect Sazka to its 2G/3G network (the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), thus enabling the company to get the network up and running quickly.
In the meantime, the company will start building an LTE freight network that will also be available to Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The savings could then be spent by Vodafone on a fixed-line or cable provider.
What about Kellner?
The acquisition of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a subsidiary of the Czech) would immediately give the latter a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big pier waiting to be restructured.
In the auction, the LTE network would have been acquired by Kellner for O2 and most likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already declared that they will share networks.
The auction could thus finally be a success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic will be able to choose between Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Mosquito.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Can Czech TV ever do without a signing event?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it's not hard to hear a complaint that collects evidence of the castle's troupe's troubles.
In the past, the traded influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdick has not been documented in this way, let alone signed.
Right, the management stopped the editors.
The cases described do not, however, answer the question of where this bias of some journalists toward the secularists comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, to avoid vulgarity, a typical expression of inappropriate empathetic hospitality.
And given the general corruption, we cannot help but wonder whether other, equally unscrupulous, powerful interests have not yet had the opportunity to change the situation on television.
It is true that in developed lands there are no botched attempts at political interference.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints about the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Rather, they are critical of what they see as their own tendency, the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we're just not at that stage of civilization yet, and we're not in that situation.
But perhaps in a country that thinks itself the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a murky situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
The curse of this country: presidents on the verge of power.
It is almost a rule that at key moments in the country the head of state was not in a position to fulfill his duties as a statesman.
If T. Masaryk had been five years younger physically and mentally, he would have lived to the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have played out a little differently.
We might not win the war, but after a token resistance, the air force could fly over the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately without having to fight hard for legitimacy.
And most importantly, the surrender would have kept the nation from hanging out to this day.
Benesch was not a statesman and was still in good shape when he was in Munich, but during the war things started to go downhill with him and in February 1948 he behaved accordingly.
If he had been better off, he could have gone into exile a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about the Hawk.
They elected him with the understanding that "Mr. President will not be in a position to make decisions".
But he had to, although the big decision with the knife to Hitler's neck in the chancellery was probably not.
The head of the intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days of March 1939, said that everything should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, did not go so smoothly and with such profit to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, they didn't trust him and they were afraid.
The human wreck of Gottwald had his old comrades executed as Moscow ordered.
Ludwig Svoboda was definitely unable to contribute to normalization and had to be removed, already completely senile.
The fact that the Hook was a helpless and sickly depressed old man made the November '89 events easier, but that's the only good thing.
Havel was lucky to have been spared the worst of the last few years in office.
Klaus may still be a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander in chief of the armed forces is what he is, and we don't know all that yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the Republic from outside.
Or it may be threatening, but it's not visible.
Then the question is, is it exceptionally not good (historically) for the president to be out of power?
It's not a normal condition.
Can't we elect a reasonably sane and reasonably sane man to be president of this country once again?
Distant planets, black and white movies, or a little fantasy about alien life on Earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw around casually.
In the concept of his quartet, which will close this year's Strings of Autumn Festival on November 6 at the Grand Hall of Prague's Lucerne, everything is connected to everything.
The score by jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's quartet is the musicians' current feelings.
His mission is to have two generations younger players perform what they're doing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber work, thinking not of harmony or rhythm but of film images.
But this principle is not one that the recently 80 years old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, nine-time Grammy winner, former Miles Davis bandmate and perhaps the greatest living jazz saxophonist - likes to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my 80s, I've come to believe that the best way to live is to be surprised.
"Too many people plan everything and then get disappointed when things go wrong", says Shorter.
How Insects From Thailand Boosted Sales At A Paris Bar
You may be crawling on an insect, unaware that you are eating about a pound a year of it, completely voluntarily.
Like crushed in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely on the trend: it's organic, it's nutritious, and you've also got a unique experience.
In early October, Elie Daviron, chef and owner of Le Festin Nu, was the first to put insects on the menu at his restaurant in Paris.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th arrondissement, near the tourist-heavy Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger, and quail eggs, guests can taste not only the larvae, grasshoppers, and water bugs but also the squirrels.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that the insects do not damage their wings, legs, or eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu immediately gives several reasons for eating insects.
The first is the environmental benefit, since insect production is much less costly for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water use) than traditional meat.
"Insects are also an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids", Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, but simply sets out to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
He says the right restaurant makes for a pleasant, sinful atmosphere.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just bringing a new experience", he said.
Not everyone would be thrilled to see a beetle devour a pest-free meal, but the reaction of customers at a Parisian bar to the insects served is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics, they say, eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest bites and end up choosing a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Czech Union of Construction Entrepreneurs Václav Matyáš: The new green economy should continue
The Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts since 2008 and the State's lack of interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for SMEs in the regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who will save considerable sums on heating once the measures are implemented, but also for construction companies and building materials manufacturers.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the State's fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, and it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the Government's resolution and calls for the implementation of such steps as would allow for further continuation of the programme so that further calls can be announced under it.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
The dog rolled up the carpet, the president tripped, and ended up on the stretcher.
President Milos Zeman left the Prague Motel Hospital on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lany.
What's his condition?
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far".
John Kerry has hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented admission, he said that in some cases, espionage "has gone too far".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting on autopilot in the wake of the troubling revelations about NSA spying that came out of Edward Snowden's whistleblower.
The release of the information has sparked a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry said via video link at an open government conference in London: "There is no doubt that the president and I and others in government have actually learned about some of the things that were happening out of inertia, because there was that possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then of course September 11".
He became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that it had not violated anyone's rights.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far".
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you, there is no violation of the rights of innocent people in this trial.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA organization was for the greater good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up".
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow up people and attack governments.
What if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from blowing up, people from being executed, because we already know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are preparing to travel to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged U.S. espionage and to convince Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because they were disappointed with the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
It is indeed important for US national security interests that Europe stays on board with us in our joint efforts to fight terrorism, said Murphy, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some of America's allies, although the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States,
Another revelation cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had been monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and as many as 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended Allied espionage as necessary, saying it was a common practice on both sides.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip to be held this year and hopes to have members of both parties and the House on the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other lawmakers who intend to get involved will be announced.
He said the program was still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help repair the relationship, he added that "well-meaning educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realise that we are not the only ones doing the spying here", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is on his way to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility generated by U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island after falsely claiming that she was attacked by a taxi driver appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 in a land court on Phuket Island with perjury after Thai police said a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a recording from industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket Island police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted to making up the story.
She was held in a local police cell before her trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunkes, who sought help from the Foreign Office in Canberra in his daughter's case.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously, it's a difficult time, but we hope he comes back safely as soon as possible", said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
Reports from Australia say that she had meanwhile been on holiday in the Krabi recreation area of southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in adult prison.
But after the recent murder of Australian tourist Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to repair the tourist stigma that may have been behind the acquittal.
Jagr joked, "A goal from a bracket?"
He got a puck in the end zone and no one caught him again.
Plus, the escape turned into a fast forehand call.
Jaromír Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night, the 119th NHL winning goal was posted on Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobod was contacted by the director of Czech Railways and asked if I would be interested in doing an advertisement for their most modern Pendolino train!" wrote Jagr in the introduction.
He says we're kind of a lot alike.
I guess I'll have to stop night training to keep it from accelerating.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might call and want to advertise jets!" he added with a smile.
New Jersey also claimed their second straight victory.
"And most importantly, you noticed - Maria Rottr's treatment is working", concluded Jagr.
Instead of the candlelight post-election goulash
The October election brought a lot of losers rather than winners.
These are not only parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of their internal division.
The politicians served us post-election goulash instead of Christmas candles.
The election was sparked by the Andrei Babis movement, which promised voters to change the political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party is being recorded by the political (d) will of President Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even vote for the party that President Zeman publicly supported in the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians because of the unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to regain it - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the CPSU is getting closer to becoming prime minister, the businessman Andrei Babis is getting closer.
Although the electoral development is still miles away from a quick and smooth formation of a stable government, compared to the election scenario of the left-wing Communist-backed ČSSD government, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore for the economy.
Due to the loud opposition of the ANO to merge with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite depressing for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD composed of "non-Zemanovci" in the Castle will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD participates will be threatened by the unfulfilled ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further division in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to automatically get another early election?"
The next election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the YES vote.
Plans by the CPSU to introduce sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the building of a state bank have hopefully fallen by the wayside.
The parties ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit, on the other hand, agree on, for example, business support, a moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support for employment of disadvantaged people, a reduction in the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The three areas are most common in terms of social policy and state size.
But the YES is now in the lead, so the program of the most likely coalition of YES, CPSU, KDU-CPSU would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better outcome than a leftist tax program on everything else in the economy.
