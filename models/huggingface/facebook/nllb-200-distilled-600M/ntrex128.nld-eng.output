Members of the National Assembly for Wales worried they'd be compared to Muppets
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly for Wales over a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is the result of the plans to change the current name of the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly from various political parties are concerned that the new name will be ridiculed.
A member of the National Assembly for Wales from the Labour Party said MWP is on the brink of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for shit.
A member of the National Assembly for Wales from the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly for Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to implement the name change, said: It is the members of the National Assembly for Wales themselves who will of course make the final decision on their new title.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly for Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was the most supported in public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty in reaching consensus, and she must submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their new title once they debate legislation.
Macedonian citizens vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a contentious dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province of its own called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are silent, those of Harlem have a hard time
"The older people I spoke with said that there used to be a café and a church on every corner here", Mr Adams said.
Today, there is no café or church here.
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
People now have a different way of social contact, he said.
Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people visit regularly.
He is concerned, however, that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will last less than the leaders expected, and sooner or later they will return to the beginning.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won't help in the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white, he says,which will lead to these churches closing even faster, because it is unlikely that people who move into these flats will join the church community.
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original white Methodist church left in the 1930's.
A black church congregation from the area took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could seldom get a job or get promoted.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the beard in July referred to the instrument in another way: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first ever beard played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beard of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the parish's governing body, composed of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express concern that the diocese would want to pass the costs on to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-old scuba diver in California
On Saturday, the first day of the raccoon season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was racing for raccoons in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had spent about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
His clavicle was completely open, and Hammel saw him approach the boy.
I shouted everyone out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It's not clear which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach patrol captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted nearby, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the upper body.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is trying to break into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and is setting up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to capture the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods continue to fall. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If successful, they will be introduced in more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of supermarkets wanting to replenish the shelves where TVs, microphones and interior goods used to be.
Sainsbury's is looking to double its beauty offerings and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space, with exhibition space per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first having opened in Croydon, south London, the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets have to make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on discount stores Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago, which the company says has increased food sales and increased returns on the acquisitions.
Last time the supermarket tried to make a makeover of its Beauty and Pharmacy departments, it was a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a dispute arose over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy stores three years ago for a sum of £125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've completely changed the layout of our beauty department to make it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our staff, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer what everyone wants, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop the old fashioned way.
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "angry" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle company.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
The Jones and Willoughby company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because she recently pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when Willoughby announced at a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new contracts (worth up to £1.5 million) did not allow enough time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said that "Truly" was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would secure her long-term future, and produce enough for the next few decades.
Everyone was amazed when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe their ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the head office in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be delayed further.
And that could mean the end of a friendship that's lasted years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S' brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source in Jones' entourage said last night: "We have no comment on his business affairs".
♪ Hard language ♪ And then love was between us ♪
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find inappropriate for a president, and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
I didn't give up anything.
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting, and Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear dismantling.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea sees no "compliant response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament initiatives.
The United States is in the process of imposing sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea", he said.
We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: missile tests have been completed, hostages have been released, and the material surplus of U.S. military personnel has returned to their home country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
"In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they are not seeking international assistance, which is difficult for us", said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working on a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the aid workers from abroad will be able to work on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to protect against tsunamis, but on other coasts, you rarely see them.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was in effect, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under ideal conditions, traveling from one Indonesian island to another can be difficult.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was being built in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the disaster site.
Improving Indonesia's harborless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is struggling with a lack of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority now follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes as Christian and Islamic gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is making an impressive tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool last Saturday from a Premier League loss to Chelsea, scoring a goal in the 89th minute, in a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left to the ball and then kicked towards the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the upper right corner of the net.
He escaped the leap from Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and I dared to try.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead at rest, after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' top kicked the ball with his heel at Mateo Kovacic, then rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's play-half.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet in the middle.
Then he gave a nice kick, which allowed Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool will play at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play at 3pm on Thursday in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed as a result of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake last Friday, which also produced waves of 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is filled with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street with a body showing stab wounds.
Police are asking local residents to report if they see or hear anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact me if they have any chance of capturing anything via a dash cam, because they can have information that is essential to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
She keeps saying, "How bad!
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the depot and a third was just outside.
Inside the depot, several officers were keeping an eye on the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, with log 247 dated September 30.
Statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewrite history' riot
The banishment of the statue would be poetic justification for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "a foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the discovery of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the 19th-century opinion and is part of the historical record of a figure that many still believe to be in demand today.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today, to be the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct representation is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.
Murder-loving pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local media reports said.
The man, whose only last name is Yuan, was found dead at a stall in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, with a perforated artery and blood under him, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pigsty on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his nephew from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and a door to a neighboring pigsty was opened.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pigsty.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruises", said the cousin, whose last name is Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his nephew's.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare, but there have been instances of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
They're just games.
They're like children, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa is bringing heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and southwestern Mexico in the coming days.
With winds of 135 km/h (135 mph), Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time on Sunday morning and was located 620 km (620 miles) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching dew will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Local 2 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to rainfall of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some 5 to 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions is possible, as tropical rainfall can be very widespread.
It is strongly advised to walk into the desert when the tropical rain is threatened.
Heavy rainfall can turn ravines into raging rivers, and storm surge will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching drought is bringing some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California locally.
There's a 1.5 cm rainfall potential, which could lead to small debris streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
Spread tropical rainfall will approach Arizona Sunday night until Monday morning, after which rainfall will spread more on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the United States may fluctuate significantly as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large temperature differences over short distances.
There's a good example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continued summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast, anywhere around 30°C.
In New York, it could be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States is high until mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on Thursday for the eye-catching testimony of U.S. Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent sure a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a spirited testimony that he was 100 percent sure this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet received any information on the situation of the Union industry in the Union.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
By comparison, that's about like a football game play-off or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's appointment, had the most viewers on the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's events.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN and CBS cameras recorded Friday morning that protesters were yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He stood up for a few minutes with his eyes down while he was being mocked, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, "You have power, whereas so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various stations broadcasted it live when the Judiciary Committee had to vote hours later on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor of the nomination on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats of the minority are insisting.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, a senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes they needed to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of playing a political game with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that her proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's taxes was absurd.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is serving time in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
Police questioned Simpson and later stated that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their commitment and commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 5'8" and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in shock" because of Waydes' death.
"This is an event you always hope will never happen", says Wade.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
The ash that is being ejected by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected multiple rumblings and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car roads in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists were defeated by riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by riot police beat the officers with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled up their fists to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, don't forgive' while their opponents chanted 'Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the region, which is seeking independence, a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent, although turnout was low and those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the regional polling stations, leading to violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the site on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Although the pro-independence Catalan parties won a decisive victory in the regional elections in December, even if they were short-lived, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, as many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity awaiting trial over their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
Tensions are rising, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,he said.
London: men arrested after house-raiding
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly raided in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It's possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them the win.
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a streak of 18 games since he became manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came in at the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win a Premier League game this season, and they must take the lead on Sunday against leader Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston has been undefeated, and the team has won six straight games in his division, and coach Holt hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team could have taken a lead long before the first goal, because their direct play caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great fun, waiting for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston made an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
By that time, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for quite some time, but the home team's defense was unbreakable and goalie Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against Rangers goalie Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a push from his fellow Livingston players.
Continuing to advance, the assailants reached Livingston's penitentiary, but were repulsed each time, and a penalty was denied twice, one after Halket attacked assailant Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played exceptionally well and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and team composition have barely changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt in particular deserves much recognition for the way he has been playing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall running on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, could not break through.
Although they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they failed to reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to beat the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize they need to play better, as they are somewhere in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany shared breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police, citing security concerns, ordered the crowd of 25,000 people to gather outside the mosque, but many sympathizers came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and will notify his immediate family.
The road is blocked in various places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured in disorderly conduct
Six guards were injured in a disorderly disorder at a heavily-secured prison for men, according to the Bureau of Prisons.
The riots broke out at around 9.30am local time on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialised torpedo boaters have been deployed to solve a situation involving eight captives in one unit.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Special training prison staff were deployed for a recent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to prison for a serious disorderly conduct that involved staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (possibly with positive effects on drought areas)
It's rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert, which carries flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be hanging just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's going to rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 3 to 5 inches of rain, and here and there is a 10 inches chance.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
While flooding is very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map that identifies current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
The path of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 140 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens it.
So it's expected to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall may fall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
Falling from 8 to 15 cm from Baja California to northwest Sonora is expected, with up to 25 cm of rainfall possible, reported weather.com.
Rosa moves northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona and southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest of the desert area", the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found injured at approximately 4 a.m. local time on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything of what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered under the brutality, the rage" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his nomination process, Kavanaugh has continually "suffered under the common cold, the rage" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the wonderful and incredible character, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to recognize one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record of service", he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican run in the midterm elections.
In five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part, he said.
That's why I'm all over the place for great candidates.
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, with many wiped out by huge waves hitting the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the land at the time of the twilight, many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still on the beach, but they did not immediately leave and were the victims of the tsunami", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Natural Disaster Relief Agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land", said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had travelled at 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climb a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Relief Agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to shake with aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further exacerbated the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "substantial" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, with some 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala is completely flat, we have no information at all, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy now, but it could get much worse", the Red Cross said.
The organization was widely criticized on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media has been heard of a man on the top floor of a building screaming in panic at people down the street to warn them of an impending tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, sweeping buildings and cars away.
Reuters couldn't verify the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only reopened for aid purposes and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are seeking shelter in covering tents, they have passed through scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid groups began to carry out the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, foreign funding, goods and personnel may only be allowed if the site of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, O.K., this is a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami struck Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would regain their loved ones' lives, as in the miracles that people so much love to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
A little boy was pulled from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, aid workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr Gendon said that news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours afterward he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one grey dot instead of two blue ones appeared in his messages.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While he was working, another man ran after Brink's employee and stole a bag of money ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee, the press release said, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: "The being formally known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West, who has been known as Ye for a while, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for "emotional reasons", the show's creator says.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously told me that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means jij, West said earlier this year, when he was talking about the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, we are it.
I've moved from Kanye, which means "the only one", to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's not the only famous rapper changing his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the coupling and capital letters.
Mexican president promises not to use force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, and the country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that youths often join criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on AI research, says investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about AI coming from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China announced last year its plan to become the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI, Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood that the next big achievement for AI will take place in the United States, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat American Othello's best player, and later served as manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do,  Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting the best of the best from universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee said U.S. AI efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
Whoever is getting a doctorate in AI would automatically have to be offered a green card, he said.
The Chinese National Council published its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides financial support to academic staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center designed to engage partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in research into AI.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the creation of a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been in the works for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change in their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece and would no longer impede Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor implies that the country claims Greek territory.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign would not ensure that the required turnout of at least 50 percent would be achieved, thus potentially invalidating the referendum.
The question on the ballot is as follows: Are you in favour of NATO membership and EU acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Advocates of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent at the time, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
"I am here to vote because it is important for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and put chairs in front of tents that were placed by people boycotting the referendum.
We support NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a backdoor, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of those would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes Brighton's full defence and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling finished the game with a 2-0 victory over Manchester City in the Etihad Stadium in Brighton.
It was like a whistle of a penny, Aguero scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spiker got the ball first in the middle of the field.
He raced through three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he gave me a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has foot problems", Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first lead in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful stake pass down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just hit the ball, just before he was too far.
City will play Hoffenheim at 12.55pm on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage, taking place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play and make it hard for the Rockies to make the playoffs .
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force a fresh start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are any consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoffs.
The Rockies have at least earned a wild card to the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win over the Nationals last Friday, but they're now willing to do everything they can to secure their first division title.
While there's nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with this audience will be optimal and the other team will probably play at the highest level I'd be facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on the move on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to put Scherzer on the pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the infield Thursday and would pitch the following Sunday, although that is his normal rest day.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, while discussing the importance of the Republican run-up to the midterm elections.
Everything we've achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't participate, but I do, so I'm going out for great candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump went on: "We're seeing a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power no matter what they have to do to do it.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
And we've seen that for the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats mean and mean and false and lying.
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to loud public outcry.
Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MPs who got us not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar issues like these, in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday nights during the eight years I have been a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a more gentle, more gentle policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever been started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political outlook to me, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position I would never have agreed to otherwise, from topics such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak for an audience, whatever I say, there are outrages on social media calling for my candidacy for MP at the next election, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a Labour member.
And that's all I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious atrocities are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules the party becomes smaller.
I have been advised many times over the past two years not to speak out loud and not get into trouble.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both as a councillor and as a minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy views and my differences with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country is dragging itself towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have actually only one message, and that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy for MP in the next election or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in the way that I think is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on their way to the top
Two late tries may have slightly skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightfully triumphing in this glorious match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of the top 10.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that brought the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie was satisfied.
"We've had a tough time in our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I'm a happy man", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: "All credit to Ayr, they've taken their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advantage for Ayr, but a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' game) allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo made a penalty kick for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the break, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
The match was held for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a bench, and once the match was restarted Ayr could continue through a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed a try from Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a touchdown to the penalty line-out behind the upcoming Ayr moul.
Climo made the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran is leaving Still Game for the restaurant, apparently being appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old stars as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself stars alongside his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it appears Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was looking for a way to join the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Seamen patrolling a rigged naval office in La Paz.
A blue flag is waving on public buildings.
At all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is ours".
It's a duty to win them back.
Throughout the land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to surrender to Chile after a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should be delivered on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the outcome with positive prospects, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the Court's ruling on the big screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of bitter talks, is obliged to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
The decision on Monday is also at stake for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he swore in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the last four years may have even worsened.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,Zárate said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric has all the goodwill that Chile may have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue after this.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political tool.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific, he added.
The ruling is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot be trusted.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit between the leaders of rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming the stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "utopia" that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is unlikely to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps first in disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when it says it would abandon an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your sight, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a notable move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to be missed from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking feature of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, hanging over the models' eyes.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons filled with gems, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn tight, more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by "La Bomba", the two-meter-wide, straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that popped up all over social media also led to another big creation on the catwalk: a beach bag that was almost as big as the model swimsuit that carried the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and finished with a white leather stallion, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, and given the huge impact the designer has made, it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra-large accessories".
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and further individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates among independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages scored high.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools shows that 72 percent of students scored high (A) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students scored high in German, 69 percent of students in French and 63 percent of students in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as a subject as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 percent of the barriers to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive edge.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
This is why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools choose the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the future.
It is not currently denied that languages remain vital for the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut Sunday with the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in the preseason opener game Sunday in San Diego.
It's still a matter of deciding how many minutes he'll play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule for the six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself", he said.
Period of Trump's election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a long series of election rallies
It's the first of five planned rallies by Trump in the coming week, including stops in places he loves, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nomination of the candidate he chooses for the Supreme Court vacancy has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia start tonight, and how are you watching online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely be talking about the hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have been added to as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republican candidates for the November election gain momentum.
President Trump's campaign leadership said the five rallies next week are meant to stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House, Reuters reported.
Control of Congress is so important to his program, that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins, a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday marks the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is running out of votes.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the lead up to Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of opportunity is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
"They had a six-point lead at first, and now it's only four more, so we kind of feel like luck is on our side right now", Jordan Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points ahead, while there are 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a formidable opponent of tea to green, and he sets a good example.
The typical throat noises he makes when he plays well, became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pitch that made Game Four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His pitch that won the game at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind you can infer from which he believes the American team is not yet defeated.
"You have to dig deep and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but wonderful European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
Moliwood was the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the back nine on Friday mornings they avoid bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audiences, they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and if Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to score a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
It is premature, however, to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were short-lived with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a draw for the Spaniard and the Swede who could not beat them.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duo, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has played well so far and has a good lead in the lead up to the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is starting with a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, and after Saturday's four-ball and foursomes, they're 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, giving them a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is keen to win back the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blurring Americans in the morning's four-ball game, with a score of 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, are just the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After they had tied Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they had played each other beautifully and beat a disappointing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed a brilliant run occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three, with 2&1.
Yet Europe was not at a leisurely pace on this pleasant day of a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the American record by three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has managed to catch a four-point lead at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has enough draw as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to have taken a turn for the worse.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would under no circumstances be able to unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing site and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
We do not see a similar response from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded as it moves forward, it was noted that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first ever summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
The US is pushing for denuclearization first and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the declaration of an end to war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an aircastle of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only reinforce our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader suggested earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: If the other party on this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.
Yet Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be targeted on the US mainland after Mr. Evil President Trump named a missile man Kim on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and firmly until we have achieved complete, final, verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has, since 2006, adopted unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to make preparations for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making "cruel demands".
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is making sure all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture where it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which, as far as he knows, is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after he gave a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why don't I hear this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organised for the first time this year, will explain to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see an image of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, and the importance of a routine sleeping.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know all this, just as people have a right to know what health consequences their choice of cigarettes has, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in one night's study still exists, he says, and with modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, high-quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped to design the course for Professor Czeisler, who had been a student of the professor's last year when he was a freshman at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar curriculum before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm before bedtime, not just an alarm to get up, but also to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light from electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, causing you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal of Menga makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers saw their game go on disappointingly again when Dolly Menga scored and beat Steven Gerrard's weak team 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's side hoped for their first outdoor win since defeating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's side narrowly missed out on the win, barely second to Gerrard as manager in 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes into the break, and the Rangers failed to tie the game.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third, with only a difference in goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get into more trouble, as Border Judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the visitors' team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, they beat Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed on the same team for Livingston, who had a point on the Hearts last week, and he would have been thrilled with the way his well-trained team was able to block the opponents every move.
The Rangers may have had the most balls, but Livingston had more.
They should have scored after two minutes when Menga gave up the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep freeway from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked the back pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it when they could get closer to the goal.
Alfredo Morelos, at least, felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of an hour, but referee Steven Thomson withdrew the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice into the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was previously the goalkeeper at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Livingston's opener in the 34th minute should not be in the extension of the overall game course, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not up to the depths of Jacobs' game.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball into the goal.
Gerrard caused a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch, which had almost immediate consequences as the winger passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stage of the race, but McGregor held out well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Rangers offensive lineman Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty kick after a collision with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson turned his attention to the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from the calendar of our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today, for whom it's fair to say... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the geiger meter.
The guitar player has since become a force to be reckoned with in science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in Bells or Coronado, a 1950 film featuring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: That's a geiger meter that's used to track down radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: It's really going off now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
Vaccin teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient to alter them in a laboratory.
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject it.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, then the cells in the lab are modified to see the protein HER2, which is common in all types of cancer.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2  stimulates the growth of various types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and training these cells to target cancer cells has been shown to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West is taking off pro-Trump tirade and wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was announced during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after a disagreeable performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, with a hat on his head that said "Make America Great Again", he staged a tirade against the Democrats, repeating his support for Trump.
 Often when I talk to a white person, they ask, How can you sympathize with Trump now? He's a racist!
If I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago, he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford is accusing him of.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to use his mail to pin the dragon on West.
West also complained to the audience that he was shot backstage for his hat.
They've been treating me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on stage with that hat".
They've been treating me!
And then they say I'm apathetic, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how apathetic she looks?" He said he'd wear her Superman-cap, "because that means you can't tell me.
Give me some love.
At least twice, the audience shouted, and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety.
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a rendition of the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of our bravest minds,
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "just himself", and that's wonderful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone who harms, supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too, she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collaborating rapper Snoop Dogg has also been known as Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast police court on Monday.
The prosecution will investigate the allegation.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is reaching out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor echoes the stereotype of male protagonists, saying that when young boys see such roles on screen, they often think they need to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks something has gone wrong and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where has our masculinity gone wrong?' he said.
'What did we teach men growing up that now brings us to this problem?'
Kit thinks television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to his very masculine characters.
He continued: "What was born and what was learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes young boys think they should be some kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be acting in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
Starting November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so that's how I've kept my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a major problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been outlawed in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the land, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in the sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medicines since 2003 as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member leaked data from Republican senators and cites "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters is speaking out against allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations are being spread by far-right media and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vicious lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The data published would include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The data was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct addressed to Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak came after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie", Waters said.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry", wrote Fleischer.
From this, you can tell she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He must not become a rebel.
He shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being overly angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Seventy, if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified, she said,and that they are held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again - a weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new British-influenced film, we're now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that's certainly proven to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comedy action films starring a sloppy spy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satire about how bad we're doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyeballs and his flexible facial features at least manages to make everything go away, even with his second comeback, and you can tell from his name that he is a general comic character designed for movie goers in countries where people speak a language other than English.
He's obviously the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a little bit of that guy who contributed a note to the theme song for Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV series (which everyone has forgotten by now) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains a couple of beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blade ticked against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much physical comedy he has, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough exaggerated, especially now that the serious 007 and Mission Impossible movies themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do it well.
The humor seems to be more for children than adults, and the crazy disaster of Johnny English seems to me to be less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is that Britain is now in great trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the top-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identities of all active British secret agents, much to the dismay of the officer in charge, unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that's making the Prime Minister's bucket overflow, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as a politician.
According to her intelligence advisers, she should deploy a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a fancy institution, but teaches informal undercover work.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former pathetic assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is a submarine captain, a volatile and joyous role that is below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service's disastrous conditions are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, unfortunately, the prime minister falls for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of creepy crazy fun: dressed as obbers, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they kick noise aboard the luxury yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
For the latter, all records are opened, but as well-intentioned and tumultuous as the scene is, it reminds me of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And like the other Johnny English films, I wonder, can the British film industry really not come up with a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies the party is devising a plan whereby Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan where British people work four days a week but get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants business owners to pass on the savings they make from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
This way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend and still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea is in the party's economic agenda and the plans to shift the balance of the country towards the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek has already been approved by the Federation of Trade Unions, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen at any one time, but a four-day workweek is an objective which is within the Party's aim to increase the balance of the economy to the benefit of the workers and which is also within the Party's overall industrial strategy.'
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party had already promised a four-day workweek in the 2017 national election campaign.
The aim is not yet supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a policy decision of the party and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make clear his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "faceless executives" and "profiteurs" of utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not get the full value of their stake back because a Labour government could apply 'cutbacks' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there were plans to include employees on the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would give 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees earning up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview that airs on Sunday on 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that might lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told you before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be stuck.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite", he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival is being held in New York, an annual music event that will feature a very impressive lineup of stars with an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concertgoers wishing to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, holding a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully raising awareness for the goal: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action or is it just another form of "clicktivism", making people feel like they're making a real contribution by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million supporters' actions have been registered, targeting a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have helped global leaders to make efforts and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that will change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised through sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and executives aimed at 'helping children reach their full potential', which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice that is malnutrition", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told audiences at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after sending more than 5,000 actions asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced that it would support a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website, which asked "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group said, "It's going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing this year at the event in New York City hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to block Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to stop this.
"The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to keep the shipping lanes open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that they were not substantially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a country with only a 'small art' with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trum of Berlin says has made Moscow a "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion and doubling the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers", Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has prompted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industry organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday she was "seriously considering" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to rebuild the corrupt government, and this includes a woman in the top position", she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was "directing this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is bringing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this".
However, a poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren's own supporters believe she should not run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were for her to run.
The poll showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a potential run for president in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD from Track Palin during an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
"By what my own son has to go through, what he is going through now that he's back, I have understanding for other families who are suffering the effects of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning to", she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and they've become harder, they come back and they wonder if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given for the fatherland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assaulting a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington, D.C., filed a statement last Friday in the Washington courthouse as a "friend of the court" in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent gang-related sons" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas after that.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people seek asylum in the United States come, as countries with major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
'Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle,' the friend of the court stated.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants entry to the United States is damaging to the US economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and 'provide the country with the necessary labour force'.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if they are serious, that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
The situation for the survivors also got worse.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her fever-ridden baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched their wet possessions for valuable items they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the possibility of severe re-shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he shared his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall", Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper, praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that is denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked, according to US officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasing import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now doubling the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is using freedom of speech and the free press, a long-standing American tradition by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find in vain at a kiosk in central Beijing different voices and you will not see a true reflection of the varied opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article", as if he did not say which newspaper it was.
The Kavanaugh debacle has alienated Republican women voters just before midterm elections, analysts warn.
Now that many prominent Republicans are rallying around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, defending him against various sexual assault allegations, analysts are warning that this will set them back, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue have gone up tremendously and most Republicans have already expressed their desire to continue the vote.
"These things cannot be turned back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake's (Republican, Arizona) last-minute bid for an FBI investigation would be enough to satisfy angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they don't forget tomorrow, and they don't forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach record highs", Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and it's true.
But it can go further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans pressed the nomination.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh's place on the court, but it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, explains to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be divided over who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony and 35 percent definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was certain or likely to have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the tech legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "world domination" is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
It can store contact lists, activity lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not be having conversations with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will completely change all their business models at once".
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and recipient of the Victoria Cross from WWI
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is honored 100 years later in his native town.
Lieutenant Colonel, the Honorable Bernard Vann was awarded the award following the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and thus never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather had been honored.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field artillery and machine guns".
He later stormed on to the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and disabling three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "were something I know I can never touch, but also something that made me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a stuffed Bellator 206 and you're missing the most important moment.
The San Jose billboard listed 13 fights, including six in the main section, and was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were unexpectedly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had stayed up all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"Government regulations say that after 6:00 a.m., no content that is not suitable for children can be shown, so we had to switch to the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep the pig, yess".
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they're going to change their programming to ensure viewers in the UK get a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the re-match, we can solve this problem", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and believe me, not all of them were as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We're limiting the broadcast to five nights instead of six, as we normally would, trying to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic sprinter Tom Daley says that he felt inferior in his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to further education, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me.'
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that parenting had contributed to his underestimating of winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a hook on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that he felt "less" than others when he was young because "it was socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys".
He said: "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful".
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that he would not disappoint people if they eventually found out what he was.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community, using his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "completely surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to endure so much at such a young age", he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have said it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father hadn't accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already gotten the tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breath actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd dreamed of this all my life. Diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics is the best feeling I've ever had", he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, which had grabbed him hard on the way to the games and which still gave him a bad skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the couch during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must see his form recovered to make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is entering his 12th two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the five-time major winner splits his day between supporting his teammates and practicing at the driving range, trying to figure out what's wrong.
Since he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass routinely punishes the roughs' wandering balls.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will come in at the ninth match on Sunday against the always-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single games start well, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Fury has shown confidence in this man, although frankly he could hardly do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, wrapped his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play just two games.
I expected more, but it is what it is, and it is the way we thought we should act.
He wants to be there, like everyone else".
Mickelson could improve Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws to his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain untouchable impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's got a grip, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed playing him occasionally last week, which was funny to watch.
He has so much more to offer than just his game".
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that a big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
De Deen made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually crossed the finish line by the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now", said Bjorn, pictured here, after seeing the 2018 edition win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, giving a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get to work and execute the plan properly.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and that's what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players we can have, but we're also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world".
Excited at the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance in this field.
Tomorrow is another challenge.
Tomorrow we will be discussing individual performance, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there running with a partner when it's going well, but when you're on your own, your golf skills aren't really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he needs to get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience on both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of that speech", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had cheered his players up for the final day.
"We have 12 big games ahead of us tomorrow, but let's try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we get the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We've aligned our lineup on this and we're sending the men on the road in the order we think is best and, you know, we're going to try and pull something out of the hat tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the batting order.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we're so constantly covered", Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
The new German warship has been postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have entered service in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but it will take at least another year to be ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the lead ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and anti-ship missiles, and some kind of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years in a row, far from home ports.
The continuing delays mean, however, that the advanced warships, designed to enable Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware flaws' that would render the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was seriously overweight, which would reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, twice the size of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are becoming more important because of recent warnings that the German navy is declining in power.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the navy actually "lacks deployable ships".
The official said that over time the problem has grown like a snowball, because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were yet available for enlistment in the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study on a farm in the Scottish Highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf mouse, the brown giant caterpillar mouse and the water caterpillar at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the bat's activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile tests using handheld sensors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind of action it is.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS's conservation adviser, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating pastures and how best to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use advanced echo-location techniques to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out inspections, inspections of beds and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
Landscape administrator David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a great bat environment", he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is still so much not known about bats, and therefore the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
It stresses the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unintentional destruction of a nesting site could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially wiping out a whole local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of our species are doing with their populations".
Ronaldo denies assault charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described allegations of assault as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to press charges against the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus star is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news" hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they're saying today, fake news", says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal. I'm not going to lie.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and by and by good", the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit to prosecute Der Spiegel for allegations they called "an unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount that matches the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as indicted in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent", but that he is sometimes left out for that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms the couple had sex, but that it was a mutual favor.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of the consequences" and worried about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants the arrangement to be declared void because she's been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' leaving carmakers
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in auto production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'concerned' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a "no-deal Brexit" would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their concerns about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most carmakers are concerned about the risks in the supply chain in the event of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'just-in-time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border unrest could break out, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota was informed that it could not store more than one day's supply at the factory in Derbyshire and therefore production would be stopped in that case.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is "exactly aligned to avoid those border checks".
"We need to have a deal, we want the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity", he told listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with these very successful supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is the Unite union representative at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, says White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been stirring Washington's rumor machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to impeach the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't like" firing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press officer, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'd always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters have had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attracting" TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to get attention".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, without providing any evidence. "We looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that a lot in the past few weeks, and that's going to take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with the president alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made an open-minded and at times bizarre appearance for the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working at NHS Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and wish that they continue to work at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared its willingness to bear the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
However, at the same time, the UK Government has also tightened its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
I therefore wish to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and that provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach at Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident happened shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline and dropped down there more or less", Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately put Abercrombie on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/scale of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He was re-signed five times before leaving the field on Saturday, giving him a total of 18 rebounds this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rates when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless under new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in wages is charged to non-taxable persons in the UK
The Treasury expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who is attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to tell this story to high earners.
The increase in wages is charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional proceeds being used in an effort by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is above the current levels, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rent, may be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by people outside the UK, which pushes up prices and makes it difficult for beginners to get a foot in the door.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially the capital, have become virtually 'ghost towns' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the levy to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it and called on May to cancel quotas on affordable housing to repair the "housing shame" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent caps and an end to eviction 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the 'British Dream', that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means our faulty housing market needs to be fixed.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for non-UK residents and for foreign companies to buy homes here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a home has become a vague dream, and the humiliation of living without a roof over their heads is already too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to ever become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast English club, which is currently third in League One, on three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a football player, I always wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B team and that was the end of the game", Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I saw my father and I play Scotland a lot at Hampden Park, and it's something that keeps drawing me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club".
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a major club, having previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League", he says.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there".
Ross has only been working on his managerial career for three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he ever was in his football career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads", he recalled the moment he took over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did my best, I earned pretty good money, and I've had some pretty good highlights.
But football can be hard.
There are a lot of things you're facing every week.
I still do, given the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm a manager, I feel better than I've ever felt in my adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of UK pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cups meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when pubs had 2.8 percent more sales, with the difference that restaurants were now getting even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that focused on selling liquor performed far better, with better like-for-like growth than restaurants that were down.
Pubs that also focus on selling food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurants.
It seems that people only go out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, sales of beverages were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower".
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main drivers of turnover in the leisure market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused operators, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures of August can provide much needed respite".
Total sales growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion.

Twenty percent of the students say they have a "main account" that they show their parents too
One in five children, some no older than 11, makes social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in 'fake Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean "main account" to show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who was asking others to "rape" her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools' Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to following personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they're not found by their parents and teachers".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' at the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete on the track and field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport's executives to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election to the council", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help govern the sport in Scotland".
The American who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four Olympic gold medals, and now a regular commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after a TIA.
He tweeted: "Today, a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been a terrible amount of hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and I am doing my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the supporting testimony!"
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows online
A breast pump company has shared the opinion online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what has been called "the world's quietest portable breast pump", consumer technology producer Elvie released an ironic music video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump offers to stuttering mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a grass-filled barn to a song that includes lyrics like, 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't notice, these aren't onions, these are my breasts.'
The chorus then continues with, "Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, immediately sparked an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, mostly mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it condones the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within days of delivery", the response reads.
The Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into a feeding tube (Elvie/Mother).
Another observed: "This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't looked too hard.
This is a brilliant product", wrote someone.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at moms who pump (often in the workplace or toilet) and then feel like 'cows.'
This advertisement does not express itself positively or negatively about the dairy industry at all.'
At the end of the video, you see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who plow sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a feeding tube, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they're cuddling.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between cuddling mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the cuddling and the challenges involved in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rigid rhetoric and rigid policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to get children to sponsor.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and they fear risking their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
We are prosecuting these individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of the children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the start of detention, instead of within 60 days, which was the standard before, according to the shelter staff
Many of them will appear in court via videoconference, rather than in person, to advocate for their application for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those considered not eligible for aid will be deported soon.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish 'occupying powers' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be handled accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Moualem said the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "a possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favourable for their return and condemned "some Western countries spreading irrational fears" that would keep most refugees away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They're politicizing a cause that should only be a humanitarian problem".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has opened the door for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has reversed a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines", saying he hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for postwar Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many "liberal" viewers likely hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by impeachment and scandal.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever".
At this time, however, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewing on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings for cable shows with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with major news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi driver in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the storylines coming out of Washington could affect the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you find yourself watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of "deep-ground" sources by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", who are talking about Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth peacock jacket (a garment full of exaggeration according to The Washington Post) and who are discussing the implications of Stormy Daniels' colorful description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
At least I'll never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he puts you in a new place every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of 'Pawn Stars,' about the rotating casting of the Trump show and the daily plot twists (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you get the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh having to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those weird shows not so long ago, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right".

Money flows from outside into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing an influx of money thanks to a reorganization of a constituency that will force two sitting Republicans to run for the same seat.
The newly redistricted Pittsburg district is meeting Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take on another sitting Republican, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were redistributed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional (grimandering) in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fight over campaign finance between the financial poor of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-attended special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat had been held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump had won this district by 20 percentage points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for aiding China and has refused to do so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings were taking place, North American and Central American officials proposed a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making any possible criminal action against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now for Vice President Mike Pence to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government's emphasis on the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further ado, without harsh messages about Washington's sanctions.
A White House spokesman on Mr Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible counter-intervention of the judiciary, for which overwhelming evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia in a Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changes color, Trump will have to answer to that institution, just as he's getting ready to turn to the voters again, and maybe he will have to answer to a jury in a court of law.
That's a lot of myths, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, or that of his European counterparts.
There will be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a "coup d'état" against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or slowed.
Americans are currently facing several of these types of bends.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that last year he suggested secretly recording conversations with the president and that he had speculated about the president's suitability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not true.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table that depicted a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers are visiting Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to be won and ended the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won in the end, but looking at the whole game, a tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game, too, but if the audience is behind us, I'm sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, of all the things that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a feel-good factor hanging on the club.
The team's good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can push through now, put the past season behind us and be successful again".
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of their pensions
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to receive care, few people discussed this with their relatives.
About half of the Nationwide survey participants said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they'd talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Consider a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or using your own capital as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up legal documents: Avoid legal disputes when using insurance.
Provide a health authority so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals adhere to your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that the bills are paid when you can no longer do so yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes".
Man shot multiple times with air-pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air-cooled rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 P.M. local time, as an "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
As the means of communication have been turned off, the official authorities have not yet received any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Middel Celebes, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in North Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were found dead.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters [10 feet] that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Regency in Atjeh, causing devastation and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but over 100 people died from collapsing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and providing resistance during the trial, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su's custody with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "not guilty, sure" when asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now serving the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under control in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly committed to his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Celebes, northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overthrowing pedestrians and cyclists who came his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent seeking the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by death, according to the document filed with the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment on 22 counts, including eight counts of racket-related murder, typically one used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and one count of violent and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation", according to prosecutors, who described Sajpov's conduct as "atrocious, cruel and corrupt".
"Sajfoello Habiboellayevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the intention statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed two years earlier after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, they the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had earlier asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize a people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he take over the EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham marchers that the UK would be "out of the gate" if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge for May to reconcile the highly divided ranks is underlined by two pro-Remain conservatives who are taking part in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track as it is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
The European Parliament has also called for a new framework for the European Union to be set up to promote the development of the European Union.
Bone told a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "throw Chequers in the trash can".
He proposed that Farage should be ridiculed and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had done the duty, we'd be out now", Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the trash can".
In clarifying his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed their mind and wants to stay in the EU is completely false".
Conservative Brexit leader Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and among our activists who go door-to-door and get us elected.
Drop the Chequers and listen".
In a direct message to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the meeting that politicians must feel the "heat" if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not letting you get away with this.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to set fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has won the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we are once again an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this march with a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags with Tories Against Brexit on them after the group was formed over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour member of the House of Commons, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to "think hard" about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think hard about her candidacy for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a meeting at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican congressman who co-chaired Trum's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been the focus of speculation that she might be in the running with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One of the presenters asked her if she would run for president.
Warren replied that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our flawed government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims of LSU
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died from the effects", police commander Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and admitted to being present at the scene, to having a firearm and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-1, Baton Rouge, La., junior who played in 32 games and started 10 games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching world title after Sebastian Vettel left him with the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold as he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit and let Hamilton in the busy driving in the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back to the lead after a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari rider to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and finished seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a while, as he stuck to his tyre choice and aimed for a quick finish so he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually, he went to the pit in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman, and he just missed me.
The team has done its best for places one and two", Hamilton said.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during an election meeting on Saturday over her persistence in not being the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people can be 'common, rude and untrue.'"
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate these last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and mean and rude and untrue", he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
- Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer? Did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't", he added, in imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter citing the allegations made against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with it confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, just as she had asked".
But the president didn't believe her denial and commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to seize power back, with all necessary means.
You see the ugliness, the dishonesty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to ride to seize power and regain control", the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars to Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals to lead by scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie sidelined the home team before Dwyer took the Giants back to the front.
Francois Bouchard tied the match for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up for a draw on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season the two teams have met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the assist that doubled Beauvillier's lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Marquardt took the lead for Cownie's tiebreaker at 5:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants into the first period of rest with a lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recovered and Bouchard again tied them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the title game for the first time, late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making sure hundreds can escape the earthquake in a plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being honored as a hero after he died for making sure a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a major earthquake hit Celebes Island on Friday, an earthquake that later caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still afflicting the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild back and forth traffic towers of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was ready at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic towers, thinking they were about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart to hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared that the death toll could rise to the thousands and informed the country's disaster management agency that access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities was restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six metres have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Bodies are being brought in by ambulances every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimum markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is a tragedy now, but it can get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for the evacuation.
Are you ready for this?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lombok hit Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the crashed flight in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing after earlier reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had left the sunken plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they've been working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane went down while landing at Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news", Jaynes said.
Jaynes told me that he and a few others managed to swim through the water that reached their midst to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working nearby at a yard also helped with the rescue work by taking people ashore in a blasting boat before the plane sank further into the water some 30 meters [30 feet] deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered with PNG over the past 20 years, but none of these have been related to Air Niugini.
Analyst tracks the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requirement on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone landline data to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again began talking to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness stand Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford's in his truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details on his phone.
"He knew her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense starts Sunday with the lockdown arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
What is "conscious hip-hop"?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre's negative image by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argue that hip-hop has been alienated from its origins by political views and addressing social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City midwife sues a married couple for a "racist" text
A New York nursing home sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after receiving a misspelled text complaining that the mother had "a black man again".
The couple denies being racist and calls the lawsuit "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first day at work in 2016.
"NOTHING is SO WARRING", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice at least twice.
According to the New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her mistake, stating that their former babysitter, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for $350 a day for the six months she was hired to intern with the family, though without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do that", Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple defended themselves against the allegation that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they feared that they could no longer trust her by insulting her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,' her husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
You're not going to get out of here".
Comparing the lawsuit to "blackmail", Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That is not very nice,' the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quickly becoming more and more aware of the couple's social media presence, where they are being hailed for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared the public would not be very interested in a talking bear, reveals a newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very entertaining".
She told her father, who before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, worked as a cameraman for the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very prominent member of the family", she told me that her father was secretly proud of the eventual success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man".
"But because Paddington was so vivid to him, it almost seemed like a child's achievement; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he experienced Paddington's success in that way.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear for success".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was not expected to make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's phone call came in saying she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your baby so much.
We'll be back together soon.
I'll be back with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly exhausted her body.
She had died some time before, and this trial turned everything upside down.
All I could do was sit there, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't whine, scream, or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep myself big".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trials she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.'
Women mourning post messages on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are making a fortune to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting inspiring messages and phone numbers that help people in need call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room".
Yet he stopped working before he died because he was deep in the pit.'
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis made the maps; "to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Do not keep silent - talk about it.'
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids were unpacking their presents, he wasn't looking at them at all or anything.'
She said his death was a major trauma for her, but that they had to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting.'

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI investigates.
'I thought that if we could do what he asked for, a limited investigation in time and scale, we might be able to create a little more unity,' Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was 'disintegrating' amid a firmly entrenched dispute within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their restraint is all about timing.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing poorly, their efforts to get their husband elected to the country's highest court will be seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
Then there's a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean survivors "down" under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean infiltrators into South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seek, who cites data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors in the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can cross more easily than in the heavily-secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the robbers to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they discussed the stagnant negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed broadly to work toward the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not making any progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the US' actions, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and finds him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and coordinated character murder", organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats", Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to institute impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this about it; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he's unfit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's serving now", Pelosi declared.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried that Kavanaugh would speak out against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, which is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided questions about reviewing certain Supreme Court decisions during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to cheer when a hysterical, biased person is appointed to the Supreme Court", Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It's a just tirade of months and years of raging anger that's been running rampant, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge of something and told me that she would cry when she got angry, and she developed a method where every time she got angry, she would cry, and then she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant".
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially unintelligible.
One of my best memories of my previous job in a male-dominated office is when I had to cry terribly because I was so angry, and an older woman, a cold business executive that everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in the neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they put you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Party, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat' or 'monkey streets') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not run.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she told me 30 years later, smiling.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was already progressing, she was behind in fundraising, and so she solemnly vowed not to participate if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
'Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?' she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with feelings -- of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of deputies, and of anger over sexism -- that she choked.
'You may have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media's reaction to her.
"They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
She was crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can End for Beijing
The opening salvoes of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle has not yet been fought, experts say a gap between the two countries could be a long-term boon for Beijing.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued the first warning by raising taxes on key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion in goods, half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has taken reprisals in kind every time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to match the United States every time, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to blink quickly.
To get Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but public bow to the United States is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing acts smart, the trade war with the US could support China in the longer term positively, as the mutual dependence of the two economies decreases.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead to economic free fall for either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged", says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues focused on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he says.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course in southwest Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary number of 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, dropped his long shot from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of four players to ever score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play to Ian Poulter of Great Britain, who may have played his last Ryder Cup match.
Spanish veteran Segrio Garcia, who has won eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not going to cry so soon, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who went on to defeat American legend Tiger Woods by two holes down and one hole in the singles game on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods, I've been following this guy all my life growing up", says Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled over the weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In a short time this morning we made Europe a little more difficult.
We were opposed.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players on his team were playing very well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're looking forward to it.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to take your hat off for the opponent.

Red globe update: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in Red Glove concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located off the west coast of Florida, USA).
The Committee said that there were reports of a fragmentary increase in red light in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decline in concentrations.
The Red Blast extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County of stains, but in fewer places than last week.
There's also been a red glow in Pasco County.
Medium-sized concentrations have been reported off the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations off or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations off or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are ongoing reports of airway irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
In northwest Florida, there have been no reports of airway irritation in the past week.
