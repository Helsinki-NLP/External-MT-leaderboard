Father Jozef Witko: I saw Jesus in the white robe
He's a charismatic guy.
His mass for deliverance and healing draws crowds.
When he was in his teens, unexplained things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.
The mass for liberation and healing held by Father Witko draws crowds
One day, the parents of a seven-month-old baby came to him with a hole in his heart that was 7.5 millimeters long.
He was going to have surgery.
Father Jozef Witko prayed for him.
That very day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The doctors were amazed and said: "No surgery is necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying with joy.
After another Franciscan prayer, the hole was completely gone.
As a teenager, he began to experience the Creator's wonderful spiritual works.
In his dreams, the souls of purgatory came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
My body started to change.
I lost my humanity and started to look like an animal, he says.
An invisible force was lifting him up, he couldn't get a voice out of himself.
He felt lost.
Then God pointed to his salvation.
"I was immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing the sacred baptism, I was released and returned to human form", he says.
He never told anyone about his strange experiences.
He had a calling.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He wanted to do more than just tell the story of Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic community Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people attend the healing services that Father Witko holds, hoping to get rid of their illness.
The minister, however, emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual, not physical, healing.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
On this afternoon (September 26th), Kolping FRAC team was awarded the title by the current champion of Poland Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
The Jaroslavs, in the personal comparison they presented with the Grodziszczyce, have a slim chance of winning against the sovereign league.
He showed it in the duel with Dart Bogoria.
The team is still missing a team leader named Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the squad the Jaroslavs would achieve a third consecutive triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han is probably not old enough to win against the likes of Panagiotis Gionis of Greece or Pavel Sirucek of the Czech Republic.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The Hellada wrestler was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall on Sikorsky Street in Jaroslavl.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were classed as his own.
After three fights, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badovsky and Daniel Górak after the exciting five-set match against Pavel Sirucka.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Leia a chance.
There was still hope of winning by two points, but Qiyao Han didn't face Badowski.
There will be no additional tests for seniors.
Why? Why?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its Medical Technology Protection and Tariff Agency.
The Agency explained in its justification that the target group was poorly selected.
"These actions may even affect the detectability of individual disease units, which may contribute to the difficulty of accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result", it said.
The president of the D.C. Department doesn't understand the decision.
The money is ours, we've got the money for it.
The government is just afraid that if people get tested, they'll go to the doctor later, which is ridiculous, because the point is to get to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
And all the experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in the reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can't imagine experts saying: 'Let's not test ourselves, because there will be long queues at the doctor's,' and if such experts are advising the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in this state", the politician added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of that country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the next government of Israel that is formed starts to implement this plan, we will cancel all the agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made", he announced.
"We will completely and completely reject the whole plan", Abbas threatened with pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by any means possible, whatever the consequences, by fully engaging in the enforcement of international law and the fight against terrorism", said the Palestinian Authority president, who made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, was re-assigned the task of forming a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would annex the Jordan Valley and incorporate all Jewish settlements in the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements under the auspices of the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold general elections in Palestinian territory during a session of the UN General Assembly.
The last one was in 2006.
"On my return, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will be held accountable before God and the international community", the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, as a permanent observer to the UN, to exercise the powers of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations resolutions in full".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than fighting against calls for terrorism in the Autonomous Region under his leadership".
However, Danon did not refer to Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands, the agencies reported.
Paramedics want defibrillators in the neuralgia points.
The story at the border crossing shows that an automatic defibrillator AED can save lives.
The Provincial Emergency Response Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be in the most sensitive parts of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Rescue Station in Przemyśl.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and the Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, while on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyc, a customs officer noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody from torture.
He wanted to use the rights guaranteed by the constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, received a phone call on September 23 from the Communist Party secretary in her home village to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Cause of death was not disclosed.
At the morgue, she saw her husband's body butchered, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all covered in blood", the woman said.
They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn't let me get close to Wang.
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Research and Development Center
Almost PLN 105 million of the funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were the development of an AR-based field game platform that maps the real world with a user-supported data-uploading application; a test-training platform for verifying practical skills at work and professional development using VR and AI; and an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the Industry 4.0 concept.
The objective of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10 percent per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1,85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2,23 billion.
The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the already PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important impetus for further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu, the press release reads.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
The government's incentives for entrepreneurs who are keen to innovate, such as R & D incentives, skills programmes, IP boxes and support programmes implemented by the NCBR, are driving the innovation activity of companies and allowing them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market, says Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Gowin, Minister of Science and Higher Education, quoted in the press release.
The head of the science department points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets  three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
The deductible R&D costs amounted to PLN 1,7 billion, which resulted in savings of over PLN 300 million for the companies benefiting from this relief.
This is equivalent to the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN, the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
The Director of the NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that in the two previous calls for proposals for co-financing totalling over PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.
The high level of interest in the third call for proposals and the variety of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competence to continue to develop and increase its competitive advantage.
"I am particularly pleased that among the projects selected, as in previous editions, there are projects for solutions not only for entertainment but also for Industry 4.0", he adds.
In the third call for proposals for GameINN, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs and scientific entities could apply for a subsidy of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of co-financing of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but was increased, so that 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information on the results of the GameINN III competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The sectoral programme GameINN is implemented under the Operational Programme Intelligent Development.
The NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to an initiative by the Polish Gaming Agreement's associated companies, which include companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga has confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg 's watch .
The incident occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who had made the journey from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, found his watch missing from his dressing room after training.
Not just any one, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane didn't show up for class the next day, citing stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
The players in the locker room have their own safe, and the club's grounds are monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane he'd return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
He arrived in Nice at the age of 13 and made his first-team debut three years later.
He's played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but according to the newspaper L'Equipe, the club will probably terminate him with immediate effect.
He's initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player for the time being.
Nice, at least officially, is declining to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands properly
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. after you come home or before you eat).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
That's especially important now with the fall infections coming.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for washing to remove harmful bacteria and viruses from your hands
And most of us wash them shorter!
It is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even recommend it).
When washing, not only the bottom and top of the hand are rubbed, but also the fingertips (together or individually)  the space between the fingers (hands over hand, rubbing fingers together), the thumbs  each thumb is wrapped around the other hand and twisted a little to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands), wipe your hands with a wet towel and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, starting at $5).
Do not touch the door or door handle with your washed hands after using a public toilet (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iranian president says he rejected US offer to talk, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York despite the US offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side had asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have offered to lift all sanctions against Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Rouhani: Iran will not negotiate in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president has stated that he has not agreed to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He claimed he met with American diplomats because he was pressured by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final outcome will be", Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of supporting U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal were a precondition that did not allow dialogue to take place.
If we can get this precondition lifted and if America can get the sanctions and maximum pressure lifted, then of course we can talk to America", he declared.
He added that he did not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian request.
Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions so we could meet.
Of course I said no! The President of the United States tweeted.
Tensions with the nuclear deal in the background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in an attempt to somehow salvage the 2015 Iran deal to which they were signatories.
It provided that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and place its nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed their intention to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing has come of it.
Washington has a tactic of maximizing pressure on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive permission to export the raw material, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who according to her words and WhatsApp screenshots, participated in the stalking of judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, and there is therefore no basis to maintain the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary counsel at the NSA, opened an investigation into Schmydt in late August, but it has not yet developed into a case against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the WSA president within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental health problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of participation in a hate group, will return to the court and will issue sentences on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hat group.
He claims there's no evidence of that other than faked screens and the words of his wife, who he's divorcing.
The same thing the other judges associated with the "Caste" are saying: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's possible they'll go their separate ways.
Because the prosecution hasn't lifted a finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, and they're also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she seized in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of the people who were identified as the stalkers in a February report by Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence. There is no case of Schmidt. There is no case of Kastya.
There's also no case of NIK boss Marian Banas renting a bra house to a bridesmaid and hiding the proceeds.
CBA's checking his estate.
And he'll check when he does.
And the Parliamentary Ethics Committee will not deal with Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow met to make the curious decision to dismiss Banas' deputies and appoint him as his deputy lawyer, although the law does not foresee such a strange combination).
It reminds me of a movie, an American novel, I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband in bed with his mistress.
She's so shocked and devastated, she can't get a word out.
She stands at the door, sleepy, and in the meantime, the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses, and leaves.
And the husband was making the bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and yells, "What's that?"
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
Only the case of Kastya or Banasi is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny.

Kamila Litvinko in the final of the high jump
Earlier this season, returning to competition after a maternity break, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Championships in London, in the first attempt she beat 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
She didn't get to 1.94 until the third approach.
I'm pleased.
I showed that I can fight, because the first attempt was a complete failure.
I'll have to jump better in the final technically, Litvinkova admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the eliminations, the best were the Americans Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karina Demidik  with 1.94.
Both players are the only ones who didn't drop any altitude.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Starting at 7.30pm Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in critical condition.
He's in the hospital, and the doctors are calling his condition serious.
I'd add that he's conscious and conscious.
We believe he'll come out of it, that he'll win again.
We all pray for his recovery, an anonymous person close to Cornelio Morawiecki told reporters on the Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My family and politicians are the ones who keep me alive", Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with the "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was admitted to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for examinations.
I developed some strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When I was scanned by a CT scan, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Warsaw.
Morawiecki said that President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation took about three hours and was a success.
I know a lot of people have been praying for me, and I thank you very much.
I'm glad I'm not a metastatic. I'm not a metastatic. I'm not a metastatic.
I don't know if I'm going to get chemo yet.
I'm going to put myself in the hands of some medical specialists who are rather well-meaning.
For now, after this grueling surgery, I need to get back to some sort of utility.
I hope everything will be fine, said Kornel Morawiecki in January in an interview with the European Commission.
"If I had been too late, it would have been a tragedy and I would have said goodbye to this bastard"...
Krakow: 14-year-old girl is missing
Officers from the City Police Command in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stokłosa.
Anyone with any information on the missing girl is requested to contact us.
The missing woman left her residence on the evening of September 26 and has not returned to her home or made contact with her family.
She was last seen in Stara Gościniec street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklos is 14 years old, 5'6", has blond hair and blue eyes.
Last time she was seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police on 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112,997.
The power of the leaping.
The title of the report on the amateur sports competition, which took place on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the racecourse in Oleandra Street in Oławia, may be misleading to some.
It's a long way to true power, but that's what one of the most famous horse racing events is called...
The power jump competition involves the rider and horse overcoming increasingly high obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed two meters.
It is worth noting that the long-standing and still unbroken world record, set back in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel on the horse Huaso, is 247 cm.
Of course, nobody has ever jumped this high in Olav, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is not among the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "In the Saddle" were a demonstration of the "Torch riding" events that had been held there a little earlier, which we write about in more detail in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons entered the competition, training to ride in the Olav JKS.
Four competed on ponies, and four on big horses.
The best of the first group was Nikola Shlodra, riding a crazy Sprinter.
This small but dynamic rover began by overcoming obstacles that were 40 centimeters high and finished at a station with a top beam 125 centimeters above the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from further competition by the competition jury.
The second place in the pony jump was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding the "Famy", and the third by Lena Boruń on the "Harmider".
The youngest contestant, Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare Carmen, was ambitious.
Even more excitement was felt by the Amazons and the spectators at the big horse competition.
The most dangerous falls were Paulina Shevczyk, riding the Declaration, and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the Lotus.
Fortunately, apart from minor injuries, neither the Amazons nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to compete.
The younger Wineta had a lot of trouble getting her on the parkour.
She needed either an assistant trainer or another horse to pair with, followed by a little crazy Winnie.
After the obstacle was cleared from the parking lot, she was also driving at full speed, so at times it was dangerous in the boxes and in the stretcher room. "Everything is under control!" said Jan Sienkiewicz, reassuring the frightened spectators, especially the youngest.
Since the start of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been doing great on the parkour, riding a beautifully presented "Whisky".
This fine mare, paired with an experienced Amazon, after the second approach in the final stage, was the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.
However, after a while, the same height was also achieved by Paulina Szewczyk on Declaration, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on Winet and Anastasia Abramenko on Lotce.
So, to decorate the flo and to receive the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these athletes went together, and finally, together with the Amazons on the pony rides in the rhythm of the Radecki march, they performed a spectacular round of honor, ending this interesting and exciting competition.
Thank you .
The W Siodle Riding Sports Club would like to thank the sponsors of the jump competition during the 16th Ring of the Rainbow Riding Competition: the Oława City Hall, the Oława Water and Sewerage Plant, the Regional Municipality and the company Mustang.
Max Kolonko is cutting off from the W.C.P. Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was aiming its proposal especially at young, right-wing voters.
Before the elections, Kolonko promised to cooperate with Mark Jakubiaki or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions came to pass, and the KWW Patriotiska Rewolucja of Max Kolonko himself was not even able to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I'll wait for the WTC to cross my name out of the name.
Please do not associate me with the above-mentioned entity, he added, and announced that he would provide more information soon.
It is not known if the journalist will continue his work or if this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, the American Independence Day, Mariusz Max Kolonko, a journalist based in the US, announced the formation of a new political party - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko became famous for running the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
We've had enough of your politicians, your stupid games, your amateur governments.
It's time for the government to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation, Kolonko said.
The party's programme included issues such as the judiciary (it should be elected in a general election), tax reforms (equating the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the eastern NATO states, with particular regard to Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, reducing the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political party, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiaki.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15.
But none of these coalitions were ever formed.
UBS: Gold near equilibrium
"The euro will remain around the PLN 4.35 level in the coming months, accompanied by weakness in global markets", says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
Expectations of a solid growth rate and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising the zloty quotation at the current ceiling, says the expert in an interview with Bankier.pl.
He said that despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council would not decide to raise interest rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
 If the gold is properly valued  the euro should remain around the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months  Polish bonds are less attractive, he says.
Emerging market bonds offer much better returns than Polish bonds, says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
"The global slowdown may continue, but it should not lead to a severe recession, and at most to a slightly below-zero GDP growth", says Michael Bolliger.
Investors should underestimate global stocks, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for a resolution of the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Among equity markets, Europa is expected to be the weakest relative to the rest, according to the latest letter to investors from Mark Haefele, chief executive of UBS Wealth Management.
"Euro area stocks should perform worse than US stocks because they are more vulnerable to increased global trade uncertainty and slowdown concerns", the paper says.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the crash in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of the German 10-year-old even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.
However, in the longer term, the yields of long-term securities should not fall, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of monetary policy by banks.
The Fed has the biggest field for interest rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro quotations is the USD 1.29 ceiling, which would represent a 19 per cent strengthening potential of the single currency against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy disparities around the world.
"Current account and budget deficits may not be enough to keep the dollar strong in the long run", says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
Confidential report of the German MON
The Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition since the beginning of 2014  according to a confidential inventory prepared by the German Defence Ministry.
The information was reported by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weaponry and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have been recovered so far.
Military equipment still missing include six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 rifles are missing for MG3 machine guns.
The situation is particularly worrying for the Left Party's deputy leader, Martina Renner.
She told RND reporters that the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming".
Especially since the investigation has only found a small fraction of the lost equipment.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "serious balance".
She also criticised the fact that the list does not show whether there are also weapons found during the investigation against Lieutenant General Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations against leading German politicians with extreme right-wing and racist motives.
His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally possessed four firearms, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and over 50 explosive charges.
Crying kids on a plane.
How can we avoid them?
There is a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for those who have a nightmare experience of traveling with a crying child.
The airlines can check the seating arrangements on the aircraft via the website.
If a minor under the age of two is travelling on the route, the child icon appears on a specific seat reserved by the parent or guardian.
The carrier's user can therefore choose a place that is far from the place occupied by the child.
The BBC reports that the airlines have already informed the public about the imperfections of this solution.
The 'child icon' will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if there was a last-minute change of plane.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by the Internet.
Some Twitter users suggest that the problem of traveling with crying babies can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be kids.
"We need to learn tolerance because soon we will need seating maps for mouth-breathing, drooling and drunkards", wrote user G Sundar.
Another Internet user noted that he used to be bothered by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children during the 13-hour journey", wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major is counting losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be able to come to Majorca for their holidays in October as a result of the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency announced on Monday.
On Friday, Marc Pons, a representative of the autonomous Balearic government, said that among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of their October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who will have to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of a British company are German and Scandinavian nationals.
However, Pons argues that, since Thomas Cook did not send tourists to the Balearic Islands between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already started negotiations with international operators to enter the Mallorcan market following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that in October, the tourist crisis will lead to the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in Majorca.
About 800 of them are laid off from Thomas Cook's Palma office.
The rest of the people will lose their jobs, mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy, many hotels in Majorca were asking guests to pay extra for their accommodations.
This situation has been experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland, among others.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had suspended operations until at least the end of October following the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its affiliates.
The daily newspaper Diario de Ibiza on Friday reported that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have partnered with the Thomas Cook group are not planning to close in the coming weeks.
The paper recalls that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government for regional support of €100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.
They found that the biggest number of tourists affected, some 36,000, were on Majorca.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is behind local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, on contracts for the period from July to September 2019 of around EUR 5 million.
The women's FIFA rankings.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in first place
The women's national team of Poland is ranked 29th in the ranking published on Friday by the International Football Federation (FIFA).
At the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous, July ranking.
Bad team games.
How's October going to be?
The leaders are the Americans, who recently defended their world title.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third was the Dutch.
The Polish girls are preparing for the ME qualifiers.
They were supposed to start with a home game against the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by one year because of food poisoning.
In this situation, the Poles will open the qualifiers with a match against the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
The Red and White will play two friendly matches on 3 October against Cyprus and five days later against Brazil in Kielce.
The Polish team is made up of the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Spain.
The group winners and the three best second-placed teams advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six second-placed teams will play in the Dams for the last three European Championship passes.
The 16-man squad will be supplemented by England.
The men's national team of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
Smog has crushed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air programme are negligible and coal-fired power stations will be burning as if nothing had ever happened", reads the front page of today's edition of the Communiqué.
 So far, 82 000 applications for funding totalling PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48 000 have been successful.
The total amount of applications accepted is over PLN 915 million, reports "Rz", citing data from a spokesman for the Ministry of the Environment.
The newspaper notes that the programme only reimburses a portion of the costs incurred.
The results of the highly-announced program are described as "modest".
Local authorities, quoted by the RZ, see the failures of the Clean Air Act, including too much bureaucracy.
The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, invoices by post, and, if necessary, a random check of implementation.
This would improve the situation, says the mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński, Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm point out that in the first year of the campaign less than 1 percent of the set goal of replacing 3 million digging boilers was achieved.
As Rz notes, although the program budget is PLN 103 billion over 10 years, or PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management has been set aside for this year at a rate of PLN 1.4 billion", we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Now the price negotiations
The US Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
"This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work", Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to get the best price", the Polish minister added.
Polish F-35 contract
The Polish Air Force is targeting 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department approved the sale of the weapons to Poland.
The communication underlined that the investment would support US national security and foreign policy by enhancing the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jets.
But it's not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also cover the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and human resources services and related elements of logistics support and programme and staff training.
The following aircraft are to be used:
The F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine, fifth-generation multi-role fighter aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin.
The aircraft is capable of close support, bombing and typically fighter-to-air combat missions.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable by close-range radar.
Belgium recently purchased F-35 fighters under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want them to replace the aging F-16s.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also reportedly considering buying American fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The Barbie company has launched a line of sex-neutral dolls.
It's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
The Barbie manufacturer has launched a line of sex-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, figures, and hairstyles, Mattel has introduced sex-neutral dolls.
The toys in the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
So the kids can decide whether their Barbie has short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can go from being girls to being boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
The emphasis on gender identity has also been dropped  Gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a thin waist or  in Ken's case  broad shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have gender norms imposed on them, and some parents and feminists believe that gender-specific toys inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will make all children feel free", says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high-heeled shoes, has been criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes" such as unnatural body proportions.
The company responded to the criticism and has already launched dolls with different skin colors and more rounded shapes.
There were also hijab dolls.
Zandberg: the circle or club together can have a dozen MPs
Zandberg was asked by ZET radio how many candidates his party could get into the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list of candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Leftists Together, starting with the common logo Lewica), he replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are linking hope with the fact that the Left is not only right but also has power", he said.
According to Zandberg, this means that the left can have 60 to 80 MPs.
This may mean that the Razem club will have a dozen members.
But that depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I'm not going to guess and say how it's going to happen, he said.
Asked if Left Together would have a separate round, Zandberg replied: "We are committed to being diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles because we showed that by being different, we could agree on a common program.
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he thinks the biggest beneficiaries are center-left and left-wing voters.
He also said that the SLD would receive all the subsidies, but that the political party's goal is to represent its voters.
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the parliamentary elections.
In the case of the Senate elections, he indicated that he was considering it.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates who are closer to my heart, but there are also those who are further away from my heart", he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District 44, I would take my electoral certificate and vote in another district", the politician stressed.
"I don't think I would have voted for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (the KO-PAP candidate) ", he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are running.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car, and foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built that could seat 30,000 worshippers.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi sect of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago on a six-hectare wetland area donated by the government.
The name of the Masjid of Jinan (道至天堂) comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, revered by followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Karrarian marble and has five minarets.
The tallest one is 78 meters.
The mosque inside can accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the other 15,000 can be housed on the outer esplanade.
The richly finished interiors feature a gilded dome, gigantic chandeliers, and handmade decorations by Moroccan craftsmen.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the gmach is still not comparable to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.
The mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to the land, the government financed lighting, sanitation and road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a win will be broken by the crown players in Friday's meeting with the multi-leader of the extra-class Silesia.
"Our problem is not the wrestling, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play", said the coach of the wrestling team Miroslav Smyla.
The last and so far only league victory for the Crown players came in the first round, when they beat the 1-0 outright from the Binyamin of the Częstochowa Cancers.
Later, the Kielczyns recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Zagłębi Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
What makes me optimistic is that in the last seconds of the cup game, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the brick after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close, Smilla said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will train the team to play in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play", the coach added.
In the Friday match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic, who was suspended for too many yellow cards, will not play, and the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be absent.
What's encouraging is that a few players are willing to play in a cup game.
"We have a headache, it seemed like it wasn't going to happen, but now it is", said Smyla.
Crown defender Daniel Strange said Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the eight-match streak without a win, while in the top flight, anyone can win against anyone.
We make a good team.
"We may not have shown it on the pitch in the last few weeks, but we will win and we believe it will be on Friday", he said.
After nine rounds, the extra-classes crown with five points is in 15th position.
Silesia has 12 more and is in second place.
The game in Kielce starts at 8.30 on Friday.
These trees could disappear from Europe completely.
 42% of the tree species that make up Europe's forest are threatened, warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
The lists are topped by chestnuts and dandelions.
The IUCN, based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who, on the basis of their studies, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are 'highly endangered'.
The Red Book lists rapid urban growth and global climate change as causes.
But the most endangered are the trees and shrubs that are found only or mainly on our continent.
Of the typical European woodland, 58 percent of the species are threatened, and 15 percent, 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction, according to the IUCN.
The main causes of deforestation are listed in the Red Book as forestry errors, accelerated urbanisation, excessive deforestation, and subsequent forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
The report also highlights the serious threat to the survival of many European varieties of shrubs, ferns and herbaceous plants.
'Human activities are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and threatening to wipe out important and under-appreciated varieties in Europe, which are the foundation of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet', concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.
I'm not going to promise 600+.
Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a distribution for their freedom on a loan that future generations will have to pay back, says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolita".
He thinks the whole politics of the PiS is a joke.
At the same time, the politician promises that what is given will not be taken away.
Schetyna assures Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczynski's party.
"Today, there are more people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of PiS, a party that has misrepresented the values it proclaims, such as modesty, humility, transparency", says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic assumptions of the electoral program of the KO.
"Firstly, nothing given will be taken away, but we need to set a direction for the future, because PiS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is seen even after dramatically low investments", he said.
Secondly, it is about mobilizing the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurial.
Schetyna explains that the KO program included a project that will give the least-paid Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners  also several hundred.
The politician also indicated that he did not want to run for the post.
He said he'd do as much as he can, but he's not promising 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the ruling party bid with the opposition for distribution, until finally the country's financial collapse", he stressed.
Schetyna also stated in an interview for Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Blonska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda", he said.
Pride comes before failure.
Kaczynski is as much a statesman as Banaš is a crystal, he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not decided yet whether to run for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead giant condor beetles have been found
Six dead giant condor were found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The giant condors were probably poisoned with a chemical to kill predators like cougars, foxes, and wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten the toxic carcass.
Except for one young, the rest of the dead condor were adults.
This is a big environmental loss, because a condor must live for 10 to 15 years before it can become fertile and reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species, says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison is putting not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health", he adds.
They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on the award of a precious chain to the head of state.
The idea was supported by the law firm of Andrzej Duda.
The newspaper explains that it is a gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic during the interwar period.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.
The Russian says that soon such a chain may fall on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted Wednesday to begin work on amending the Order and Medal Act to restore it.
The newspaper says this isn't the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state either.
The Senate proposed this amendment back in 1992, but it was defeated by one vote.
This time, the work is fast.
In early August, senators spent several minutes discussing the issue, agreeing to seek the opinion of the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I would like to inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position expressed in this petition", presidential minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
The President's office has given us a short answer: it is in favour of restoring it, said the head of the commission, Robert Mamutov of PiS, quoted by the Russian newspaper.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the committee supported.
The police will teach the drivers how to drive through the intersection
Police action will be conducted at the intersection of Cieplinski and Piłsudski.
The uniform action is related to recent complaints from city officials about drivers not always being able to behave properly at intersections.
On Friday, September 27, police officers in the Reich begin preventive measures at "Transit crossings".
It's about eliminating traffic jams: driving into intersections without the possibility of a descent, not following traffic lights or road signs.
"We often think we are alone at crossroads, but in reality we make life difficult for other drivers", said Marek Ustrobiński, the city's vice president, a few days ago.
His words were made at a press conference at the city hall, where the city authorities presented examples of improper traffic at intersections, which results in traffic jams.
The president then appealed to travelers to exercise caution on the road, including speeding at traffic lights and not texting while driving.
The issue has been taken over by the police in the district, who are starting the "Transit Crossings" campaign today.
What's the matter, man?
The aim of the measures is to eliminate the effect of restricting the flow of traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
This is a common offence that contributes to increased traffic congestion and traffic jams.
He's facing a $300 warrant and two points.
In addition, uniforms will be alerted to non-compliance with traffic lights and signs and to improper parking in intersection areas.
They will also observe lack of smooth driving, late start under signals, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
Which intersections will be used?
The following are the names of the buildings in the district: Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellońska Street; Ciepliński Street from Piłsudski Street; Targowa Street from Piłsudski Street; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw Uprising Street.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held on the following Friday of October.
They checked out the waste disposal company from "Czajk".
Officers from the Environmental Protection Department of the Volominska Municipality and the Regional Building Supervision Inspectorate inspected the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the wastewater treatment plant Czajka in Warsaw is disposed, the spokesman of the Volominska Municipality Karol Szyszko said.
The inspectors from the Volominska Municipality carried out an inspection at a plant in the forests of the municipality of Zielonka.
The private commercial-transport facility Dar-Trans, under a contract with the municipal wastewater treatment plant Čačka, provides waste management services.
"The installation was inspected and the contractor was asked to provide documentation related to his activities", Szyszko said.
He added that the inspection report will be submitted to the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Voivodeship Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out groundwater sampling, measurement and testing, and that it did not have the results of the tests of the established municipal sewage deposits from the Czajka wastewater treatment plant.
After the CBI review, Dariusz Sobota was asked to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The private commercial-transport plant DAR-TRANS Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage from the treatment plant Czajka.
According to the decision to conduct waste disposal at the site, up to 60 000 tonnes of waste are processed in the forests near Zielonki each year.
The Warsaw Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company reported on Thursday that the STUOS was shut down in November and December 2018 due to the damage to one of the incinerator devices.
The Commission also notes that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
Lech Walesa has supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support", Lech Walesa told Małgorzata Kidawa-Blonska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me", the candidate of the Civic Coalition for Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw, replied.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now "only a retired fan".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Walesa on Friday at his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdansk.
The short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wałęsa's son  Jarosław.
"You have taken on a difficult task", he said after meeting Lech Walesa.
"You can count on my full support", he added.
The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, I hope that you as a woman will be able to solve these problems, and we all who love Poland will support your efforts to the maximum", the former president said, addressing Kidawa-Blonska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because nobody like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and knows how important it is", she said.
Let's show that we can make different, smart policies together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland, Kidawa-Błońska stressed.
Retired fan
Walesa told reporters he is now a retired fan.
Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope we can reverse the course of events, that what was good, what was proven, we can return to.
The tripartite power is paramount, the constitution is paramount, the courts are indispensable.
And all of that has to be cleaned up, all of that has to be restored to normal, and I believe we're going to do that this time.
Because if not, we will face the street criterion, said Lech Walesa.
That's why it's so important that Poles go to the polls, think about it and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing, she added.
"Last chance to improve the situation in Poland with a piece of paper", the former president replied.
We must rebuild the foundation
Asked what changes she believes should be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The president has spoken very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no tripartite power, since the constitution is not respected, we have to go back to the beginning and make it so that it becomes obvious and so that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move forward.
The finalists: Slovenia vs Poland 3-1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot terrain in Lublan Polish skaters faced Slovenes in the semi-finals of the European championships.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussions with the judges, with the coach of the Poles, Vital Heynen, in the lead role.
The White-Reds are down 3-1 and they're going for the bronze medal.
The Senate has passed a key piece of legislation
The Senate passed the bill without amendment on the disclosure of the family assets of top state officials and the flight of the most important people in the country.
The amendment to the law on the assets of civil servants' families  without amendments  was approved by 52 senators, 14 against, three abstaining.
The senators thus decided to reject the 12 amendments, submitted during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to 'civilize' the law and to limit the scope of information on the financial situation of children of one's own, children of one's spouse, children adopted in cases where children remain in the same household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The law on disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, drafted by the Prime Minister's Office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The rules stipulate that the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, Senators, Presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as heads of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the declaration of assets information on the personal assets of spouses, children and persons living together.
The Senate has also failed to pass an amendment to the state's top flight law.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important people in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
The bill was passed with 55 votes in favour, 12 against and four abstentions.
By law, every presidential flight is an official mission.
The President will be accompanied on flights by family members and other persons invited by the President.
The official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate will only be a flight  to carry out tasks directly related to the function.
The law also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
The rules allow members of delegations  invited Members of Parliament, senators, public authorities and experts; technical, medical or organisational support staff; and journalists to be on board.
According to the law, if there are any doubts about the flights of the marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate's Chancellery of the impossibility of organising such a flight.
The new sports commissioner
Waldemar Paluch has appointed his Commissioner for Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism.
He was appointed by Artur Świątek, long-time president of the University Club AZS PWSTE Jarosław, for the last 4 years director of the Office of the Rector of the Jarosław University.
Bartłomiej Pacek Artur Świątek was recently heavily involved in the project of the rehabilitation of the basketball in Jarosław.
Artur Świątek is not an anonymous figure in the Jaroslavski sports world.
Graduate of the Academy of Physical Education in Biała Podlaska since 2002 is an instructor at the State Higher Technical and Economic School in Jarosław, and for 15 years has been the president of the Academy.
The Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish skaters held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will compete for the bronze medal on Saturday.
The way to the title was closed by the defeat of the Slovenes 1:3 in Ljubljana on Thursday.
Word was they were having trouble getting to the fight.
This time, they were without such problems  on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes to Paris by charter, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to reports from those present at the class, the World Champion trainer was nervous.
As Heyenen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, the main task this time was not just to practice the volleyball elements.
We went to the gym, but for the most part it was band time.
It was more about spending time together than training.
Talk, think about how we can rebuild as a team, he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
We were brutally brought to the ground.
We're disappointed, without a doubt.
We still believed we'd be back in this game.
We discussed this game with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
The two main reasons for failure I would point to inefficiency in attack and much worse than usual handling of situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect, he analyzed.
He said the Red and White were not hampered by the stress of performing against the tournament's co-hosts, who were supported by a loud and large crowd.
He admitted that the world champions could have been a little bit asleep on the way to the semifinals.
Maybe if we had a similar setback in the group stage, we would have learned the lesson sooner and then played the next round of the tournament differently.
But that's only if you're a man, he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger over the Polish defeat on Thursday will turn into aggression in the bronze match.
I hope we show our true colors then.
There's a lot to fight about.
The last time we won an ME medal was in 2011, he reminded me.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage matches they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-finals they moved to Lublanca.
Nick Kyrgios: severely punished but suspended
An Australian tennis player has been given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine for six months of suspension for offensive words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgios, but they're still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most brazen professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening  16 weeks off plus a hefty fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months  a probationary period during which the brazen athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been working for a long time and has set a kind of world tennis record - he had to pay the highest single penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of conduct on and off the court.
He's been making loud swearing, weird gestures, unsporting behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets in a losing match with Karen Chachanov. All of this after the ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati in August, he paid $113,000.
He didn't play for long at the 2019 US Open, but he did publicly say that ATP activists were corrupt, which hurt the organization so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and a few weeks later issued the aforementioned suspension and another fine.
But the corruption allegations were forgiven, after hearing the accused and learning the context of his remarks.
However, in their statement, the tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios's behavior over the past 12 months was in many cases a serious concern and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he was constantly insulting tournament officials and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering him to comply with several conditions within the next six months: he must no longer violate the rules of conduct of professional tennis players in any way on the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour, in particular he must no longer swear, destroy the racquet, argue with the judges and the audience, or behave in any other way that is indecent or vulgar.
He was also advised to seek 'continuous support' from mental trainers during tournaments and also consult with people who specialize in dealing with athletes who are not coping with their behaviour.
Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: "Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all.
In practice, the Australian will have at least two weeks off, as his shoulder injury in the Lavera Cup has worsened, so he had to give up the next starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6 October - 13 October).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
He won two tournaments this year in Washington and Acapulco, and he's made over $1.3 million, so even with the fines, he's got a lot of money left.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
A report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday showed that 44 percent of households rated their financial situation as good or rather good in the year to come.
The previous year, the figure was 37,2%, in 2016 it was 33,5%, and since 2009, when the Statistical Office first examined the subjective assessment of households, it has never exceeded 30%.
Overall, 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be poor or rather poor in the year to date, compared with 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of self-employed households.
In this group, more than 70 percent of the respondents consider it good, or rather good.
At the other end of the scale are the households of renters, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a large impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
Single parents are worst off, with 32 percent reporting good or rather good financial status.
Among couples with children, the proportion varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.
The impact of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and families with many children (with at least three children) were assessed as having the worst financial situation.
The improvement in subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
But that's not all, because the percentage of households who think their situation is good is growing faster than their real incomes.
Moreover, at the provincial level there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best scores are given by the inhabitants of the Opole region, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The following are the provinces of Lubus (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazovia (47.3%) and West Pomerania (47.1%).
In contrast, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average in the year, and in Lubuski, 98%.
The highest incomes were inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesian (104 percent).
The average disposable income per person in Poland was PLN 1693 in 2018.
The Union industry's sales volume increased by around 5% during the period considered.
This is a rather low figure compared to previous years.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth is slowing, it is also holding back spending growth.
The per capita figure for the year was PLN 1,187, which means that in real terms it fell by 0.7%.
This is the first case of this kind since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1,9% in real terms and by 4,3% in 2016.
Household budget surveys suggest that statistical households now spend 70.1% of their disposable income, compared with more than 80% in 2014 and more than 90% by 2006.

USA: Three aircrew suicides
Three sailors committed suicide last week aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members have been killed on this ship.
The previous suicide took place back in July of this year and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of these incidents occurred on land while the USS George H. W. Bush was docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the case has been ruled out.
And the deaths aren't supposed to be connected.
We need everyone to get involved in coming up with suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help", Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
Niesiowski is critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"Everything he said was accepted".
Later, criticism of some of his actions came.
To me, John Paul II's failure to stop the harmful activities of Rydzik... is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist  the harmful of the Church and Poland  developed his media in the best way during the life of the Pope Polish, he explained.
The former politician PO admitted: "There were moments of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once he did not accept Rizik, but he had the power and for his politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
But John Paul II did not, nor did his successor, Niesiołowski explained.
And then there was this fatal case of pedophilia and the church's activities, or lack thereof.
I've been thinking a little bit ahead, but I wanted to focus on the whole picture of his life.
We've known about the extent of pedophilia in the church for relatively recently.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these abominable things, says in an interview with the journalist Niesiołowski.
In the opinion of the former politician PO, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations started with the Holy Mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are writing, they have become a symbol of dictatorship  a sign of writing regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about this and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
It's a black chapter of the Polish Church, which will pay him a lot, Niesiołowski convinced.
"I hope Pope Francis will drive out Jydraszewski, Rydzik and a few others like him", he concluded.
Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary of the district
There's going to be a gala concert and a bidding war.
The jubilee gala will be held at the Hrubieszów House of Culture.
First, at 10 o'clock, the church of St. Nicholas will begin the Mass of St. Nicholas.
The official opening ceremony will be at 11:30 a.m. at the HDK.
The Hrubizhovsky Land Song and Dance Orchestra will perform.
The youth of the Stanisław Staszic ILO will present a performance called "Prubieszowski district: From here my family lives here".
Then the medals "Merit for the Grubieszów district" will be presented.
At 4 p.m. the party will move to the city square, where the concerts will be held.
They're playing disco polo bands NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and the star of the evening, Mig.
There will be auctions, including a pen and a porcelain of the President of the Council of Ministers.
The PZPN is pouring penalties for boards in stadiums.
Grif disqualified
The start in the Polish Cup between Gryfek Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk did not end tragically, when the duck fired by the Wejherow fans passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, by millimeters.
After that incident, the game was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating the case has imposed a severe punishment on Griff, excluding him from future matches.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
And fans will not be allowed in their own stadium for the next game.
They're also not allowed to travel in groups to league games until December 31.
The burdy at the stadium of Widzewa Łódź also provoked the fans of Silesia Wrocław.
However, the PZPN's judgment was more lenient, as Silesia had warned that similar incidents might occur and had alerted the relevant authorities on the matter.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the Lodz fans sector to be dumped with races, burning chairs and pushing the host sector.
The game was stopped for eight minutes, and the police had to use a water cannon.
The PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The travel ban also covers the league matches of the Ekstraklasa, but will last until December 31.
Foreign city names on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange signage across the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
The GDDK of the Reich
The implementation of the amendment of the Ministry of Infrastructure's regulation on the registration of foreign city names on road signs in Polish has started in the Podkarpa region.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, changes will be made to 94 road signs along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
We hear it's supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister for Infrastructure on specific technical conditions for road signs and road safety devices.
We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in the law we're preparing, they'll finally be on the road signs on our roads.
The introduction of the new marking starts from the subcarpal section of the A4 motorway, Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
In Podkarpa, changes will be made to 94 road signs along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
I'll give you $200,000.
The new signage will be implemented first on the A4 motorway, which is planned to be implemented by 1 November 2019.
What do you want to see in the implementation of the idea?
It'll go around without changing the plates, basically stickers.
They will replace existing place names with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line  in the first order in Polish, and then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great help for those who do not know the spelling of foreign city names in the language of the country in which they are located.

Somebody shot a swan from a windmill.
In the pond in Zamecznie in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with wings that were not working.
After catching the animal and seeing the vet, it turned out that someone had made a target out of the animal. A windmill shell was found in the animal's body.
The information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in New Sal.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was obvious that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely to avoid harming him and putting him under additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was clear that someone had made a bullet-proof shield out of him.
There were scrapings of the bolt in his body, says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation center.
He 's spending the winter at the resort .
The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, water, a safe place in the center where it will spend the winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He's not able to fly yet.
Releasing him now would mean he would most likely not survive the winter, Walasek adds.
The staff is planning to release the swan into the same pond in the spring after he's been rehabilitated.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the poor health of the animal, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The incident happened in the Castle
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish small business"
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin.
Gowin said during an interview on "Signals of the Day" on radio station Jedynka that trade is dominated by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot develop.
He said that the problem was very difficult to tackle and that the PiS government had tried to tackle it at the beginning of its term, but had been opposed by the EC.
"We won in the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will come back to this issue", he said.
He also pointed out that effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small-scale trade in Poland.
"Moreover, we will have to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Gowin.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had erred in finding that the Polish retail tax constituted unlawful public aid.
The Act on Retail Sales Tax provided for the introduction of two rates of sales tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was due to be implemented in September 2016.
In September 2016, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure against Poland.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
It then stated that the levy had been unlawfully implemented.
It also issued an injunction suspending the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels was completed.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax was suspended.
The EU court's decision in May paved the way for the tax to be reinstated, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU informed PAP that the case is currently in the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government are presenting their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and the possible trial, will be initiated.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to the verdict.
"This process takes an average of a year", said a source at the Luxembourg Tribunal.
How to dress a baby for christening?
We're pushing some practical solutions.
Baptism is an important event in the lives of infants and their parents.
Often, it is the first occasion on which the whole family gathers around a child to celebrate his coming into the world.
Little wonder, then, that newly baked mom and dad want their little one to look their best on the day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether he or she will be comfortable.
Many stores offer a variety of clothing that does not provide the child with the comfort he needs.
What, then, should we be aware of?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, babies of several weeks old were baptized in white sets and placed in the same pots or large cushions.
Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older: a few months old, a year old, or even older.
It's not hard to see why such a great consolation needs a different christening outfit.
So if your child is 3 to 4 months old on the day of his baptism, he will likely spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the arms of his parents or godparents.
The best way to deal with this is to make it into comfortable cotton sleeping quarters or suits.
Although this item of clothing is considered a daily item, it is enough to look for its festive variants, such as with a falban or a crown.
The boy's ideal body would be a print of a fly and a shovel.
For older children, you can afford more imagination in dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, plain, silk dress.
Many parents look forward to the richly decorated, velvety christening gowns with coats, belts, and hats.
Unfortunately, many manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in their products, which are simply uncomfortable for a child.
If you are looking for a suitable outfit, you might want to check out Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant cotton-lined suits.
The delicate silk skirts, satin dresses, crowns, and cute suits will make your little girl look and feel beautiful and comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, boys' parents were in fashion for adult-style suits.
Polyester jackets and pants, stiff collars, and hats often caused young ladies to loudly protest.
Today, fortunately, they've been supplanted by comfortable cotton suits.
Just look at the kits available at Asanti for Kids, which are soft sweatpants and a sweater with a waistcoat on the front.
These outfits are very festive, but they do not hinder the little one's movements as he explores the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz has published a statement of assets
Krystyna Pavlovich filed a declaration of assets at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS member has accumulated 110,000.
We'll remind you that Pavlovich has announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has a sum of 110,000.
According to the statement submitted by the Member, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4,7 thousand.
Pavlovich has an apartment worth 570 thousand zlotys and a slightly smaller one, which he rents, taking 880 zlotys per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a statement of assets.
Voting for a recess at the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, which the government requested.
The vote was 289 to 306.
The House of Commons does not normally hold meetings during party conferences, so that members do not have to withdraw from them or from parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties felt that at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the UK's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt its deliberations.
The government's motion for a recess was approved by 289 votes to 306.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The refusal to allow the break could be seen as political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was ruled by the Supreme Court as unlawful and invalid) and for refusing to apologize for it after the judges' ruling.
After this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the highlight of the day being Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
It's time to make Brexit happen.
It must be implemented to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit has to come so we can deal with the citizens' priorities, the health care, the cost of living.
Brexit must happen if we are to unite this country, Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups  Labour and the Liberal Democrats  have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for the long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders", foreign media reports.
The president's spokesman has categorically denied these reports.
"This is simply not true", Błaszki Spychalski tweeted.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, report that during a meeting with Jewish diaspora representatives at the Polish consulate in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that Israel is to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He was referring to Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that "Polish people suck anti-Semitism with their mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a man who shouted: "Polish, Polish".
The quote is not just inaccurate.
This is simply not true, Błaszki Spychalski tweeted.
He stressed that Duda never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
Spychal portal says he made it up.
According to the JI contacts, there was also a dispute during the meeting between Holocaust survivor, Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda and say that it is Israel Jews like Israel Kac who are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, he was going to interrupt Mosberg's speech.
Who is Banaas, and what has he done?
A brassiere's rented house led a journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banas's property statements.
We're just about to conclude another affair that has rocked the ruling camp.
TVN's "Supervisor" journalists revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not been registering the 400-meter-tall mansion on Krakow's Podgórze in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant was to run a sex business in the aforementioned cabin (hence renting rooms for hours).
The Commission also notes that the loan was granted to the State in the form of a loan guarantee.
The irregularities were pointed out by Bertold Kittel on the Supervisor programme.
The journalist revealed that Banas had rented the quarry to people connected to the criminal world to use as a place for erotic meetings.
The clients were supposed to be men who used the services of prostitutes.
Banaš's response to the accusations was vague and vague.
Interestingly, the pebble rental by the sutters led a reporter to discover negligence in Banas's financial statements.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
The estate of Marian Banasi and his wife is worth between 6 and 8 million zlotys.
In total, the couple can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...], writes Money.pl.
And according to the portal's analysis, the Banasia stone itself was already worth about 3 million zlotys.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an audit of the financial statements of Marian Banasi for the years 2015-2019.
Banaas announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until it was completed.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
We're not hearing from the CBA that they've expanded their investigation or accelerated their review of Marian Banas's estate statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over the state authorities and file a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...], - said MP Mariusz Witczak.
"If a normal Pole had so grossly undervalued his real estate, he would have had 10 checks, tax domicile and car-trust procedures", he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banaš is the new head of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019 for a term of six years.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and voted by the politicians of that party.
Before that, Banaś was associated with the NIK between 1992 and 2005. He worked in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first PiS governments (2005-2008), Banaś held the position of President of the Customs Service and also as Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
He was appointed as the Head of the Customs Service in 2015 and as the Head of the National Treasury Administration in 2017.
Banaś was Finance Minister for three months in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master launches a graphics card holder
Graphics cards can weigh a lot of money now, and that naturally makes room for categories of products that would have been in vain on store shelves a decade ago.
This is the solution  the handle for the ELV8 RGB graphics card  presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphics card holder model is not only a functional solution to keep the graphics card more secure without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional  decorative function.
"Republic": Ignoring the order of a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, violating a police officer's order to conduct himself is a new type of offense, punishable by fines, arrest or imprisonment.
That's what the police union wants to change.
The idea was passed to the parliamentary Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already now more than half a million cases of infringement are brought to Polish courts every year", we read.
The Republic has determined that the petition that the Independent Police Union is writing to MPs on the amendment of the offences code has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Offences Code.
It should read: Anyone who does not comply with a request or order of a public official issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law is liable to imprisonment, fine or restriction of liberty.
"Paragraph 3 of the law provides for the same punishment for those who, by failing to comply with orders, prevent or hinder the performance of official duties", says the newspaper.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposed regulation, he fears that if it is implemented, it could be used in political demonstrations.
"In the case of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and would exacerbate the situation rather than alleviate it", he added.
Statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have a positive view of police interventions in 2018 and that the police are conducting 1.5 million interventions in the city each month.
Buras is worried about Europe.
Jáchym Topol's writing is in his blood.
His ancestors include editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed alongside Václav Havel.
So from the beginning, the curse was on Jaime for the talent he was trying to use.
After eight years, he came back with "Sensitive Man".
The protagonists are Buras and Sonja with two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They're itinerant actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespearean lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who won't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys has been soundless since birth, and for the other time he has stopped in infancy.
But it's not the heroes that matter in this story.
All of them are just a backdrop to a world where there is no room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of crowded provinces, a society of old, suspicious people and wayward youth.
The sensitive man sometimes turns into a ridiculous theater.
The narrative mimics the didactics, and the dialogue of the characters creates this world.
The scene is a Europe full of anxiety about its future, but also of constant questions about its past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights because of the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although Thomas Cook's British travel agency has gone bankrupt, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is still in business.
The company is in trouble, though.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.
The Court of Ghent also declared bankrupt three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, some 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave with the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy announcement by its British parent company, which has caused concern among employees and customers.
The office was reassured that the customers who bought the tours were going on vacation.
Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-resort talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan agreed in August, the company should secure an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies normally have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems had been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for a good opinion  such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the German visitors by Görlitz.
The measures are designed to help combat the city's declining population.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful old pastel town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest salaries in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved to the west, which led to a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013, the number was 54,000.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly housing in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received.
Two thirds of these were submitted by residents of large cities.
Interest was also shown in Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States, and Great Britain.
"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz", said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not", he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant homes, and the unemployment rate is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city hopes that some will move permanently, the main aim of the program is to get the opinion of the participants.
The information gathered from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move, what their motivation was", said Robert Knippschild, who is responsible for the programme.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents by offering incentives in the form of housing.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a pay-as-you-go program that promised young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the United States.
