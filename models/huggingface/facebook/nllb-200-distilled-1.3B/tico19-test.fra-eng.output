Rapid increase in cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to prepare for a spike in COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially in intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control identified the agent responsible as a novel coronavirus now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of whom recover.
In about 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 causes more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 percent develop a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
For this study, we assessed the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compared it with the incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurovigilance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities of individual countries and WHO, daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare with the experience of Italy.
To assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8 am with data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 developments in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The development of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK was generally similar to that in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February before experiencing a sharp increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have reported a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that as of 15 March at 8am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that in Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in national public health response, potential variations in case definitions and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reports said that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, systematic collection is necessary to complement the current surveillance data which focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study in 201011 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100 000 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and intermediate care beds per 100,000 in 201011).
Modelling scenarios for care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk of &gt; 90% exceeding ICU bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
Since cases have hitherto been grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally accommodate a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be compiled at level 2 of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially in intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent CEPCM Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment to mitigation approach, as rapid and early increases in case numbers may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if nothing is implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this burgeoning research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this study will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 left a lasting impression on the Chinese people, who were forced to remain in lockdown for the duration of the Golden Week and for longer weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease is called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak started in Wuhan and quickly spread throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO considers COVID-19 to be  Public Enemy No. 1 , potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 showing the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new and growing topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also review what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronavirus are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of then-unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that healthcare workers had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under quarantine with all public transportation suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered to be the source of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, provided an updated overview of the outbreak as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 was more common in men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spreading in outbreaks, mainly in Hubei Province and outlying areas.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially up to 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass movement that occurred before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single strand of RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The envelope glycoprotein Spike (S) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98 percent genetic identity among 10 sequencing samples taken from the outbreak's origin site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, particles of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in ultrafine sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human LACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by lorf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by lorf8.
Lorf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit lIFNβ expression; however, lorf8 does not contain any known functional domains or patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. presented the cryo-ME structure of complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing clues for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The originating host and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to originate from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were proposed as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolins - a long-snouted, ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99 percent genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very poorly understood.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well possess similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
The virus induces inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) by various pathways, which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-visceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home onset, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is generally accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is compromised are at greater risk of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine to a more accurate incubation period, to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with a severe fever, even in the absence of abnormal chest X-rays, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A population study conducted in late December 2019 showed that patients had 98 percent fever, 76 percent dry cough, 55 percent dyspnea and 3 percent diarrhoea; 8 percent of patients required ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family and an outbreak following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a population study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent) and dyspnea (55 percent).
However, 80% required ventilator assistance, which is much more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with higher mortality from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
For SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) and ventilation was required for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, the SARS mortality rate in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a population study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table Table1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The outbreak often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks before the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered can be carriers of the virus again, which highlights the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4 × 109/L and a lymphocyte count of 1 × 109/L, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray anomalies are seen in most COVID-19 patients, characterized by uneven shadows on both sides or opacity of the glass at the level of the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASDS).
In ADRS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely impair the gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most alarming chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a skin flaking of the pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false-negative results, which can accelerate the outbreak, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which allows for the identification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive strip in less than one hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens proves conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been offered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2-expressing organs such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation as well as invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that an overreaction of the immune system leads to cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signaling suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroid use has not had any beneficial effects on severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, the cautious use of short courses of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was shown to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead has sent the compound to China to allow for a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, the lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancient practice.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, along with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed before this method can be proposed for large-scale use until a specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause an over-stimulation of the immune response and cause a cytokine-release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow rapidly increasing antibody production.
TCM has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, which is based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or not at all known because they are difficult to extract and verify, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission from a severe form of the disease.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rates of COVID-19 cure were seen in provinces in China that used TCM for 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei Province, which used TCM for only 30 percent of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of cure (13 percent).
However, this is a rather rough comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study that compared a treatment using Western medicine (WMD) alone with a combination treatment combining WMD and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear from symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO alone group.
More impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+TCM group than for the MO only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+TCM group than for the MO only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still to be established through controlled trials at a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a great deal of concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those who are quarantined also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, and side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric conditions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among patients about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care must be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines, with the aim of producing long-term potent neutralising antibodies and/or inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subjected to lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection are still to be determined as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably because SARS died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
However, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunized individuals is an urgent and essential goal in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any serious complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: age was the main factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this seems to be the case for COVID-19 as well.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Co-morbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to treatment and recovery.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity as well as prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), daspartate aminotransferase (AST), dalanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also play a role in prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and the time progression of clinical symptoms should be reviewed in conjunction with other elements to determine the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Because high-dose corticosteroid therapy has been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have developed avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and for a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty and death of loved ones or other patients.
Psychological support and long-term support are essential to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Based on the demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and causes few or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, newly infected or incubating individuals may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly hampers the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Considerable efforts are currently underway in China, including the containment of Wuhan and nearby cities, as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in an effort to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go away in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples from the middle nasal cavity and throat of recovered patients 2 weeks after they were discharged from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been seen in China with the gradual decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Initial forecasts suggested that Ebola would cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually die out or evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and also possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in feces, revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 healthcare professionals.
Precautions should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including healthcare professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may have been in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 (1860) respirators helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of 10 to 80 nm virions, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both are about 85 nm long.
Since particles can pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear tailored isolation jackets to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his eyes due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses when in contact with patients.
For people in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to stay isolated as much as possible and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre from the sick.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must have put China on high alert following the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public that the new virus was not highly contagious, had limited human-to-human transmission, and would not be difficult to prevent and contain.
This message caused a notable slackening, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
The Chinese disease control agencies should learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies need to (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as every word counts and can affect people's behaviour and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in containing a potential outbreak in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, as well as regularly testing and improving society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak is like a dejà vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the outbreak and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mainly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recover may be positive for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical questions remain unanswered, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originated from chiropods.
What intermediate species allowed the virus to be transmitted from the original host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long is this epidemic going to last ?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all these and many other questions.
However, no matter what the costs, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible so that we can resume our normal course of life.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunosuppressed patients have had severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Excluding super transmitters, it was estimated that each case could approximately cause two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoVs initially develop myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities seen in laboratory tests when SARS is suspected.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also become infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the nasal swab of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
HCoV-HKU1 is a global pandemic, causing moderate respiratory illness.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 are also seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs with moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this context, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the greater the number of people infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, transmission from man to man will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing a simple cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission from person to person is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier HCoV hosts.
The HCoVs are not known to be present in humans, but they are known to be present in animals.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCoV continuously and long-term.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies against SARS-CoV, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as amplifying intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats were positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Therefore, bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels are HIV-positive with specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East found in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal tract, which is also the main route of excretion for bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 associated pangolin beta-CoVs.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of HCoV-229E species-to-species transmission is less clear.
The presence of alpha-CoVs in the human genome is not known.
First, unlike alpacas, humans can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are abundant and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca-alpha-CoVs have caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of species-to-species transmission from bats to camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for decades.
It's adapted well in these camels that have moved from intermediate hosts to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through logging or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting up and eating game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be considered to be  moderate  to  high  with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It's safe to assume that it's already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs change patterns randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique  copy-selection  mechanism.
The presence of HCoVs in the human genome is also associated with increased risk of infection.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
In addition to these three viral factors, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during episodes of inter-species transmission.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been impaired.
In fact, a cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10 to 20 times higher affinity of this binding compared to that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
The HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
The HCoV-229E virus is a highly pathogenic virus and is a major cause of HCoV-229E infection.
The difference in host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, camels and rodents, could be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HCoVs emerge: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reservoirs of HCoVs.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, lORF8 was considered important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but coded for different ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, MERS-CoV outbreaks have been shown to have recombinant episodes between different lineages, which occurred in camels in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
The new HCoVs are also stimulated by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms have been detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "relectase", which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie to observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be an intermediate host or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local people.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to slaughter all camels to control MERS, as was done at wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity to spread presents itself.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches in natural zoonotic reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, we should look at how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts.
You can get respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, if you don't wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to reduce the number of children born at home.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main causes of death, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing almost 1.8 million a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor detriment, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing it to dry out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, along with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as reported.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that ordinary soaps were as effective as household antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and eliminating hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to produce a gel, or a moisturiser such as glycerin to produce a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Water-alcohol solutions kill bacteria, resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Water-alcohol solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or water-alcohol solution should be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and quick removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have soap and water on hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened with emollients and/or moisturizers.
The desiccant effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends strongly on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which decreases in effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than stop it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WMS recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Apply a generous amount of soap to the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer takes away more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinse in a pool of stagnant water can lead to re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to become re-infected. The areas most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, finger spaces and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturising lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection.
There are many economical alternatives to handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, in developing countries, water can be drained from a hanging and punched can or jug and/or ash can be used if needed.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in a public toilet is a matter of debate.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers often found in toilets.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air hand dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 percent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42 percent and on the palms by 15 percent.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution when travelling, when soap and water are not available.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that send out reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water from the forearms should not be allowed to drain to the hands.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing handwashing frequency beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to discover which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find handwashing faucets near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move up from one to the final three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji depicting handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by foul smells called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating  good handwashing techniques  have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The phrase  washing hands  refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of  purification , such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.

'cause it's the flu season
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in the genomes of viruses, most likely as a result of selection pressures, including from the host immune system.
The most common cause of deaths in this group is the loss of the entire ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
The new HCoVs are also stimulated by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms have been detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and by the low expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "relectase", which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie to observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV with 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be an intermediate host or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered by humans, either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many evidence have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by human contact with civets in markets, closing fresh produce markets and killing civets in them could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from fresh produce markets to prevent the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many pangolin beta-CoV lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans from pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs, remains to be determined in subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local people.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to slaughter all camels to control MERS, as was done at wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan would be needed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity to spread presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches in natural zoonotic reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, we should look at how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, especially domestic animals, are susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses seen in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for  suspected cases  and  confirmed cases  of COVID-19 is needed
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Rapid Recommendation Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this guideline described our experience and provided references for combating this pandemic globally.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is new, and our knowledge and knowledge are gradually improving based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this email, we responded to a comment about our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a  suspected case  and a  confirmed case  according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and understanding is slowly improving based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some contexts substantially modified.
Our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al. who put forward a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must combine one of the features of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must match three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City or surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 weeks with fever/respiratory symptoms in a classroom, home office, etc.)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with newly identified coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or change of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive or ≥ 4-fold increase in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result for the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, increasing evidence reminds us to be cautious about atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as  low risk .
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to provide their comments.
Regarding the diagnosis of  suspected cases  and  confirmed cases , we suggest that they follow and respect the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, a record daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country is now recording the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of people infected included 114 active cases and 33 recovered people, who remain confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still allowed.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days. The vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCoV infection can be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The HCoVs are also known to have intermediate reservoir hosts.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also lead to a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoVs are also known to be a major cause of infection in humans.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10 to 20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present worldwide and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in countries with temperate climates.
Stores in Australia reduce the limit quantity of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase at all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package cap.
These limits were posted in messages to the cash registers and on the channels' Facebook pages.
Buyers were apparently stockpiling due to fears of COVID-19 and the need to lock down.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, said that with the four-package restriction in place,  many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery , and called the demand  unprecedented , while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it  unexpected .
Sales have seen a "huge increase" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco in Canberra also restricted the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
It foresees higher production costs as suppliers try to meet demand and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early stock release, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish their stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to small stocks which, when exhausted, leave large empty shelf spaces, reinforcing the impression of scarcity.
 Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will likely reduce panic , Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent paper, both stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were being held because buyers were off during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the UK online supermarket Ocado was limiting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
Although the word  pandemic  refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to urge governments to take action:
 All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries screen, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
 We are deeply concerned, not only about the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction. 
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is  unprecedented .
He said in comments published by CNN in February that  apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its emergence until its continued spread worldwide. 
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, stating that  we have never witnessed a coronavirus pandemic. 
He added:  and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time. 
The new pandemic status follows the decision of the WHO in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the epidemic: "In short, it's going to get worse".
On Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4 percent in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04 percent in Algeria to 0.08 percent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from other people, and monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closing of establishments.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Fake information about the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and others from areas with high cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan and therefore the virus is thought to be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent connection to the subsequent outbreak in the fresh produce market.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case may date back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases appeared to decline in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a significant underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the UK population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed to be positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and these unrecorded infections were the source of 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were among people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official death counts related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who died as having tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who died untested - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the over-death figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged  We know that [the reported death toll] is underestimated , a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underestimation in the US. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been reported in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and most importantly health.The case-to-death ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-fatality ratio is 6.0 percent (97,039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated case-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the mortality rate (death rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease who die, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1 per cent and 0.39 per cent.
The higher value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on estimates of mortality rates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said:  Without control, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at present about when this will happen.
The chief medical advisor to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said that  this could be completed by  June  if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2  will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two .
According to a study by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary until a vaccine is available (possibly within 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said:  I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus  because it's so easily transmitted  will disappear completely  and that  it could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year .
The virulence of this return would depend on herd immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis.WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of uncertainty is the estimated proportion of COVID-19 carriers who lost their sense of smell, which was initially 30%, before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly by close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can cast droplets from a distance of 15 to 27 feet (4.5 to 8.2 meters).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be ejected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be ejected by exhaling, especially by speaking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
The postilloons can land in the mouth or nose of others sitting next to them or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to be sprayed and thus cause airborne spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While some are concerned that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is considered low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms begin, however, spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reported laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected in some countries during contact-search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, it usually infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature.Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan outbreak of acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
We think it's of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus, the Sarbecovirus subgenus (lineage B) associated with two strains derived from bats.
It is 96 percent identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequence between pangolin viruses and human viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92 percent of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, but final confirmation is by reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing PCR and scanning in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that the scanner not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first one being published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on breath samples or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
The test is usually done on a sample from the rhinopharynx, but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them have been found to be reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral glass opacities and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is currently maintaining an international online database of imaging results of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited accuracy in detecting COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scans to PCR and showed that although imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it should be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Healthcare professionals who are caring for someone who may be infected are advised to take usual precautions, contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organisations are currently working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in a number of ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62%-71% ethanol, 50%-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2%-7.5% iodised povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office building or a daycare center, all rooms such as offices, restrooms, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected post-posts when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds,  wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, which is a major source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.  The use of masks has also been recommended for those caring for someone who may have the disease.
WHO recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they face a high risk, such as if they are caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging their citizens to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical cloth masks.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without a mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed mask-wearing on everyone in public places, so that everyone can protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the mask requirement on passengers on long-distance trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a mask mandatory for all outings, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask for those who cannot afford one.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact, and keeping physical distance from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in the areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by the US government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 presence in the area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the affected areas. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the term  social distancing  with  physical distancing , to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by maintaining social ties, either virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term social distancing suggested that people should use total social isolation, rather than encouraging people to stay in touch with others through other means.Some authorities have issued guidelines for sexual health during the pandemic.
These include the recommendation to have sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or have symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed as positive for COVID-19 and those who are thought to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very high have been advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are containment or eradication, and mitigation.
Legulation is implemented in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow down the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Both mitigation and containment measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, in order to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproductive numbers to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, mask-wearing, and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures, such as closing schools and religious services; public efforts to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions, such as cleaning surfaces. More drastic measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and local quarantines, and issued travel warnings for infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who quarantined themselves, and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies.Simulations for the UK and the US show that mitigation (slowing down but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce healthcare demand by two thirds and deaths by half, but they cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), otherwise transmission will rebound rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to eradicate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications or drinking drinks, as well as resting, can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
Steroid use can make the results worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has stated that some  traditional and home remedies  can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a key response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to redeploy resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, isolating and isolating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories as to where the very first case (called patient zero) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. One theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; in other words, it may have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway junction.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States overtook China and Italy as the world's largest confirmed cases. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted travel and implemented border controls.
National responses have included curfew measures such as quarantines (also known as stay-at-home orders, house arrest or lockdown) and curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of containment, rising to 2.6 billion two days later  about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case may date back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, which she reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan were warned for  spreading rumors  about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a sweeping campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a people's war to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as  the largest quarantine in human history , a health cordon was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting approximately 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built later: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending Spring Festival holidays.
Universities and schools across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have introduced several measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transportation has been altered and China's museums have been temporarily closed.
Control of movement of people has been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of movement restriction.After the epidemic entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being imported from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.As of 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of cases transmitted within the country had been largely contained, and that the epidemic was under control in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown began.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for holders of visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy would end.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March, and provided financial stimulus plans for businesses.The State Council of Business announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on 4 April at 10 a.m., coinciding with Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to respect physical distance and prevent a recurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of causing the outbreak.
On 22 February, among 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.South Korea announced the highest alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, over 2 000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3 150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected and therefore changed.South Korea introduced what was considered the world's largest and best-organized program to test the population for the virus, and isolate all infected people as well as track and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Testing methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via a mobile app, virus testing drives delivering results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it did not quarantine entire cities.South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or praising his response.
On 23 March, South Korea recorded the lowest daily number of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that from 1 April, all people arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing for the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of concealment and hindering prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government  provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year .
On 23 January, in response to the decision by central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO Representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was certainly not a WHO recommendation, it was a very important indication of the commitment to contain the outbreak where it is most concentrated and spoke of an unprecedented event in public health history. On 30 January, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in cases in other countries, WHO declared the epidemic a US Public Health Emergency of International Concern (USPPI), the sixth such measure since the 2009 influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that USPPI was due to the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros stated:  there is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade  and  WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel .
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that  do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even though it was about to appear .
Tedros then stated that we are  as strong as our weakest link  and urged the international community to  invest today or pay more tomorrow . On 11 February, WHO established at a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the strength of the entire UN system into the response.
A UN Crisis Management Team has therefore been activated, allowing for the coordination of the entire UN response, which WHO says will allow them to  focus on the health response while other agencies can contribute their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic .
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO was deployed to China to send international experts and WHO on-site to China to support national management and assess  the severity and transmission of the disease  by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to  assess the impact of provincial and county-level response activities, including in urban and rural areas . On 25 February, WHO said that  the world should do more to prepare for a coronavirus pandemic , indicating that although it is too early to speak of a pandemic, every country should nevertheless  enter the preparation phase.
In response to the development of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had increased from high to very high, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergency Management Programme, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared , adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid  the worst .
Ryan then stated that current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, stating that such a declaration would mean that we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.
On 11 March, WHO declared that the coronavirus outbreak could be classified as a pandemic.
The Director-General stated that WHO was  extremely concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction . WHO faced significant criticism regarding its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, in particular due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition calling on WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts focused on respecting the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been removed from office following their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political officials to the epidemic in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the original idea that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that claimed that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, stating that in China censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic, which was later labeled racism by some opponents and intended to divert attention from his administration's inability to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a US government cable outlining a communications ploy apparently originating from the National Security Council, whose strategy is quoted as follows:
We are asked to try to communicate this message in every way possible, including at press conferences and television appearances.News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to gain influence globally.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and the 'policy of generosity'.
Borrell also said that  China aggressively insists that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner .
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.

This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous  senior political source  as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was  little or no use to Italy .
The source accused Russia of embarking on a charm offensive  geopolitical and diplomatic .
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that  in offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment gain speed, they will be able to return the favor if needed .
The scale of NATO's Defender 2020 military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise:  In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of US troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the people in the countries where they operate.  The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former and current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions on Iran.The epidemic has prompted calls for the US to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's  ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts  after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in two weeks quarantine at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections, and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic purchases and disruption of factory operations and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Several localities also faced panic shopping which led to the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and water bottles from shelves, leading to shortages.
The technology sector in particular has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to price increases of up to 20 times the normal price and has also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will put healthcare professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigoes to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan area, and the resulting high demand for food products, these two areas were spared severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, avoiding the severe food shortages that had been predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its high agricultural output, has not seen a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials released pork supplies to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy for food producers to stockpile for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the virus outbreak was seen as a major destabilising threat to the world economy.

The impact on the cruise industry has reached an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.

The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organisations and individuals, both employees and self-employed, globally.
Organisations in the arts and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the state) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, around the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms.Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Christian penitential period of Lent, had been cancelled.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a rise in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dating back to February (when most cases were still confined to China) described racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or were being punished justly.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese people, both online and offline, and to people in the affected areas.
As the outbreak spreads to new vulnerable countries, Italians, the first European country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been a rage on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US have reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus  Chinese virus , a term that his critics see as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and students in major Indian cities are reported to have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and  that is why God has taken revenge on them.
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, which called them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated".
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific papers on the epidemic available in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to report or people without symptoms.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from a pharyngeal swab is only reliable during the first week of illness.
Afterwards, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested in the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or sputum (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kit on 28 January 2020.
It detects the  E  gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the China National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time RT-PCR diagnostic device for the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through ReinterInternational Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests had inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck in testing at the CDC in Atlanta.As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were federal and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Samples must be collected and processed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19 infection detection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to scale up production to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that  lung X-rays are of low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive even before symptoms appear .
Typical symptoms seen on MDD include bilateral multi-lobular polished glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance,  crazy paving  and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that  MDT not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19 . In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance. Testing can be done in central laboratories (CLCs) or by point-of-care testing (PoCTs).
High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although series samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required before analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and can therefore now distribute their antibody testing.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, which are capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to test is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody testing kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has implemented a plan whereby suspected cases can stay at home,  the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube , patients spit in, return it and later receive the test result.The UK NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others while visiting a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance when using it.In the COVID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a healthcare professional takes a sample taking appropriate precautions.
The drive centres have enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screening in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had the capacity to carry out some 12,000 outpatient tests per day, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the sickness insurance if the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, test drives were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A preliminary laboratory study found that in calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analyzing samples from 64 patients at a time, grouping samples and only testing if the combined sample is positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called  Huo-Yanom (Chinese: 火眼, French:  火眼) was opened in February 2020 and can treat more than 5,000 BGI samples per day.
With its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei Province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without a liquid handling robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to consider sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing the largest proportion of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and was in the process of ramping up testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories  Huo-Yan in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to make kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the US Centres for Disease Control was not released until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the US.China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health professionals.
However, experts say that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been enhanced over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying testing programmes as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and stocks of swabs and chemical reagents have been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the testing kits developed by the CDC had  defects . The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be due to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the kits that had given incorrect results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic had given false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a high error rate and that it did not use them. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on the scheduled date of the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed the most testing, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better at detecting people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column  Positive as % of tests  depends on national testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospital will have a higher positive test percentage than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, with all other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
Regular handwashing with soap at certain "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral fecal route.
You can get respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, if you don't wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
Washing hands with soap at five key times of the day is important: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have soap or water on hand, you can wash your hands with ash.
before, during and after preparing meals;
Before and after caring for a sick person;
after changing a baby's diaper or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after chewing or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in the medical field refers to the hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to reduce the number of children born at home.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to slight improvements in growth in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50 percent.
Implementing measures to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhoea by about one third, a figure comparable to that achieved by providing clean drinking water to low-income regions.
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhea incidence by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs). It is an automatic act that must be done in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main causes of death, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing almost 1.8 million a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor detriment, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing it to dry out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Washing hands with soap at five key times of the day is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral feces: before and after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hand washing should also be done properly to prevent the transmission of disease, including before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of hand hygiene in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%), and China had the lowest rate (23%). There are now several methods to change behaviours and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a  Primary Health Care Programme  to promote the health and education of children.
Deworming twice a year, along with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To eliminate the microorganisms on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
However, a proper water flow makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still says that  liquid soap dispensers are preferable .
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended for people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms are resistant.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as reported.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that ordinary soaps were as effective as household antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and eliminating hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-water-based hand hygiene products (commonly called hydro-alcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are formulated from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to produce a gel, or a moisturiser such as glycerin to produce a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Water-alcohol solutions kill bacteria, resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 log reduction equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Water-alcohol solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or water-alcohol solution should be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The palm and back of both hands and the spaces between the fingers and nails should be held together for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
Cleaning fingertips by rubbing hands together is also recommended.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of using hydrochloric acid, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and quick removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have soap and water on hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened with emollients and/or moisturizers.
The desiccant effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydrochloric acid solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends strongly on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which decreases in effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income countries, many people cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than stop it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WMS recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent the transmission of disease by following these steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Apply a generous amount of soap to the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer takes away more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinse in a pool of stagnant water can lead to re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to become re-infected. The areas most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, finger spaces and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturising lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection.
There are many economical alternatives to handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, in developing countries, water can be drained from a hanging and punched can or jug and/or ash can be used if needed.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economical options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in a public toilet is a matter of debate.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the tissue industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London) to compare the hygiene levels of paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air-jet hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air hand dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 percent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42 percent and on the palms by 15 percent.
After hand washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76 percent on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77 percent on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the toilet at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the toilet and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows the spread of microorganisms up to a distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution when travelling, when soap and water are not available.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in medical settings became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that send out reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other between the fingers.
If there is residue under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs in water can stay on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and wipe them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid reinfecting hands when touching surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that inadequate hand hygiene remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, which facilitates the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood-related catheter infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a brochure describing the standard procedure for hand washing and rubbing in the health field.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to gather feedback from users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organisation has defined  Five indications  for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal or antimicrobial soaps) gives the hand washing agent a germ-killing effect.
It is advisable to remove these germs before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common.To "rub" your hands for surgery, you need a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine washing product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile tool to clean under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It's not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water from the forearms should not be allowed to drain to the hands.
After hand washing, dry hands with a sterile cloth and wear a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained in the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing handwashing frequency beyond 35%.
If hand washing with regular soap is compared to antibacterial soap, the rate of foodborne bacterial infections is more than three times higher. Similarly, when hand washing with alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol products in reducing the influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficile spores on hands.In order to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, provide more alcohol products and provide written and verbal reminders.
Further research is needed to discover which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health and even proper nutrition.
However, due to the lack of reliable water sources, soap or hand washing facilities at home, school and work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene practices.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find handwashing faucets near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap and raising awareness can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
For this to be successful, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective.As for promoting handwashing in schools, UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" is an example, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move up from one to the final three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to encourage behavioural change. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji depicting handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy life years gained (i.e. DALYs avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British founder of modern nursing.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by foul smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and hospital-acquired infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a key way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating  good handwashing techniques  have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The phrase  washing hands  refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
It is derived from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but the expression has become widespread in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes a compulsive hand washing to try to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience over the crimes she committed and incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after recalling or contemplating unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and place more importance on handwashing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of  purification , such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.Symbolic hand washing, which involves using water rather than soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'iism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual hand washing (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and wudhu in Islam.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
Control of COVID-19 risks in the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls at workplace refers to the implementation of workplace health and safety methodologies for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and job, based on an assessment of the risks from sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal workplace contact with the public and other employees.In this case, only basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and providing personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
LOSHA considers healthcare and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, moving to very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or handle samples from people with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to care for others or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both in terms of goods requested and the means of acquiring them (e.g. shopping outside rush hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.A plan for preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and jobs, including sources of exposure, family and community-based risk factors and individual risk factors of workers such as old age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the controls needed to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework used globally in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve insulating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on worker behaviour.
Administrative controls refer to changes in workplace policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected for the risk to the worker, properly fitted as needed (e.g. respiratory masks), worn correctly and consistently, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal workplace contact with the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and trash cans, preparing for teleworking or shift work when necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-fighting agents or other medications that treat symptoms.They also recommend flexible sick leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and informing employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), with people who are not suspected or known to have COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person recently traveled internationally to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the confinement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, the establishment of pan-screened lunches, the interception of travel to non-emergency areas that are at higher risk of COVID-19 outbreaks, and the provision of personal or business protection equipment, including a training forum for workers in the field of work, the provision of personal protective equipment and a communication platform for the protection of workers from the risk of COVID-19, and the provision of information and training on the protection of workers, including the provision of personal or public health and safety equipment, and the provision of personal protective equipment, such as a mask and protective equipment, to protect workers from the risks of exposure to COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and providing a protective mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel in case of illness as well as self-isolation and prompt notification to the onboard medical centre if a person develops a fever or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring should take place in the isolation compartment of the person.For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been in a school building, regardless of community spread.
In cases of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or canteen meals, increasing space between offices, varying arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with flu symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school holidays may be considered.For law enforcement personnel who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before reuse with a wipe or household detergent spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
LOSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposures include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high-risk workers if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or handle samples from patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough-inducing procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs at high risk of exposure include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they are at very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical checks for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples must be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separate waiting rooms be separated based on suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or higher N95 filter respirators must be used as part of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes medical adaptation, training and examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide greater protection and comfort for the worker.WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends that only screening staff at the point of entry wear a surgical mask.
For those who collect respiratory samples, care for or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, a jacket and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedures, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Because the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to people directly involved in their care, using PPE only for the specific task, continuous use of the same respiratory mask without removal for treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECT: [Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The Commission has also been consulted on the implementation of the new rules.

We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have for one another.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is to build the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organisation.
The camaraderie and kindness we've seen between all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testament to the incredible human beings we've been fortunate enough to work with.
I could not be more grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible because of your work, whether you're keeping sites up and running, paying our colleagues, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia now more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
Changes in Work and Schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
During this conversation we considered what we felt would be the appropriate response to the situation we faced and how best to ensure the viability of the organisation during this period.
We were primarily concerned with eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
Our target daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to work more normal hours, you can be useful in the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your wellbeing is our priority.
We don't monitor your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: just tell your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please notify Bryan of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management.)
The hourly staff will be fully remunerated.
We have already announced, and we reiterate, our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours of work under normal conditions.
This applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we're here for you.
Many people use work as a way to escape the stress of the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask that you contact your supervisor so that we can know what to expect and make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work which may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There's enough work for each of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We don't intend to work twice as hard to make up for lost time when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and we will try to set new targets and timetables where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, care for themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps once confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of extreme caution, we called in an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building has its own due diligence protocol which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork facility, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington DC-based staff.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's guidance.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we have also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working remotely know that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to give you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to sessions of one or two hours maximum.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them up over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making video the norm, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instantaneous conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your welfare reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about work sharing
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics guidelines based on webinars to support increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained that we understood that our cancellation requests and other restrictions might make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delay or change in these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines for Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling in the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the rest, the CRT is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite COVID-19 challenges
We'll be sending out an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll take this moment to share more updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This is a situation that affects all of us and we are here to help you in any way we can.
Until then, you can still find the information in this email, along with all other essential COVID-19 related information, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also endeavour to maintain regular communications with staff in countries currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to call and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and liaise with you if you need us.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be taken as a waiver of our work and obligations.
It is rather a matter of recognising that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These steps are what we believe are necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to give our movement the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our scheduled work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to help each other and prepare for the important work that's coming in the weeks and maybe months ahead.
We need each of you to achieve that, so you must take care of yourself and your families so that you can give the best of yourselves when the time comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face.
The following are the key elements of the project: the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
ACE2 is an enzyme bound to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the entry point into cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter collectin domain.
LACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
LACE2 is present in most organs: lACE2 is bound to the cell membrane mainly of cells in type II pulmonary alveoli, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle arterial cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II hormone.
ACE2 in turn cleaved carboxyl-terminated amino acid phenylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
LACE2 can also cleavage several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, lapelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
LACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into cells of some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicules protein S1 to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the activation of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, and inhibition of this is currently being investigated as a potential treatment, leading some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that  the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects. 
In addition,  the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those who had suffered stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) is expected to be an innovative treatment for severe lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile apps designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying people ( contacts) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those that rely on tracking the geographical location of application users, raise privacy concerns.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that supports these Bluetooth apps.
The Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities in China, while Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided as open source and will be provided to the government.North Macedonia has launched  StopKorona! , a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be rolled out in the coming weeks.Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ( StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement TraceTogether-style apps in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to introduce a geolocation app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, highlighted several possible practical problems with the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple only allows official or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the impact of coronavirus apps on mass surveillance, especially the possible dismantling of surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organisations have set out eight conditions for government projects:
supervision should be  lawful, necessary and proportionate ;
Extensions of control and supervision should include cancellation clauses;
data use should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
protections against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
 significant participation  of all  relevant stakeholders  would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups.  The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to tackle the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems based on central servers need to access personal location data; several systems have been designed to use central servers for intercommunication only, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then combined to send SMS alerts to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following major changes to privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is publicly accessible through a number of applications and websites.Countries such as Germany have considered using centralised systems to protect privacy.
Details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
Privacy-sensitive contact tracing is a well-established concept, backed by a large amount of research data as far back as 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-sensitive solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
The PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort which combines centralised and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol.The decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that personal identifiable data never leaves the device and that all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper  Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic  published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of  Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups that have come together around a common approach and basically equivalent protocols, to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would help preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing encryption.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-respecting coronavirus tracking apps
Google and Apple plan to address the adoption of the solution and the persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning (also known as re-targeting, repackaging, re-assignment or change of therapeutic indication) refers to the re-positioning of a drug approved for a different medical condition or disease from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a scientific research area currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include developing a vaccine against COVID-19 and transfusing plasma from recovering patients.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these linkage sites provides a realistic plan for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds which they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical trial.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used for some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March.On 28 March, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (USA).

The CDC has stated that the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors have recommended using this medicine  when there is no other option .
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that favipiravir is  clearly effective .
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half lumifenovir.

It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to have children.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These drugs are designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate disease and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three clinical trials underway on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients investigating the use of linoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Lumifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially re-packageable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor-antigen): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts at development are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, was expected for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic occurred worldwide in 2020, prompting significant investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative, which was set up in April, has identified the imperatives for the development of a vaccine as speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and worldwide access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the main platform undergoing Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I vaccine developer and candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I vaccine developer and candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As stated by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) have been confirmed as active and 37 others have been announced, but with little publicly available information (presumed to be in planning or design).
A phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres, and determines more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pinch vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human trials scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac  large sums of money to get exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine , which drew the protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and that human testing of its final candidate vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for COVID-19 vaccine research including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in developing a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an RNA self-amplifying vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures to COVID-19, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national vaccine bank containing several new vaccines that could be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, claiming that subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro-needles triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the immune system's production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia involves 4 170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines currently being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for implementation of Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies worldwide.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on lDNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were underway; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that a vaccine is already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread through close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced by breathing, they generally fall to the ground or surfaces rather than being a long-distance infectious risk.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although transmission is possible before symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.The standard test method uses real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they may be infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask-wearing by the general public vary, with some authorities discouraging their use, others recommending their use, and still others mandating their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to seek medical advice immediately.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected without symptoms is currently unknown and under study.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections detected that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can both carry large viral loads.
Talking out loud releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can cast droplets from a distance of 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the hallway outside patients' rooms produced positive viral RNA samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and therefore cause airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spread through feces, this risk is perceived to be low.The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, it usually infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on 99% copper.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products break down the protective lipid layer of the virus, which inactivates it and removes it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospital admission.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan outbreak of acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in lung alveolar type II cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called  spicules  (peplomeres) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial injury may also be linked to ACE-2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been associated with recruitment of lIL6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or sputum sample may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience showed an accuracy of only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first near-patient test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lobar glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms seen at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary hyperplasia, atypical extensive pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant multinucleated cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
ADD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in remission: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DIVC); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of your elbow when you don't have a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended that people cover their faces with a cloth in public places to limit transmission in cases of asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large gatherings.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak epidemic, also known as flattening the curve.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if soap and water are not available.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO proposes two local production formulas.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to kill bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not an active substance for hand sanitizer.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care which may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extramarine membrane oxygenation (EMOC) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being investigated.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be helpful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitation physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend the first-line use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in care settings where the performance of procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an airborne infection isolation unit (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne transmission precautions.The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The equipment recommended is: PPE coat, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorised the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or as a last resort, homemade masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory aid for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospital. Some evidence suggests that intubation can be prevented by using a high-flow nasal cannula or double-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both of these have the same benefits for people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the healthcare system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimise oxygen delivery and minimise the risk of ventilation-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation units.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs undergoing testing are already approved for other indications and testing is already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried on people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary approval for plasma from recovering patients as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and an ID.
The application is able to detect  close contacts  using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities.Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, an agency of the German federal government, to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not follow quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that  40 per cent of people were still on the move .
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has issued a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying,  Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and wellbeing.
The disease may be moderate in severity with few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however data are lacking for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, bleeding disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, with renal failure being seen in 4% of people in this group.
About 20 to 30 percent of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average length of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 percent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathological changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of people admitted to hospital had pre-existing conditions.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate from the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercount of moderate cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong hospital administration has observed a 20 to 30 percent decrease in respiratory capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, spread by infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency pathological codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2 240 191) as of 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region.Other measures include the CFR, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who die from the disease, and the IRF, which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 percent of the population) were confirmed as COVID-19-related.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest in men in their 50s, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this difference between the sexes are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be among the factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women and the development of comorbidities such as hypertension at a later age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not collect gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be  COVID-19 .
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus and D stands for disease, 19 being the first identification of the outbreak: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses  COVID-19 virus  and  virus responsible for COVID-19  in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as  coronavirus .
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 directive against the use of place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed a respirator valve urgently and the supplier could not supply it on time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to certain other animals.
The studies failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organisation launched the SOLIDARITY trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response in the human body in the event of a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicular S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies are expected to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on lhydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs are the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries with reports expected by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development review of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Preliminary data suggest remdesivir is effective as of March 2020.
Clinical improvements were seen in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some call for an independent analysis of the research.
The health authorities in China and Korea recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, says that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or lumifenovir for COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the serine transmembrane protease-activated primary spicular protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and lhydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Loseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was conducted.
It is currently undergoing a nationwide non-randomised Phase 2 trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments which are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CSF.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based therapy can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of recovering serum, which is made up of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
