This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already spread) and also provides other data that fossils generally don't provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists claim that the feathers of the animal were brownish on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also offers insight into how feathers evolved in birds.
As dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed canon, called a rachis, but do have other feather features (beards and barbels), researchers have deduced that the rachis probably represents a later evolution of those other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or as ornament. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and is not the feather of a young offspring.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample does show adult plumage and is not the feather of a young calf.

below these are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats in the wild) that eat much more of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the idea of the niche, a specialized job that each cat has assigned and prevents them from competing with each other.
Leos
The herds consist of one to three adult males that are related, along with up to thirty females and puppies.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act in a manner very similar to a wolf or dog suit, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not to other big cats) in their behavior and also highly lethal to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can gable (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and shoot with a force five times greater than a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's full roar, but rather a phrase with words roared in screams.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots chase and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, by sniffing where they have moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by mixing with their surroundings and then jump over their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they leave for a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it has had to be up to that point.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population starts to adapt to their new surroundings, they also start to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which we humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide which we can exhale (i.e. expel by breath).
Plant produce their food from the sun via photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants, we make our clothes with plants, we consume most of our food with plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time and he was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long beak was adorned with over 70 knife-sharp teeth, plus an extra play on the paddle of his mouth, which meant that nothing that crossed his path had any escape.
We can't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a biphid tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and he may even have been a cannibal.

Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a handful of strange or unusual feasting elements, including porridge, turkey, snails, and a type of rodent called the leirón.
Another difference was that whereas poor men and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets together where they could sit on their side while they ate.
The dining of ancient Rome could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconuts, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.

Civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through different generations, a lasting cultural remnant and a considerable dissemination.
Smaller civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and do not come to be recognized as civilizations of their own.

In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwest Taiwan, thus initiating the transformation of aboriginal grain production practices and giving employment to Chinese workers who worked on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were like originally.

For example, the most common fixed image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
still produced today, but more important is the aspect ratio that has been inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format, in fact and for greater confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.

Different common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The overly-crowded and often-ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It establishes that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came into the spotlight.
n millennia,the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.


The central authority of the church was Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this pillar was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven to be effective, by cutting off vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements over the past two decades.
UK has been planting mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering whole areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.

In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter recommending him to Charles Batchelor (manager in his last job) for Thomas Edison.
In ancient China there was a unique method for showing the different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, a bloody war broke out between different nobles who were trying to get to the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest position in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.

The same thing happened with the military, because the ranks in the army instead of being class-based, they're now caliber-based.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.

Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, while down means you should start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that the printed marks on the bow are there for a musical purpose, so they should generally be respected.

They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd who shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.

To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the Full Middle Ages, the period of European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 1000 to 1300).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by general convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.

Romantism contains an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geographic context emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of that society, turned out to be better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.

Its sound as a cradle of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.

It was around this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th or 11th and 14th centuries.

However, as a result of the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could go with a lag of between 25 and 30 years.

Subsistence farming is done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds native to that ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures group together similar-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture often make their association evident through distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, manner of acting, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate cases of boys who, because of abandonment, misfortune or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
walves or wild. Some wild boys have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these boys is due to the rejection by the parents of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that wild children experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others were supposedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived solitary away from civilization.
When raised by non-human animals, wild boars display behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that particular animal that has cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, it goes a step further.
Stadam is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The stays can be both virtual and real, i.e. the master or teacher is a form of stay, but so is the male-shaped clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual estams are built into the software and their purpose is to question, provoke and explain procedures that might be complicated for the student to face alone.
children come into foster care for a wide range of different reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affectionate and educational, but it does.
We see the non-adoption system as a safe zone for this youngster.
It is taken for granted that our non-adoption system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
adoption in foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were removed.
Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the focus on uses and gratifications.
and socialization are proposed as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech as a result of brain damage suffered, are nonetheless able to determine sincerity accurately.
even suggest that these human behavior interpretation abilities might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
segregation and recombination mix the up and down variations between both of the two stocks in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system that can be that of humans to meet its requirements for amino acids from existing plants.

The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they're cooked.

Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively silent alarm clock which helps to return to consciousness without being fully awake.

Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing you to have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force will be. Everyone has the potential to find peace and absolute satisfaction.

It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in reality, by representative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other different places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.


The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
t was also the case with the German Navy, which was using U-boats to stop the traffic.

Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them to obtain easy access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goats that were often boys or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These methods of grazing are still used today.
waggonways (horse-drawn rails) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Waggonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to drag them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads over the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.

This became a common practice, but the iron caused a stronger wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels replaced iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus (meaning standing man).
The Australopithecus, its predecessor, did not walk upright as is customary.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelanthropus already walked on two legs seven million years ago.

In many cases, it's equivalent to treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want a solution that is purely temporary, we should look at the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is more than evident that the world has changed considerably as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of the human being.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a couple of blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
That same night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlap Flyers.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.

The 25 known Dunlap flyers are the oldest copies still preserved of this document. The original manuscript document has not survived.
Different paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. They are called birds.
e many people don't consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
These birds have many features that are still very similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their backs just like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today start from manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.

The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the first to suggest that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their class, the relevance of the element of the compromised genetic material and whether the influenced cells are germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are likely to be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.

In developed countries, we rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some other more basic problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and particular vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent margins; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and an approximate mathematical representation can be made.
To get a better representation of the traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan and design the operations of traffic services.
Insects were the first to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to flee from enemies more easily and find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are devil's hornets and ephemeral insects.

This behavior often creates divisions between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams deliver the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams will be able to meet depending on different time zones, which the national management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also constitutes a unique component of virtual teams.
Invisible team is the management group to which each member is accountable.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
