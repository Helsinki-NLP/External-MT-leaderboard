Members of the Welsh assembly worried about being identified as Muppets
Several members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has given rise to the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all the different political parties have expressed concern that this measure could become a laughing stock.
A Labour Party assembly member has stated that his party was concerned that MWP  would be synonymous with Twp or Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that the whole of his party does not see it with good eyes and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member has claimed that his group was showing open to the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: The final decision on any qualifier for naming the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly full power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for Members of the Welsh Parliament or WPM, the MWP option is the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus may prove a disaster for the speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the draft law on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their nomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
Citizens will vote on Sunday whether or not to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum on the name change, and has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the struggles of Harlem churches
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner", comments Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none left, either of them.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have a different way of socializing today", he says.
Bars are no longer the kind of neighborhood lounge people used to go to regularly.
As for the churches, he worries that the money they get from selling assets won't last as long as their leaders predict - and sooner or later they'll go back to where they came from.
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he says, "and so what they're going to do is accelerate the closure of all the churches, because it's highly unlikely that most people who move into these condos will end up being members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left during the 1930's.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the wagon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the carriage as the bells of the poor people.
The expert who played the bugle in July described it differently: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carriage in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the larger carriage at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been playing out at St. Martin's over the past few months, however, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese pretended to pass on the costs to the council, although the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while hunting for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday on the first day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving for half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!'
He had his entire collarbone torn off, Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
"Because everyone was out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'", adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
At a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that a shark had been spotted in the area for a few weeks, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed by skilled employees.
These large aisles are just one part of a major investment in the UK beauty market, a market that moves around £2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and home goods sectors fall behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the trial is successful.
Investment in beauty products is a product of supermarkets' greed to take advantage of the space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's claims it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also receive more space with similar brand areas to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
Retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, while the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to compete with discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets in many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since acquiring both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to kick-start grocery sales and increase acquisition profitability.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended abruptly in disagreement over how to divide the chain's profits between the supermarkets.
This new strategy follows the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281-pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play a major role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of leather products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, comments: We have transformed the look of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've invested in specially trained workers who will be very helpful in providing counseling.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and that challenge the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones angry after Holly Willoughby backs a £11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left angry after TV presenter Holly Willoughby was made to back a £11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the Truly joint home products and accessories business.
The business of these two media personalities had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones enraged by retiring at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him big profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red-headed television star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new deals, worth £1.5 million, meant she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce her departure from Truly, Jones took a private jet en route to one of her holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at their headquarters in Marlow ready to be sold.
According to experts, the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Both couples spend vacations together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we will not comment on his business dealings".
Tough accusations... and then we fell in love
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not appropriate for a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has Trump given up so much?
Trump stated, mocking the tone of a news anchor:
I have given up nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
However, negotiations towards denuclearisation are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told United Nations General Assembly leaders on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "correspondence response" from the US to its country's early disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and the return home of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded hall, we would have about 200", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A devastated island and hundreds of deaths from tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite challenging, says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet safe for foreigners to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute in providing aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country is still unfortunately ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although there was a tsunami warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between Indonesia's vast number of islands is, at best, quite a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year laden with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced people are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the equaliser with a long throw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his side were losing 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before releasing an incredible shot to the second post.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled itself towards the right crane of the goalkeeper.
The ball finally started descending over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in a full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible, Sturridge comments to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made a move and didn't think much about it, I just played.
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue forward returned a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic before running from almost half-court and sprinting into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish in second with a left-footed shot where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, meanwhile, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency released Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings due to Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed
A murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55am with several stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; subsequently, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area who have seen or heard anything related to the crime to report to authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: While the investigation is still in its early stages, I would like to appeal to anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious, to please contact us.
I would like to make a call also to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the on-board camera of the car, to contact us, as they may have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police said they are reporting the incident to the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When she learned what had happened, she was speechless.
Residents are being warned it will be hours before they can re-enter.
You could hear a police officer telling a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps saying "It's terrible!"
At 2:00, two police vans were inside the fenced area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the cordoned area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention file 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the debate around " rewriting history "
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the Taliban's purest style of destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "craziness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor during the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to nineteenth-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A murderous pig wounds a Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources report.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a yard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is known that he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjacent pigsty.
He claimed that in the court there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg garri had fatally injured the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn and covered in blood", said the cousin, last name Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The footage recorded by the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was kept locked and isolated to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been previously reported cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife could scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't mean to hurt.
They just need to be given the respect they deserve", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains across the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had Category 1 hurricane-force winds of 138 km/h at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, US Eastern Time, and was located 620 km (300 mi) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall of about 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Rivers are likely to form, as the situation is rapidly worsening due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains can cause gorges to turn into uncontrolled rivers, and storms can bring wind gusts and dust clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to selected points along the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that total rainfall over 50 mm may occur, which could cause smaller waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated tropical rainfall waves will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
Torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October will see several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, though the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in close distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to begin October with heat over much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million viewers saw the statement by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers watched the heartwarming testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting their usual Friday programming due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers saw this testimony on Friday.
The company had an average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other networks that rebroadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people watching from his office.
Put into perspective, this is an audience similar to that of a football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the network with the highest audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million and CNN $2.52 million, according to data from Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being crushed by protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
Flake remained for several minutes with his eyes closed while being re-enacted live on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, 'You have power, whereas there are so many women who don't!
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's hearing.
Within hours, all the cable and broadcast networks were streaming live the moment the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate floor for a vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, a condition demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on top of May's on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal for the UK and EU to collect taxes on each other is totally absurd.
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU quarterback
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and claim they have found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to shooting Wayde, police said.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Criminology Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that has resulted in this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence and for seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was a 6'2" forward and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
"Things like this are what make you hurt all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected at the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several recent tremors and tremors.
Images on social media showing a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A group of separatist individuals detained by riot police began throwing eggs and powdered paint at them, causing dark clouds of dust to appear on the streets normally crowded with tourists.
Later that day, clashes occurred with police, who used their batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted Don't forget, don't forgive face to face with unionist protesters chanting Long live Spain.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this independence-minded region a year after a referendum was held on October 1 that was considered illegal by Madrid but still carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a very large majority, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by entering polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
The separatist groups camped out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities of Catalonia achieving independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck, she said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit by a narrow margin, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration in support of the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fueled by politicians on both sides.
The tension is only increasing, he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed in anticipation of trial since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after renting a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point, someone fired a crossbow at the car.
A play by Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston meant victory
Livingston, who had been promoted this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox neighbourhood club.
Dolly Menga's play made the difference, as with this win, Gary Holt's team climbs to second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side, on the other hand, are still unbeaten away from home in the Premiership this season.
But before that, the Rangers will host the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends their unbeaten streak in the league to six games, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what a loss is since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of their opportunities in front of the visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems at the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defense, but squandered his opportunity when he found himself in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out in a stretch to try to stop Craig Halkett's head pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were already fine letting the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could get the visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that's how this decisive goal came.
The referee whistled a foul against Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening towards the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could play first and finish from the centre of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but they were met with an impenetrable defense and a goalie Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The scene was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's shot and Lithgow finished off another combination play by Livingston.
The Rangers went on to hang a couple of balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected, and two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged Halkett inning of substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for a hand injury.
Livingston phenomenal: analysis of the phenomenon of the human eye
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, although much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good group of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging on to Menga throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the bright moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely failed to maintain the level.
They failed to create chances (only once they clearly outplayed the home defence), and this the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Bittersweet reception for Erdogan in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it's the city with the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, though a large number of followers gathered around to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion surrounding the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled a dictator by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies after colliding with car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy area of Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died at the scene.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said their officers are working to identify the man and report the events to his next of kin.
The road has been closed and bus routes have been diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in altercation
Six prison guards have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the prison office.
The events occurred at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at around 09:30 local time on Sunday, and still continue.
Specialised tornado agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved.
The officers had to be treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
According to a prison spokesperson: We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to look into an incident at Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees have had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible for this riot will be held accountable to the police and may spend even more time in jail.
The Long Lartin Correctional Center houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden had to be hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot police showed up at the prison to settle a serious altercation in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major flooding (dry areas could benefit)
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa makes its way through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued tornado warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make direct landfall in Phoenix on Tuesday and remain in the area through Monday night with heavy rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a pledge that only twelve tropical cyclones have maintained storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was located 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center forecast 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the Rose rain could be very good news, as the region is suffering from a severe drought.
Although the floods are a serious concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, which is causing it to lose strength.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm late afternoon or late afternoon on Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, 75 to 150 mm total rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm.
After that, Rosa will head northward across Mexico with tropical storm strength, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression strength, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main risk we expect from Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern US, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a gunshot wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have issued a call for anyone who may have any record of the events on their cell phone to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the petty anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of no-confidence in the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump declared at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in relation to his defendant.
The president said on Saturday that, that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an admirable record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually going, he said.
That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are engaging in "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place as late as Friday, an aide to Republican Party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been washed away by giant waves crashing against beaches, as a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when waves up to six meters high hit the coast toward dusk, dragging many of the people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not rush immediately, so they became victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of destroyed shops and buildings, overturned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to hit this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped among the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was coming from Donggala, Nugroho says.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
It is already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse, he says.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami coming to Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a video of an amateur shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard giving desperate cries of warning to people on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water bursts into the seashore, washing away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread power outages that have disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials say evacuees are still in desperate need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees are sheltering in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, they witnessed scenes of total destruction on the way, Doseba says.
"I was told they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's a disaster.
Although aid groups made the heartbreaking gesture to start relief efforts, some people complained that aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, supplies and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster", we can start calling for international assistance, but that level hasn't been declared yet.
As the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami burned, friends and relatives of the missing kept hoping for a miracle and for their loved ones to escape the harrowing tale of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden, he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse circulating among the parapente community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray verification mark instead of a blue double mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received", he added.
A group of thieves steal $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Last Friday morning, a group of robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to hand out more money.
While doing his job, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of distribution money.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: Being formally known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time, and used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for emotional reasons, according to the author of the program.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means one thing, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
West is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has used his surname with or without a script and in capital letters.
President AMLO of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country comes close to the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in the Tlatelolco Square that never again would military force be used to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly student grants and opening more free public universities,
has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number one AI innovator by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the world lags far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in AI, Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the US achieving the next big breakthrough in AI, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the top-ranked American player in the Othello game and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively rated previous U.S. Government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public grants, Lee said.
According to Lee, it's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's the companies.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired academic luminaries to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that US work in the field of AI could also be boosted by changes in immigration policy.
I think permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in IA, he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China awards funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other US government agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China, Lee pointed out.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
Also, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates over $100 million a year to AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been taken for months on the US legislation that would have created a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on changing the name to Republic of North Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim to its territory and has banned it from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether he will reach the minimum turnout of 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot is: Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve Macedonia's membership, one of the countries that were created in the wake of the breakup of Yugoslavia, in bodies such as the EU and NATO.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means we will all have a safer life, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will accept the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Election Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", Gjose Tanevski, 62, said in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for it to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door, Kavadarkov exposed.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO accession will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, Zaev said before depositing his ballot.
Zaev stated that a Yes would mean confirmation of our future.
In a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% declared that they would vote "Yes".
For the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, scores a goal after haggling all the defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling nullified Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He went out at speed between three Brighton defenses, wiping out whatever was coming out of his pass on the pitch.
Then Agüero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He bargained a defense before beating a few more at the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that Sterling found.
The English striker returned the ball on the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right foot hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that slid into the inside of the net from the right side.
Agüero has foot problems, City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We decided it would be between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball deep into Brighton's court and
He made a beautiful pass through the space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long bench.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before coming out of the end zone.
City play Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to get out on the pitcher's mound next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a game-leading lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to make the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wild card spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but they're still looking for their first division title.
Even if we're not playing anything, at least we can go out there and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team is probably going to be fighting for every point at the highest level, like no one else has this year.
Why would I want to miss this game?
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer pitch if that happens.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I'm not running, but I'm running, so I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible bunch of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, their meanness is evident, their malice.
They don't care who they're doing wrong, who they have to go through to get power and control.
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is "to resist and obstruct".
"And you can see that in the last four days", he rebelled, calling the Democrats "youthful, mean, dirty, and fake".
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused a loud cheer from the public.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, wait a minute... that was a really bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
He's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a string of British MPs who have been told we are not welcome, even to say what we think.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the no-confidence motion, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, these are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday nights have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that's not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if any, has long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly evident that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, because colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political vision before expected me to make a 180 degree turn and take positions I would never have taken, whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing centrist politics and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a barrage of sexist and racist attacks every day, and do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is seeing the level of abuse become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are not that diverse party anymore, and with every motion of no confidence or every change in the selection rules, the party gets narrower.
Over the last two years, I've had a lot of advice and they've told me to keep my head down, not be so expressive and everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, spurred on by the negligent Thatcher government, which left my entire classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who sponsored the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I wish to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my view, in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayrs lead the lead
Two last-minute attempts distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayres deserved victory in this vibrant match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
Ayr, the only undefeated team in the ten, are in first place in the standings.
In the end, the home team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take advantage of opportunities better, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The games we have played so far have tested us and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "Congratulations to the Ayres, they have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have".
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, given up for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just at half-time, scored and converted a try to put the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at half-time.
But the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on a stretcher, and at the dam the Ayres again extended the distance with a try from Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then, alternate captain Blair Macpherson was admonished with a yellow card and again the Melrose took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card for a goalless draw at Climo from the penalty spot, MacPherson scored a counter-runs from behind the Ayr's penetrative mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost from the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-row winger Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth try.
The star of the show Still Game seems to be about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, star of the series Still Game, seems poised to move into the hospitality industry, after it was discovered he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars in with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comedy partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the series' last, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "flourishing restaurant sector" of Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, landlocked, waiting for the court to reopen the Pacific route
The sailors patrol their ship covered in ash in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the slogan: The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty.
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as does the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, is waiting with a positive attitude for the outcome, pointed out Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICTY ruling on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign sea route for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious re-election battle next year, also has high hopes for Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that if it does, things will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The ICTY's ruling, which comes just six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea, Zárate pointed out.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any goodwill gesture by Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to have conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally swift.
Next Monday Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of differences, with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as it appears US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a pipe dream to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War can make North Korea kneel down forever.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration unless Pyongyang makes major disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, heading to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated kiss hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing that flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories, there were knitted cranes, a witch hat and even a pine cone, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strawberry masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a full scuba gear, with tubes and goggles, while another looked like a pitch-black ice cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that giant hats could be implanted on the main streets near you.
The oversized hats step on the heels of la Bomba, a straw hat, with a wide two-foot wing, that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-like label behind the impractical hat that spread through social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model who wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia saws and finished with a white leather nansa, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on main streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another string of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest standard of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for post-secondary and higher education, for careers of their choice, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you'll get into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the top A.
Data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained an upper A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more potential job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, you can always choose from a range of languages in independent schools, which have specialist language teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today's global business environment, there is no denying that languages remain vital to the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You gotta do it right.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the minutes he's going to play are still to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready", he snapped.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online at the link specified below via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been strained by sexual assault allegations he faces, while the Senate confirmation vote is expected to be held up for another week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of this rally is to help the Republicans running in the delicate November election gain momentum.
So, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at boosting volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can as we head into a busy campaign season", a Trump spokesman who declined to be identified said, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows ambition to keep hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is a sporting concept invented, which players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're in a little bit of a positive lane", Jordan Spieth declared as he left at the end of the day.
Europe obviously has an advantage, four points ahead, with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is blowing a little in their favor and have many reasons to be cheerful, largely due to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and he putted a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that won the game on the 15th hole with a similar scream, in the manner that indicates he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to do your best and worry about your own party", Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four of a kind and make no mistakes.
Moliwood were the only couple who did not bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the buzzing crowd, it reaffirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talk of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished off Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any option of getting out.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch for the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the final day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, had questioned.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after finishing Saturday's fourball and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went to great lengths to score two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and to leave their record, so far, at four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was aiming to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated a poorly-matched American team in the morning fourballs and set the series at 3-1.
The USA put up more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they had a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled in two games on Saturday, showed sporadic spurs of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, re-matched Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all in sight on a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans Saturday by scoring two points.
They secured a decisive 2-1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later won again over Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team come back from a four-point gap in individual matches, although Furyk's team, defending the title, only needed to tie to retain it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack next Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm  by any means  unless signs of confidence are appreciated
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
However, we do not observe any response consistent with the US, he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate unilateral disarmament in any way.
While Ri rebuked North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant in that he did not reject full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has communicated that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearisation must occur first and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, as well as opposing the declaration of end of war, Ri pointed out.
The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this stalemate.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he maintained last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Mr. Evil Trump dubbed Kim Rocket Man on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to do and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that and that it "doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.
The Security Council has been pushing sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and nuclear complex if the United States took "measures consistent with" that.
He said Kim had communicated to him that the "measures in line" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a class on rest habits.
This year, a new course at Harvard University allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of caffeine-fueled, all-night study.
One scholar observed that students at the world's top universities are often confused about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
And at the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me all this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
The course, first implemented this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboo and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, and the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as a person has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", noted Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the pride of staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Making sure they get enough quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in sleep mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes in his senior year during his freshman year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar program of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 home defeat at Livingston that means another knockout.
The Ibrox side were looking to add to their first home win since last February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side adrift, 8 points behind Hearts, unstoppable leaders in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climb to third position, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties afterwards, as line referee Calum Spence required medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came off the same starting eleven that tore up a point against Hearts last week, surely satisfied by the way his well-organised team smothered their rivals at every turn.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored within two minutes of the game, when Menga's first interception left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder played off and missed the big opportunity.
A blunt foul by Keaghan Jacobs hit captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a missed shot at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the third quarter.
Alfredo Morelos really thought he should have had a penalty at the fifteen-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile striker Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act at minute 34 might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it for their effort alone.
Again, the Rangers could not cope with Jacobs's hard-working play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure to pick Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted on the break to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The change had a virtually immediate impact, as the end gave Morelos a pass, despite the imposing Kelly running in the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch the visitors' attention by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one behind the other.
Holt's side could have ceded the lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to push Jacobs back before Lithgow made a detour from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a penalty shoot-out for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today -- the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has been a mainstay of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What's that over there?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "It's definitely going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
You can look at a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it back into them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize malignant cells, had her ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many cancers (HER2) and then injecting them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., "Our results suggest that we have a promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching those cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a pro-Trump rant with a MAGA hat after his performance on SNL.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was called into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After her third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again hat, she began to criticize Democrats and reiterate her support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over sexual assault allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the audience that he was not treated well backstage because of the hat he wore.
"I was threatened backstage.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I was under siege.
And then they say I'm in an inferior position", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying that he would put on Superman's cloak because then they couldn't tell him what to do.
Try to discount".
His comments drew cheers from the audience at least twice and the show's crew members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole study went completely silent".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned much of the audience with his performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West gained the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR STANDING OUT OF THE MOST".
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the now-defunct music legend Prince was renamed to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has denounced a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for portraying the role of swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male hero stereotype, saying that these roles imply that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said she believed that "something had gone wrong" and wondered how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels strongly about facing this problem.
Personally, I now wonder where we went wrong with masculinity, he says.
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He added: What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it about TV and the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this facet of manhood?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time: How do we change this?
Because something has definitely gone wrong with the young boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has provided him.
I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life going forward, he stated.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV from this cause has dropped to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
But year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relationships will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through a lack of proper sexual precautions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data on Republican senators and debunks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly released contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and that it revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, the Capitol reported.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and a lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent reports, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and pure fabrication".
Waters' statement prompted criticism online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation", wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It doesn't matter if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for any actions they have taken that have harmed any and all of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reboot of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Is this humorous self-satire about how despicable we are going to be another export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent, gummy-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license to twist it all for a second time.
Evidently, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare pretensions to liquid glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who played the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are a good moment or two on this last trip from JE.
I loved Johnny English who would get up to a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the helix leaves would stick to his helmet.
She sees Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the humor seems rather fluid and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults, and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as witty or focused as the dumb gags of the Mr. Bean character portrayed by Atkinson.
The premise that is repeatedly being made is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the UK's top-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the consternation of the duty agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a pretentious and besieged prime minister who is already suffering a total collapse from lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this callous Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't go any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that as every active spy is put in jeopardy, he will have to recover some from retirement.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some fancy institution, but teaching off-the-record classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his drought-stricken Bough, a role he reprises as Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, bound to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a miss.
So, the Batman and Robin of when things get really ugly at Her Majesty's Secret Service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous follies: disguised as waiters, setting fire to a French fast food restaurant, causing chaos by contravening on board Volta's luxury yacht and English causes a great deal of confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly taken from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all looks like a children's show.
Pretty common stuff.
As with Johnny English's other films, it has not helped to wonder if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan to make the British work four days a week and cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and get paid five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings made with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
The workers would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would be paid the same.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek has the support of the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to take advantage of the economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits into the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and into the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration collectively at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: A four-day workweek is not party policy and the party is not considering it.
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in utility companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that water companies' shareholders may not recoup all of their investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for perceived crimes.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of shares in private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean it", Kennedy said.
"I said at the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened and the allegations were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined, and confident".
But Graham's vote seems to be engraved in fire.
"I have my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see that changing anything".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City is hosting the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music event featuring an absolutely stunning lineup of stars who are on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty from the world.
In its seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteer, email a world leader, make a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just another case of what we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "shares" from its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth over USD 37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far protected funds have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and realtors, which pledges to "help children grow as fast as possible" and pledges to send $35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website that asked "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and hard road.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he supposedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market", he declared.
Zinke was addressing the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively equal.
The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels, he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost 11 billion USD and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a leverage tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said she will "think carefully" about running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would "think carefully" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to march on Washington and fix the fracture in government, for women to hold high office", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider my candidacy for president.
Warren spoke out about President Donald Trump during the town meeting and claimed that he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "it's clear we need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed wider support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially announce his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the PTSD sufferer Track Palin at the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"With what my own son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families who suffer ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers come back with", she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, a domestic violence statement and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defied the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawsuit in the case Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are coming to the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal law requires that asylum claims be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human casualties multiply in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her feverish son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no clean water".
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to pick up flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, ravaged by a 7.5-magnitude quake, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital as patients are being treated outside due to repeated heavy shaking.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right".
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with "propaganda ads".
A week after a Chinese official publication ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed the China Daily supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, on Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's campaign to increase pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports tightened.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "is redoubling harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and free press to place a paid ad in The Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions Chinese citizens may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but did not name the publication.
Republicans are pulling women voters apart ahead of the midterm elections with Kavanaugh's disaster, analysts warn.
With many of the top Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have already officially shown they want to move forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be off the charts", explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've been high; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don't vote unless they like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his claims of sexual assault on the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become a bit of a jam for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be split between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the scales tipping slightly towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is either unquestionably or likely, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh is unquestionably or likely.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or indisputably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims filed by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party while they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was "to rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates the right resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some staff developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether we need to introduce a radical change where all business models completely empty overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a Saturday post to Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Cross Victory of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial tombstone at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's awarded feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense cannon and machine gun fire".
Later he ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum courage" he made the line advance before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which makes you feel humbled.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine staying up all night watching Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San Jose card featured 13 fights, including six on the main card and was to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, UK viewers were stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset that they had stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One Twitter follower described the move to cartoons as "a sort of vomit drop".
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work", Coker said.
"But there it is six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and we cannot resolve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're gonna cut it down to five fights instead of six like we usually do, and we tried to get it back to the fans, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt inferior about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he was in high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to other people.
He also said that being a father had made it less important to him to win the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said she felt "less than" the others because "she wasn't as socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said the following: "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she spoke up because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that she wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that she had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
According to him, when you go through so much when you're young (he competed in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold", he said.
"There are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'Dad, you're not going to be in the front row,'" she said.
"As I took his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, when he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to jump in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic Games.
It also inspired the choice of her first song (Proud by Heather Small), which she had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and which still gave her goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
A worsening Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unlucky mark.
Mickelson, who will be competing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was introduced by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes events.
Instead of being the center of the action, as has been the case for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments splits his time between cheerleading and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what's wrong with him.
He's never been the most direct driver, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the deflected shots.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, will face the eventual British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points behind in starting the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role perfectly for the day, slapped me on the back and wrapped his arm around me while telling me I would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He's a hall of famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we were going to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It may mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, jokes, likes to make fun of people and is a great teammate, he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun hanging out with him this week, too, which was fun to watch.
He brings a lot more to the table than his game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon wear off
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved the win by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"And continue to remember that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a short shot", Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team's 5-3 win both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow, we have to go to every machine.
You gotta go out there and do it right.
This isn't over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do it.
I've said it before, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have on the team, but I'm also thinking about who our rivals are: the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush into this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make all the difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when everything's going well, but individual duels put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you have to give to the players, bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and bring out the best in himself too.
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the final day's ups, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the Miracle of Medinah that won Europe.
"I remember every word exactly", he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start on a high note, like we saw in Brookline and Medina.
When you have a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the lineup according to the circumstances and the best way to try and do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities", says Bjorn about his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after construction have marked the end of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the forward-thinking ships, which were predicted to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Little is known of the reasons for the return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew required for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, the ship's weight has also been found to be excessive, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if one takes into account recent warnings that indicate that Germany's naval military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, has acknowledged that the navy  is running out of ships that can be used.
The official said the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were taken out of service, but no new ones were provided as replacements.
She has regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
A new study on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
It is hoped that the discoveries may provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern and water-eared bats at Inverewe Botanic Gardens, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activity during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analysis of the recordings will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration work threatens bats, as it affects nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do paper-based mosquito nets and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bat people are not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with proper training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here in Threave, we have a large bat area", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
But we still don't know many aspects of bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before doing maintenance work on property, as the possible unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest could kill more than 400 females and young, potentially wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, harass and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to step up and help.
He stated: 'We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we do not have enough data on their population.'
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that rape allegations against him are fake news and has claimed that people want to become famous because of his name.
His lawyers are suing the German weekly Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time to keep the incident from becoming public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
What they said today, fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to be famous because of my name.
It's only natural.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order, the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable information of suspicion about private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for moral damage in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to reports filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was a 99% good boy, except for a 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but they were consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of her injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman claims she is seeking to cancel the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "always regret" losing its status as the world's leading manufacturer after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Economic Affairs Secretary.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has raised fears among other UK carmakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is done on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for automobile manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there may be border disturbances, which the industry believes could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would be halted, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are becoming very concerned about the situation: "From experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back".
A government spokesman said: We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's highly anticipated meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House statements Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Russia's ties to Trump aid and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the assistant attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller's independence has fueled rumours in Washington for months.
This month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of impeaching the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump has stated that he would "rather not" fire Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied as follows: No date has been set yet, it could be this week, although it may be delayed another week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists might disprove this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of briefings was not because he disliked the boasting of television journalists, though he said, "I won't deny they are boastful".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president does more Q&A sessions than any previous president, he said, before adding the following without citing a source: We have consulted these data.
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do this a lot in the last few weeks, and they'll replace briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press wheels are infrequent.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers from the Scottish National Health Service in the wake of Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also started preparations in case of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these are turbulent times for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to reports from Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the press that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the line of scrimmage and collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a litter and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's second-year Abercrombie's first season with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help homeless people under new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty on buying property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to lure young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and real estate speculation, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are owned by non-British residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to scale up property.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people get their first home.
She accused big builders of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable housing to correct Britain's "housing disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed housing reforms, such as rent controls and the end of "no fault" evictions.
He also wants to give more power to the city councils to build new homes.
May said: Last year I said I would devote my term to restoring the British dream: better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and make a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy a home as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the indignity of homelessness makes it all the more real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to coach Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his maximum ambition is to be the Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, currently in third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called up once as a support and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
But I grew up watching Scotland play a lot in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it's always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, though.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims he doesn't feel the pressure to be next in a list of established names in such a big team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For now, my measure of success will be whether I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I can get the club back there.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as second-team coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from a salvation fighter to Championship champions the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Probably it was a decisive moment, he recalled about accepting the position in the Alloa.
I always thought that training was the best thing I could do, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I did it right, I got away with it, and I had some pretty good high times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to overcome every week.
I still struggle with things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've felt since I was an adult.
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland, between 12:00 and 13:00, UK time.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to one study.
The summer heat wave has boosted consumption at Britain's struggling bars, but added more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and chain bars have seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption at restaurants has declined by 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin, of financial advisory firm CGA, the company that collected the data, states: "Continued sunshine hours and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance have caused July to follow a similar pattern to June, with bars up 2.8% except for restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant consumption in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by beverage consumption, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has declined.
Food bars have also been hit by the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we checked, beverage sales increased 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hotel analysts RSM, said: These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales in the external leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, more so than continued cost pressure.
This long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for foodserving shops and time will tell if the cooler temperatures we had in August will provide that much-needed breathing.
The overall increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including recently opened ones, was 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowdown in brand presentation.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in fake Insta pages
News has raised fears about posting sexual content
20% of students say they have a "main" account that they show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears about posting sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net main account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Committee of Independent Schools (HMC), has revealed that 40% of teenagers aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head, Mike Buchanan, stated the following: "It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation board at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure Scottish athletics will benefit from its inclusion in the directive, said Beattie.
Doyle stated the following: I am very keen to act as the voice of athletes and hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland.
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic medals and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's time for some agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A flyer comparing mothers to cows divides the Internet
A tire company has divided the Internet by comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the world's first silent wearable, consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a prank music video to show the freedom the new wearable gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I love myself, but you won't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not braguers, they're my boobs".
The round continues: Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, munyo the girls.
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except they are taken away from their babies a few days after giving birth, one person wrote.
The Elvie strap is discreetly hidden in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pill for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: It's an out of place ad.
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "funny".
I think that's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the pull-up made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it's got to be taken for what it is.
It's a great product, one user wrote.
Another person commented: It's a funny ad for mothers who pump up their tires (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the pull-up sticker discreetly placed on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the pad.
However, the Elvie syringe is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, stated the following: The Elvie shoe is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the audience how to use a pull-up and the challenges involved in doing so, while also demonstrating, in an entertaining and educational way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pull-up offers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie Pill has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children being held has increased even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adults living in their homes would be required to submit fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80% of people who have taken in or are living in the home of a host are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people, Albence declared.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to report to court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
All those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent runs or escape attempts, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where, because of their size, signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause them the trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country having already lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has claimed that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and the matter will be dealt with accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and without conditions, he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war on terror is virtually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced.
He has stated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we have purged all Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that conditions were good for their return and has blamed some Western countries for scattering for irrational reasons that make refugees want to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has fostered the opportunity for continued political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has remarked that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that the military action will confront the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, UN envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin to shape a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and impeachment proceedings end his presidency prematurely.
Which would, without a doubt, be the end of the most dramatic presidency in history.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and practically tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime news nights.
"People have been caught up in it because they don't understand it", says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election?
The cabbie told him he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said it was because it made him laugh", he told me, "Scovell".
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the state of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "private use" resources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (a piece of clothing as thick as his pride, headlined the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' gruesome descriptions of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that every night it gives you something new", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the character changes and plot twists of Trump's show (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're falling behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, it was about 80 degrees outside his house on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked in watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
He couldn't get away from it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows back then and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it seems they were right.

Foreign money flooding the midterm election races in the House of Representatives tightest
It's no surprise that there's a flood of cash in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that has left two incumbents vying for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburgh suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who secured the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the major party financial organizations, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly-successful special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held the seat for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, but they're lifted.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent "decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was considered, which received in 2017 an estimated US$140 million in aid for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and its high murder and unemployment death rates.
With the passing of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials made clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, diplomats say.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymity, corroborated his statements.
He studied history
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence in public records.
As far as we know, Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself holding the body accountable, just as he prepares to do so before voters, and even a jury of party members.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation lasts.
In 1938, German officials were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over tipping points like this and accelerates or delays the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing several tipping points right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a state of shock since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for the job.
Rosenstein claims the Times's information is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible sexual abuse allegations and false testimony?
And especially, will we vote in midterm for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will begin to be compromised.
But I think we won't fail, because I learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovakian deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With that baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Vienna Rapid
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at the Villas-Real this month, would put them in a good position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team, said the 31-year-old player.
We went into the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it at the end, but, overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
About Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I got and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's good and the guys are enjoying it, the training's good.
I hope we can give it our all, put the past season behind us and succeed.
Women lose sleep for fear of retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their families about it.
About half of those surveyed nationally say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't dare to ask", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We should start here.
Talk to your mate and your children. You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation - he can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a fair value that helps you cover expenses, or self-insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: avoid legal battles.
Find a representative so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals honor your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the possibility of notarizing your finances.
It is good to select a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your disability bills are paid.
Remember the small details: Imagine that an elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
The financial situation is not the only factor to be determined, but also the doctors you want to work with", said Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready".
Man shot multiple times with a shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air shotgun as he was returning home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 2.30am (UK Summer Time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger from the injuries and police have issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
As communications are cut off, relief units have been unable to obtain information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Cèlebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Cèlebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Cèlebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 a tsunami also occurred in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and causes a tsunami that devastates the southern coast and kills nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook a populated area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude-7.5 earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but over 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed over 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she reached for her phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Center, where he is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he pleaded, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor counts, which means she could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
She is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner testified that he punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media sites are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking an extraordinary death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists on his way there in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offenses could carry the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mob cases, in addition to one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police explained that he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked to have the ISIS flag unfurled in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of misconduct.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has claimed that politicians should "feel the pressure from the Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs has suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The sitting Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union Conservatives have come out in another Brexit protest in The City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
Allies insist that he will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between his package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave Solihull meeting that he wanted to undo the Chequers pledge.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out already,' she said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo the Chequers pledge".
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed minds and wants to stay is totally false".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people".
"The Chequers pledge is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win an election.
Drop the Chequers commitment and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class", he asserted.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure".
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-reliant and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners about the anti-Brexit Conservatives after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Tories for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
"This is a complete sham.
There is no option for a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign vice chairman in 2016.
He has been the center of speculation about the possibility of Trump's reelection in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An aide asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the top".
A person arrested for the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET news conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head that ultimately killed him", police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas got in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a big part in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitched early and let Hamilton run with the traffic in the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to pit and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and by the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, advancing Kimi Raikkonen and moving into fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap 44, but could not increase the pace on the following eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team did a fantastic job to have a u-two", said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "evil, cruel and liars".
"Something that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, cruel and lying people", he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, 'No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer -- did you leak the document?
No, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't filter it".
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it", he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked it in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me".
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what?
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements to their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by defeating
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat to the Belfast Giants as they won the return match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately got a two-goal lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's shots.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the bar for their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee, then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand at 3:35 of the fourth minute, from an assist by Kendall McFaull.
During this hectic early period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first break when he scored the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match late in the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many aftershocks in the area and there are many people trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his comrades escaped for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the shaky control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to ensure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"It broke our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the ruins and there are still many that have not been accessed", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a joint funeral on Sunday.
The military and some commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working around the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says now a man is missing after the crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although it previously said all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, as of Saturday afternoon, they could not find a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that as of Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane crashed into the lagoon because the runway was too short.
Some witnesses believe the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going too low.
"This was extremely positive", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a pier also helped with the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to shore before the plane sank about 100 feet into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst compiles a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors are closing the case Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to construct the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicate that they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-fashion hip-hop consciousness.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after "racist" message
A New York City nanny has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another black person", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice twice.
After realizing her pity, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African American, had done her job poorly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received her paycheck for the day and was then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is claiming compensation from the couple for the layoff and is demanding compensation of, approximately, $350 USD per day for the six-month residential job for which she had been hired, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist while claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you something I didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been angry with, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on now".
Plasco, who has likened the lawsuit to "extortion", said his wife was two months away from having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very nice attitude", added the investment banker.
The legal case is still unsolved and the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success".
She explained that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and finds that his father was very proud of him, of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son achieves something: you're proud, even if it's not your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called often to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect her to get over it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given him to keep his body from bleeding were being consumed and were leaving his system.
He had died earlier than planned, so everything was off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and other people.
I had to keep my form".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience.
"No one knew", he said.
"I was upside down and tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
The feeling that she needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much".
Mourning women hang suicide cards on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging up postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for citizens to call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said her smile could light up any room".
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a "very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis stated: "I am continually concerned about a side effect".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people they can turn to, that they can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there and be silent. You have to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he was sick or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
It hit rock bottom on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be destroyed by the supporters' entrenched deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance is about timing.
With only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans don't get a good result, they'll be weak in getting the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to back Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to undo the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "falls" with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 defections had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Sources in Seoul say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysteric" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Superior Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysteric" and that his temperament makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have called her a 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in reference to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the accusations of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes shouting and speechless as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" staged by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if she would seek to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House.
"This is what I can say: If you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only are you not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but you're not qualified to be on the court where you are now", Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Superior Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into the courtroom and expect us to think it's wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified rant: months and years of abundant rage and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. How about you?"
She continued... "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that was, when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person I was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off".
And then it went on.
I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they're basically misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once ended up crying in indescribable rage, is of an older woman (a cold-hearted executive who had always scared me a little) grabbing me by the chest and dragging me to the eye of the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll have you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself as a presidential candidate.
"It was a poorly thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Some called it "Whitey and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because she was late to the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million USD.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who were giving $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty in raising money and targeting voters, instead of delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was speechless.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
"You would have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my grave?
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the war does not look likely to end anytime soon, a distancing of the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on China's major exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth $200 billion, which impose taxes on half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way each time, and recently raised tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has committed to replicating the US and the world's second largest economy is not likely to back down anytime soon.
To make Washington back down means to give in to some demands, but to publicly bow to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a collapse in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted", says Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that funded the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought through most of the tournament, threw the exit punch into the water at the par 3 16 hole, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his series and became one of only four players to achieve 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off with a 5&4 by the less qualified European player Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have my cup back.
The team is the most important thing... and I am glad I was able to help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay to fellow American John Ram, who defeated North American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches he had in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistic for one of the greatest players to ever play the game, with 14 major titles to his name, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Their 12 players have played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
You're in for a hat trick.
We have been defeated".
Red tide update: concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more dispersed proliferation conditions are being reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier areas, suggesting a lower concentration.
The red tide proliferation extends along approximately 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are spots 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
There have been reports of moderate coastal or offshore concentrations in Pinellas County over the past week, low to high coastal concentrations in Hillsborough County, deep or high concentrations in Manatee County, medium deep or offshore concentrations in Charlotte County, deep or offshore concentrations in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritations are still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported over the past week in northeast Florida.
