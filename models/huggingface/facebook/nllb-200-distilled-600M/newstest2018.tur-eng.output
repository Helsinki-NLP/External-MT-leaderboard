Last minute: our cosmic visitor is the giant asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps more, of giant asteroids in the solar system that can go loose and cause serious consequences when they hit.
These objects, which may have closed or open orbits left over from the formation of the Sun, sometimes pass through Earth.
The 650-meter-wide asteroid will pass through the Earth's closest location at 2.24pm today, at a distance of 1.75 million kilometres.
We've heard more and more of these kinds of stories every day.
The main reason for this is the advances in observation techniques and observation tools.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that we couldn't identify before.
For example, in January last year, an asteroid the size of a bus passed just half the distance between Earth and the Moon.
And even more interestingly, the asteroid was only detected a few days before the transit.
So there could be other space buses coming at us right now.
Imagine what you would do if you were told that an asteroid 20 meters across would crash right in the middle of your neighborhood.
Asteroids of this size won't actually destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow up the windows of all buildings.
This will be due to shock waves from the asteroid that will inflate into the atmosphere.
For example, an asteroid that hit Russia in 2013 was of this size and could shatter the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you're in a neighborhood that's 100 meters wide, if you're in a neighborhood that's 100 meters wide, you should go at least 50 kilometers beyond your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size and angle of impact of the asteroid are factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage caused by the impact.
Let's look at a few scenarios from the European Space Agency's simulation.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 meters hits Earth at a 45-degree angle at a speed of 60 kilometers per second, it will form a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a crest of 1,200 meters.
A hit on the Richter scale is equivalent to a six-magnitude earthquake, and even if you're 10 kilometers away from the impact point, your body will burn to a third degree.
And those who are 50 kilometers away will be waiting for broken windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, the situation becomes even more dark.
If such an asteroid hits Earth at the same angle and velocity, it will form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers across.
So it's a big neighborhood that turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you're 100 kilometers away from the impact point, the heat from the impact causes a third degree burn in your body.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8.
The damage the asteroid will cause depends not only on the asteroid's chemical composition but also on the rock structure of the area it will hit.
The above values are in reference to a scenario that would occur if an asteroid, like a hard rock, crashed into a region of rough rock.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, it would have a three-fold crater size and a disaster like that would have been multiplied if it had fallen on a surface formed by the cooling of the lava.
And 66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were hit by an asteroid about 10 kilometers across.
The asteroid impact killed 75% of all sea and land creatures instantly.
If such a large asteroid destroying dinosaurs has targeted Earth, the surest option would be to leave the planet.
Tons of matter are dropping from space to Earth every day.
Most of it burns to ashes in the atmosphere.
Some meteorites, large enough, burn up in the atmosphere, causing glowing phenomena known as star sliding among the public.
Let's end this summer with another piece of inner-sounding news.
Studies show that over the next 300 to 400 years, a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth causing very serious destruction.
As creatures living for an average of 70 years, I'm sure you're all a little relieved.
Flash claim for the medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is keen to see the Black-White name on the agenda of the Stoper area, leaving Inter...
The 30-year-old, who took a leave of absence after wearing a Confederations Cup uniform in Chile and recently resumed his work with Inter, is awaiting offers.
In the prestigious Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, Beşiktaş suggested that he offered Inter 10 million euros for Medel, who could take up positions in both the stoper and front liber region.
The black-white candidates who offered the medal were expected to receive a response from both sides, while the Chilean footballer was warmly awaiting to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, it's hard for Black Eagle, which has an FFP restriction, to pay a price like 10 million euros for the Medal.
The Black-Whites are likely to join the star player in the event of a serious discount on their bonus service or they head to Medel by hiring, as they did in the first Caner Free transfer.
Petit-grandfather Negredo has reported his transfer to the stock exchange
Human rights group issued travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color to travel to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racial slurs.
The group's statement reads: "The Missouri State NAACP Travel Advisory Notice, effective August 28, 2017, exempts African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians from special care and extreme caution when traveling from the beginning to the end of the state, as stated there, due to the recent suspicious, racially based incidents occurring throughout the state".
The NAACP said a new Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, while the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeted minorities, was effective in issuing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They're being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
"We're hearing complaints at a rate we've never heard before".
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group exemplified the racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was arrested earlier this year by Missouri police after running out of fuel while crossing the state and died under suspicious circumstances.
The advisory also highlights a new report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that shows black drivers are 75 percent more likely than whites to be stopped in the state.
"The advisory is to alert people to the possibility of their families, friends and coworkers in Missouri".
"People must be prepared to bring bail money with them, to inform their relatives they're going through this state".
In Missouri, the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program show 100 hate crimes committed in 2015, ranking the state 16th in the nation for similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a business to sue for discrimination when renting or working.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) previously issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after local law enforcement authorities in those states passed immigration enforcement laws ordering people to be arrested for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will increase racial practices.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, advocacy groups have been using the practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba is in Beşiktaş.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for €13 million two seasons ago and was loaned to the Black-Whites in the middle of last season, returns to Beşiktaş in cash.
Last week, Black Eagle asked the Senegalese player for a detailed health report, but the report from the star football player prompted action.
The black and white management, which has begun work on a 32-year-old player whose Chinese representative had not considered for the squad for next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who is not listed because of his foreign status in China, has informed the administration that he wants to return to the Black-White.
The Chinese team has approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days to sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated on in Trabzonspor
In a statement on the Bordo-blue club's website, Castillo's left knee arthroscopic meniscus surgery at Istanbul Liv Hospital was noted, stating, "Our player is expected to start training with the team within 4 weeks after the operation performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar".
Castillo suffered a right back injury in the preparation match against the Netherlands team Heerenveen in the Bordeaux-blue team's Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was told he would be away from the field for three to four weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to undergo surgery due to his previous meniscus problem.
The referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at a memorial ceremony in Duhok on the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization ISIS's attack on the Yazidi in the Sinjar province of Mosul.
Referring to the independence referendum that the ICBY wants to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say this with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a fair and decent country".
We tried every way with Iraq, but we were completely desperate and hopeless.
Our past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this point, and there is no guarantee that we can take away our rights and protect them.
So, to ensure life and security together, we must show the world that we can all decide our fate through a referendum.
I must also point out that the referendum is not an end for us but a means to achieve a greater goal.
Recalling that the central Iraqi government had made many promises to the Kurds since the 2003 fall of the Ba'ath regime, Barzani said that the disaster in Singapore had occurred shortly after the fight with ISIS and that a direct referendum decision had been taken.
Explaining that the people of the ICBY want to decide their fate peacefully and democratically for their self-protection and development, Barzani said, "It has become clear that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us as a state".
"He doesn't want us to move forward".
Barzani, who reacted to the fact that the central Iraqi government did not give them weapons during the fight against the terrorist organization ISIS, but that within a short time, the Hashdi Shabi, established by a fatwa, was immediately legalized and all weapons were provided, noted:
The Peshmerga have not been contacted within Iraq's defense system.
The central government did not give the Peshmerge what it offered to Hashdi Shabi.
The Peshmerge is constitutionally recognized as part of Iraq's defense system.
But when Hashdi Shabi was not present in the constitution, all possibilities were mobilized in violation of the laws.
We're not saying we're against Hasdi Shabi.
The Peshmerga and the Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, but why on the one hand, while the Hašdi Shabi is legalized, the existence of the Peshmerga and the fight against terrorism are covered up.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
The terrorist organization Daesh carried out an attack on the Yazidi in Sinjar province of Mosul on 3 August 2014 that killed many people, including women and children.
He came back from the tragedy in 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, Air France's Boeing 777 passenger plane was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan when North Korea's missile was in the air.
Officials who recorded the missile landing at the area where the plane was 10 minutes ago said it was estimated to have approached the plane within 100-150 kilometers.
Air France said the missile did not intersect with the plane's route and that there was no problem with the flight.
The statement read: "The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile landed in the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's path".
Nothing is sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most defining sign of regime change is that they're starting to attack the statues.
The Americans know the power of this as much as anyone, like the 2003 overthrow of the carefully-convicted Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square...
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key theorists, knew exactly what he was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate between CNN's Jim Acosta and the president over proposals to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he did, a full boat tour owner and Freedom Simulator would lynch him.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, when Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the base of the monument.
Miller, speaking to Acosta, said, "I don't want to talk about history here from beginning to end, but the Statue of Liberty is a light-filled symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mentioned was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's actually right, but as he himself says, this isn't really about history.
This is about the contemporary echo of Lazarus's terrifying words, in which a state seems to invite not only some elderly immigrants but the poor and the poor: "Tired, poor, / The crowds in the closet yearning for a breath of freedom, / The wretched unwantedness of the closeted darkness".
Never before has the "unwanted ending" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not bringing literary criticism; he was explaining that these people were not welcome in the United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: It's actually a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his companions, who campaigned to put his words at the base of the statue after his death, knew well that they were engaged in a highly political action.
The statue was intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism by representing Liberty in a figurative form with the coming of the woman in the body.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the poem: the female figure was no longer abstract, it had a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The poem's image and marriage is a genius feminist coup and a devastating attack on American immigration.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, so have the right-handers long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a great John Baptist-style philanthropist for Trump's rise, argued in 2010 that Freedom did not invite anyone in, but rather was an early neocon holding American fire to a world in darkness: "Miss Freedom is coming out.
It's there to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States".
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was entirely about the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great creative act was to see it as seen by the weary, desperate but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often terrible journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for shelter and wanting to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective that Miller and Trump would find right in any way.
Their torch is not to guide but to dispel their only source of power, hatred.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots were allowed to make the British team.
Neil Black, UK's athletics performance director, says the 16-man Scottish squad in the World Cup squad will "contribute a huge amount" to the team.
The record-setting Scottish athlete has been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that the UK athletics should learn from it.
Black said, "We're going to adopt it, and we're going to try to understand it, and we're going to try to get out of it".
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they're doing.
British athleticism: They think it's about what they do.
So is the guy on the corner.
Whatever the combination of the conditions, it's absolutely great".
Many Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain by the crew.
"Eilidh is a little humble.
"That was a great captain speech", says Black.
"Whether they are in Scotland or wherever they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and true feeling that Eilidh naturally embodied was wonderful".
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall athlete finish at previous world championships was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, Muir, a middle distance runner, broke five British and two European records.
He's going to be in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another Scottish to watch is Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including the British team trials and victories at the New Year's Games, running the 1500m.
Doyle remembers the first championship in which the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move because many of his sisters will not only join the team but will in some cases compete for a medal and fight to make it to the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was voted on by the other team members, so it was already a huge honour, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me".
"I'm proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here, as proven athletes, as athletes who watch to get on the podium.
What about the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I'm taking advantage of the fact that we're so lucky in this situation, in that we have a World Championship at home.
So, this is really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this infield support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium to succeed.
I get a second chance to go out there and fight, and it's going to be such a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't take away voter criticism, don't run for public office
Our father had some knowledge about negative press coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers began to criticize him severely about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was upset by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be driven to the brink stupidly and quietly".
That brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the case as unimportant, and online comments were filled with "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook".
But it's important.
That's especially important when you're like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state where the majority are Democrats.
He has the second highest grading rate among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a crazy firecracker.
He excelled in leading his state and being strictly committed to principles.
With her humorously portraying her hairless post-chemotherapy head, she was also quite adept at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with her constituents.
So blocking people from coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, officially classified and run by staff members who pay the tax dollars of the people, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's executions, claiming that blocking comments was more than regulating them.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hateful people making online verbal attacks.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people talking to their elected leaders -- a teacher, a business owner, and a priest -- not trolls.
All of her comments were not respectful, thoughtful, or blasphemous.
The priest quoted from the Bible, referring to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Maryland Bowie lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, not full of hate, but asked questions about hate crimes.
He wrote in the comment section of The Post's news: "I have kindly commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news".
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same topic, some people ignore my word as a collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "compounded spam attack" will likely be called a "defence of opinion".
The Facebook era makes it easy to make a message relevant by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or when protesters had to be arrested and silenced.
But, digital as it is, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be a reference in the future on this issue came from Virginia last week.
According to U.S. District Judge James Cacheris, the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when he banned a voter on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the post-expensive era had a very similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers undermined his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unnamed trolls.
People who used nicknames like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that were in violation of Washington's decisions.
The online George Washington Articles Project, which collects historical documents, has suppressed the petition office, criticizing its stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Maritime Affairs with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, opposition and debate are at the heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable at his Renaissance Club.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at home in the next three days when the Renaissance Club in South Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who finished as the next door leader at Archerfield Links before losing to Paul Eales, feels a commitment to the new venue and acts as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club build, and we see it rise to glory with this organization", said Rafferty.
The players will see the field at its best, in a state of extraordinary condition.
Jerry did a great job of building this place.
He's a tireless advocate of this game and proud of his success here.
It's a great show for this field".
Although England's Eales won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will be fighting to defend a championship for the first time in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special", said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't have a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because the year after I won it was removed from the calendar.
It's nice to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come alive, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a very special time and we will always remember it with love".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, is making a comeback on his own.
This will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, "It always makes a little bit more sense when you're struggling inside".
"You want to do well, but you feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and playing basic golf.
I'm happy to go so far".
The three players in the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free and parking is available; £5 per car with one person and £10 per car with two or more people.

I found the answer.
Think of a "seat" that... has a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, more than the budget allocated to each of the 11 ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science and Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism!
The staff is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Chairman of Dianet Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about Mehmet Görmez, the head of Diyanet Affairs!
For days, I've been searching for answers to my own questions.
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez was taken from his seat...
I've read every article about his posting.
No, I'm not.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez prepared the Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Diyanet Affairs (DIB) for 2017-2021.
President Erdoğan has taken out a million-lilar S600 Mercedes.
So he had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Six years of service is not enough".
The first DIB President M. Rıfat Börekçi served for 17 years.
As you all know, Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz sat in that chair for 11 years.
I mean, the president's term is up.
I repeat, why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
The job is done...
Shiite proximity
A source close to the government said: "According to the traditional legend, Mehmet Dönmez's people did not have circumcision".
The code of this sentence is: He didn't have circumcision!
The person who used this phrase stuck it behind him: "The modernist was found by the traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Görmez was seen as innovative.
What do you mean, innovative?
The answer to the problem was hidden by Mehmet Görmez on a foreign trip.
Date of release: 27 December 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference in Tehran, which aims to bring Islam closer together.
He met with the religious leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
He prayed with the Shi'a in line.
And at the conference, he said, "The Evangelical schools are the human schools that have evolved over time, representing different ideas and beliefs in understanding Islam".
All of them are for the purpose of determining the direction of God.
Each one is on the same path, but they will all come to the same destination.
It is never acceptable to identify the mosque with religion or to see sectarianism above Islam.
The prejudice, the discrimination and the conflict is a reflection of oppression and ignorance.
When the sect has taken the lead over religion, the religion itself has suffered the most...
I want to emphasize again, by highlighting here:
Shiites and Sunnis are one nation...
"No one can blame another for not perceiving Islam as he understands it".
A year later...
Only the leader of the Caferi party, Selahattin Özgündüz, from Turkey, attended the 30th Meeting of the Union.
I mean, I...
Not circumcision , but kindness
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional ulema".
The next Tehran conference was attended by no one representing the Turkish State.
Mehmet Görmez has not been invited four times since he took office.
The reason was obvious; the Shia-Iranian anti-Islamic "traditional ulema" in the DIB!
In 2016, Mehmet Görmez's chair began to be dismantled immediately after his visit to Iran.
At the beginning of this, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurulmuş was in charge of the DIB!
Mehmet Görmez was so choked that he asked "to be attached to the DIB presidency".
The point is...
There was a difference in the state's view of circumcision.
Theoretical worlds, like the "traditional ulema" created in the madrassas of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were equating Sunniism - in the shadow of the US - with Wahhabi-Selefiism!
These were Iranian opponents who were not even tolerant of the Tehran trip.
It was not surprising that Ahmed of Cuban said about Mehmet Görmez: "Dianet was not in danger from this".
"My Lord, make for a good leader, loyal to your people and faithful to the uncircumcised".
They used "immorality" as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
Once the FETO-backed CIA-backed Iranian opposition now runs under new names.
And with the FETÖ compasses...
A photo of a young man holding a whisky was leaked to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet Görmez"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who has made Mehmet Görmez the biggest opposition in the media: Turkey, the US-led newspaper of the Illuminati Community!
After all...
- Who resisted bringing her heresy to the Saudi Wahhabi-Selefi line...
- That doesn't spark a cult...
A clergyman whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
US cultural imperialism is continuing to rapidly Arabism Turkey.
You can have no doubt that the next Dianet Affairs Chairman will be the Wahhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the preservation of Turkey's sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu visited China for an official visit.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a joint press conference with Sergeant Shoveshoğlu at the State House in Beijing.
Vang said: "We hope that Turkey will become more active in international affairs".
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey", he said.
Sergeant Agoglu said that "Turkey, in its search for close cooperation with regional and international organizations, international organizations are not alternatives to each other, but complementary".
The spiritual officially begins its second period
The presidency of Hasan Ruhani, who won the presidential elections in Iran in May, was confirmed by the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took the oath at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
The ceremony was attended by high-level military and political figures as well as foreign representatives, and was attended by Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran, Rıza Hakan Tekin.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for four more years, will officially take office after the swearing-in ceremony in parliament on Saturday, August 5.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekçi, representing Turkey.
The security measures at the Cilvegözü border gate
The transportation of goods other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials will not be allowed from the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanlı district of Hatay.
According to information received, the Babel Air Border Gate near the Turkish border and the Cilvegözü Border Gate were closed to transportation except humanitarian aid, food, medicines and cleaning materials due to adverse security conditions in the area.
And the helpmen are allowed out of the Silk Road Border Gate.
No information was provided on how long the restrictions would last.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove when she cooks.
He seldom even uses a pot.
The housewife places a sweet potato, commonly known locally as "note", directly on the fire in a wooden house in Enarotali, in the troubled region of Papua, Indonesia, near Paniai.
After half an hour, the burnt punch is taken and the appetite is wiped and wiped, hands unwashed.
Degei lives on a muddy floor where he does some laundry, like washing clothes with the cloudy water from the nearby swamp, and he has no furniture.
A bucket in a roofless house is a deserted mission.
The youngest of his husband's four wives, he was never assigned to any field.
It's not uncommon here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and many drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5 p.m"., he says.
A rare snapshot of everyday life in the mountainous areas of Papua, an old Dutch colony that Indonesia absorbed in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 people were forced to vote by force before the union's occupation.
An existing movement that was propagandising independence against the Dutch government quickly turned its anger towards the Jakarta government, which maintained tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or law enforcement organizations.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enaratali is as remote as it is deserted; the trip here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour drive with a rental car.
There's no public transportation.
The town of 19,000 people contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with rusted iron roofs turned into various orange-brown tones by rust.
Let go of the journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, the Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There's been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", she says, referring to her brightly colored, hand-topped bra, dark shirt, and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies".
Papua, the poorest region in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its population living below the poverty line and the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region the size of New Jersey that is home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has reserves of about $78 billion of timber.
However, these riches, a source of misery for the Papuan people, keep Indonesia's powerful army alive.
A 2005 New York Times study reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
The Papuans' call for more autonomy threatens this golden-egged chicken and ruthlessly strips it of its rights.
According to their advocates, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuan have been killed by the Indonesian army, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
The mass killings in the mountainous areas of Papua in the 1970s have reached genocide levels, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The Archdiocese of Brisbane's 2016 report "We'll Lose Everything" includes testimonies from the audience, including the previous year's unlawful executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are especially popular), and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because there are events every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher with the Human Rights Watch.
Pressures were increased as Papua's resources brought in settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The region's 3.5 million people are 83 percent Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's densely populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic purposes.
Javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado served with fried chicken and peanut sauce mixed with vegetables.
The locals are having a tough time competing.
"Migrants sell chicken and vegetables at traditional markets for less than the indigenous Papuan people", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Paniai who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for work.
"This has caused the indigenous Papuan people, the Papuan mam-mam (women) to lose the market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, pledged to resolve inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter took 27 of Papua's 29 regions, including Panaia, as he made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi with the expectation that justice will restore our hope", You says.
In fact, Paniai experienced its worst case only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, two Indonesian military darkness broke out on a motorcycle while a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs outside a party fire in Enarotali.
The scared kids told them to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers became angry with their style and, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai, later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said they chased a group of drunk soldiers and beat them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired on the boy group.
One of the boys, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he went into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, the events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and danced the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in the form of a ring and imitating the song of the bird).
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military garrisons.
As nerves tightened, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio to "shoot them if the crowd resist more than three times".
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was going to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", she told TIME.
The ship still doesn 't know who fired the bullet , but it says it came from a collected military weapon .
"It was crowded, shot many times", he adds.
According to his cousin who witnessed the attacks, the native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to see if he was", said John, who is known by only one name, as many Indonesians are.
"I saw him die... and kissed him".
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only "saved" the police station because it was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Branch Director Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015, "When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves".
"It's a matter of survival".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech three weeks later in Jayapura, saying he shared the grief of the victims' families and promised to solve the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so that it doesn't happen again".
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said he had established a non-judicial mechanism for historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations were long ago.
Some in the '90s, some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes we have to go through".
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto stepped back, saying there were no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's all going to be settled by law".
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" involving more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims have responded with bitter suspicion to such claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the past three years, but I have not made any progress", says Johanna.
"I'm tired of it".
Years later, he says he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldiers, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus echoes the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping bury four of his victims.
"After I buried the bones, the soldier came looking for me", he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired on the villagers in the neighboring town of Deiyai.
During a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take an uninhabited man to hospital, one person was killed, including 17 children, and wounded.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded by firing a warning shot.
But the indigenous people say that the mob (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge", says Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the raising of the wounded.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The Deiyai parliament has called for the arrest of the officers involved and the withdrawal of the active police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is fueling the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live scattered throughout the green mountain centre of Papua.
Many joined the rebel army Movement for Free Papua (OPM), which claims to protect the rights of the Papuan people by carrying out random attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and detained arbitrarily by the military under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty" in recent years.
Some of them never see again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty is a source of dissatisfaction.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for the natives to buy.
Bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly nuts, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women who can grow four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the crop for the family, and sell the rest in the local market.
Ten notes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous Papuan people and new immigrants who have arrived in greater numbers have increased since new air routes to Nabire Airport were opened.
The jobs that are few are usually left to the more educated and wealthy immigrants.
It is rare for Papuan people to have the capital or skills to run their own business competitively.
John Gobai, president of the Panai Tribal Council, says, "Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no job or money here".
Tecrit keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
Moreover, the restrictions on journalism for international media are strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant agencies", despite the rare permission to shoot videos.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch Asia Organization, Jokowi's promises to lift the restrictions on news and developments to increase transparency of his election campaign were not fulfilled.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces: visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "the various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's claims, telling journalists in Jakarta, "Indonesia still has a democratic system and free media, so it's hard to cover up evidence in human rights cases".
The locals want more foreign governments to take care of them.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4 under the chairmanship of the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, the local people broke their silence with pleas for "freedom we want", according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan people say it is unlikely they will vote for Jokowi again.
"The Jokowi is a man with good intentions but surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai attack", says Gobai, the head of the tribal council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that they are in need of poor education and health care, besides living under the impending threat of a violent soldier.
Gobai says that like other Papuan people, the people of Paniai see their votes as a "debt" they give Jokowi to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic act of resistance: burying the body of one of the victims on land directly across from the police and military headquarters.
They will at least make sure those responsible remember their crimes, knowing that justice can never be done.
"A member of our family was killed", says Yacobus, his head bent forward.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Mashal' skyscraper for second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday ravaged the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-long 79-story building.
This is the second major fire in two years to spread rapidly to a high-rise building called the Lighthouse Tower.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported, and no explanation has been made as to the cause of the major fire.
"We were asleep and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor", a quiet man named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the massive fire around 4am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has said it is trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the fire department in 2015 found that most of the damage was on the exterior panels used for coating, i.e. decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation and covering panel system on the Grenfell Tower in London, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.
Good news for more than 4,000 chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policy will launch a social assistance program for poor citizens and their families struggling with chronic diseases, in the first phase, 4,300 patients with tuberculosis and SSPE will benefit.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support to patients over two thirds of the minimum wage, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information, details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" which was launched recently under the direction of the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya have been revealed.
The social assistance programme, launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens struggling with chronic diseases and experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, is also a world first in many respects.
The Ministry, which has completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the programme, will provide not only cash but also regular psychosocial support to families through the social assistance program.
The aim is to ensure that the poor citizens and their families who have a chronic illness and are continuing their treatment at home are not left alone, both materially and spiritually.
According to the studies, in the first phase, poor citizens struggling with tuberculosis and Subcutaneous Sclerosis Panensephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by the measles microbiome, will be given regular psychosocial and cash support under the new social assistance program.
In the later stages of the programme, the aid programme will cover poor citizens who are struggling with other rare and risky diseases.
In addition to the support planned to be paid at a rate of more than two thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may be made to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical care, who are bedridden or who have been diagnosed with tuberculosis by a health unit with a need to improve their home living conditions.
In order to benefit from the support, the minimum monthly income per household is required to be less than two thirds of the monthly net wage.
The health board report of SSPE patients is also required to be prepared in accordance with the methods and principles set out in the "Regulation on the Measurement of Immunity, Classification and Health Board Reports to Expats".
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 U.S. passengers bring illegal items on board
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled banned substances into the plane from U.S. Department of Transportation Security checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who unknowingly carried a banned knife or other sharp object.
Less than 1 percent later claimed to have noticed that they had accidentally travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people by the jet charter service Stratos Jet Charters found that younger passengers were also more likely to break the rules.
Among those who admitted to deliberately trying to fly something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Y-Generals, yet fewer than 15 were X-Generals.
The most common items that are deliberately stolen from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly passing safety-savvy devices, while 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants admitted knowingly carrying illicit drugs on board.
The company said it surveyed passengers nationwide to find out how many people from airport security accidentally smuggled goods and how many were doing so knowingly.
It's no surprise that the most likely people to smuggle security items, whether they want to or not, are the most likely to fly.
Still, as the firm notes, TSA rules are a bit of a mess and a bit of a mess.
People are often unsure of what fluids or how much they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of material seized by the TSA has emerged as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international ones.
China welcomed the US statement
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a press conference in Beijing that he was concerned about Tillerson's administration in Pyongyang, saying, "We are not looking for an excuse to change the regime, collapse the regime, move the peninsula to a rapid reunification and send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang said he reiterated the principles of the Tillerson administration on the North Korean issue, and hoped the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a concrete, result-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Wang stressed that the parties expect them to find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has been overwhelmingly persistent in the process of denuclearization, preserving peace and stability of the peninsula, and resolving problems through dialogue and negotiation.
President Pruitt has given up on delaying EPA's Obama-era emissions reduction laws.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency president Scott Pruitt withdrew his decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws that had previously reduced air pollutant emissions from dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented change in that his organization was more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
He never mentioned the legal challenge to his previous position in a federal high court.
The issue is that states begin meeting the 2015 standards for ground level ozone by the end of October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone compliance by a year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma's attorney general, had long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for the reversal agenda.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the implementation of an Obama administration law that required oil and gas companies to control and reduce methane leaks was overstepping the limits of his authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that the return to ozone standards reinforced EPA's commitment to meet new standards only with states on time and work through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous work, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for decisions, waited for action by activist groups and others, and agreed to settle disputes to set timelines for a decision".
"We don't believe in regulation by lawsuit, and we take term dates seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it has given us seriously".
However, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt could once again use his "power of delay and all other legally available authority" at some point to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone laws.
A bill passed by the House last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The EPA's decision to change the lawsuit after our appeals is a significant improvement in the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the dirty smoke that is flowing to 6.7 million New Yorkers and their communities".
The lawsuit was filed in New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released into the atmosphere by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that respond to sunlight, ground-level ozone is produced.
The dirty smoke that comes out can cause severe breathing problems in a group of people who are quickly affected, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
"It's disturbing that it takes so much pressure to get this sensible name from the conservationist", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological struggle to pollut the environment and to incite interest groups".
Inflation is a single digit
Turkey, which recorded the largest increase in exports in six years, with unemployment at 13 percent in the furnace at 10.5 percent and economic confidence index at 3.5 years, also lowered inflation to one-tenth.
According to data released by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜK), the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 percent in July, while annual inflation fell to a single house for the first time since October with 9.79 percent.
The highest increase in the monthly basis for main spending groups in July was in the restaurant and hotel group with 1.75 percent, while the group with the highest decline was in clothing and footwear with 3.51 percent.
The highest increase on an annual basis was in the transportation group with 15.24 percent.
In July, the inflation rate fell to one house, in parallel with expectations, noted business investment economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu, "In the moderate tour in inflation, the fall in prices of food and clothing groups has an impact".
But unlike the headlines, there's an increase in core indices over the previous month.
"We don't expect a relaxation in the tight position of the Central Bank", he said.
The core inflation indicators have risen despite the fall in headline inflation.
The B index, which is closely monitored by the Central Bank, rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
Capital FX Research Deputy Director Enver Erkan said inflation could be closed at 9.3 percent this year, but that it could "wave until December and fall to a single digit in December".
"The Central Bank may have the opportunity to take over the first months of 2018", he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Shimshek: Inflation will end the year with one single number.
The tightening of the central bank will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We'll finalize the reforms at the next Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation has fallen to a single digit, but it should become permanent.
In order to fight inflation, we need to reduce the fluctuations in food prices and increase supply.
Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan: Due to the basic impact, there may be some upward trend in annual inflation in the coming months, but from the first months of 2018 the decline in inflation will be evident.
We predict annual inflation will go even lower.
I wish Fenerbahce success in their next game.
Franco Foda, Technical Director of Sturm Graz, said that his second half performance was not enough to jump the stage in the UEFA Europa League 3rd preliminary round match, where they were 1-1 with Fenerbahçe.
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Foda said Fenerbahçe were a top team and "we couldn't use the wings in the first half".
We've got a balance in the second half.
We got a second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the flow of the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
The little things in the game were decisive.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next games".
Foda said that they felt very good while in Turkey and were happy with the hospitality they saw.
Fernando is in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started the transfer negotiations of Galatasaray Club, has arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer arrived at Ataturk Airport and was warmly welcomed by the fans.
Fernando, who was greeted with expressions of affection from yellow-red fans, left the airport in a private car waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career with Brazilian side Vila Nova, and wears the uniforms of Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is a midfielder.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after passing a health check.
Galatasaray, who is still in transfer work, has signed a contract with Manchester City for €5.25 million for Fernando, who has been trying to join his squad for a long time.
The flashback from the U.S.
Colonel Dillon, who is attached to the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) from Baghdad via video conference, said that the coalition-trained Rakka Internal Security Force (RIGG) has begun to settle in areas cleared of ISIS in the city.
"The Raqqa Internal Security Force, which consists mostly of Arabs and local anti-ISIS volunteers in the cleared areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning", Dillon said.
Dillon said that 230 more people had joined the group this week, completing their training, adding that "the number of forces involved is 850 so far".
Dillon said the coalition provided the group with basic weapons training as well as training on first aid, armed conflict, scanning and checkpoint operations.
Dillon, who said he was very interested in the RAF, said the coalition would continue to scan applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in the takeover of Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization has appointed PKK terrorist Leyla Mohammed as co-chair of the Rakka civilian administration council.
It is alleged that PKK/PYD members will also be in the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition had collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Shuheda Karyateyn (Shuhuk) in the El Tanif camp in southern Syria, which it cut off support from last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shouk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small arms and light weapons were allowed to stay with them", Dillon said.
The US said last week that it withdrew its support from the Shoukh because it had been patrolling outside the conflict-free zones it had agreed with Russia and was engaged in activities not related to the fight against ISIS.
The group is said to want to fight against ISIS as well as Bashar al-Assad's regime.
According to the leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico into paying for the border wall.
Notes from phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump pressured him not to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States rebuked the Mexican president who held the ball in public against the wall and said, "You can't tell the press".
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised Mexico that he would pay for the project.
Notes from his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which sparked a heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that the U.S. deal to take refugees to Australia was "masked", "rotten" and "stupid", and that the Obama administration deal would make itself "stupid" after proposing a ban on the U.S. placement of refugees.
Mr. Trump ended the speech by saying to Mr. Turnbull, "That was the most unpleasant speech I've ever had all day".
The patient's family broke the doctor's nose.
Doctors and staff of the Turkish Higher Specialist Education and Research Hospital quit their jobs yesterday morning in response to a doctor's friend being beaten by a patient's relatives.
The crowd gathered at the hospital's main entrance with the sign "No to violence in health" in their hands.
Children's cardiology clinic chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayshenur Pach, said, "The slogan 'no to violence in health' seems to me to be inadequate and even a side slogan".
In health, there's no place for violence.
"If this goes down, this people will soon not find a health group to serve themselves", he said.
The activities of the health workers were supported by the Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Turkmen, the General Secretary of the Ankara First Regional Public Hospitals Prof. Dr. Oner Odabaş, the General Doctor of Turkey's Higher Specialist Education and Research Hospital Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the patients in the hospital garden.
Patch, who condemned the incident, said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is on the rise.
An example of this is yesterday evening, when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient's loved one.
While we take all the measures we can as our state, ministry and governorate to stop these events as soon as possible, we also demand that our people become more sensitive to this issue.
I blame yesterday on my patient and my health care workers.
He said: "Unfortunately, this time we live in, it has become a professional complication".
"We will take our own measures, but most importantly, our nation has its own healthcare worker".
Turkmen said that the legal process had begun, and that "our laws on health violence have been effective enough".
The state's ranks are doing that.
Security is working right now.
In the past, these were always empty, but now they're a direct public case, and the state's attorney is assigned, he's following the case.
He used the phrase "There are also examples of severe penalties taken in this regard".
After the explanations, the employees continued their work.
The incident was reported to have occurred around 5:45 p.m. the day before.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care, who gave the news of death, attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the department of heart and blood surgery.
Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants, police were called to the hospital.
The attackers were arrested while Uzbek's nose was broken.
One of the witnesses, a doctor, said:
When our friend went to his patients to report the death of a patient, they attacked our friend and us, and our two friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's in blood.
Then we took our friend and hid him in the O.R.
He's been on security for 15-20 minutes.
If the patient's loved ones had gone beyond that security wall, things would have been much worse.
The attack on Daesh in Gaziantep: 102 bags...
According to the information, as a result of the investigations conducted by the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Gaziantep, the Directorate of Security of Gaziantep, the Directorate of the Counter-Terrorism Branch, conducted intelligence work against the armed terrorist organization ISIS, 5 thousand 100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate were seized in 102 bags of explosives.
In the operation, in which 6 people were detained, the suspects' residence, workplace, warehouse and top searches also seized 10 long-barreled weapons, including 35 chargers, 2 thousand 370 full firearms, 3 guns, 7 chargers and 382 full firearms, 2 hunting rifles and 1 spear, 39 thousand 705 TL and 15 thousand 870) USD, documents of 163 thousand TL, cheques of 40 thousand 500 TL, 2 bags of blank checkbook and a large number of digital materials.
The search also found four books with collections ordered by the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization's publishing bodies.
The six people arrested were taken to the judicial authorities after questioning.
The suspects were arrested by the sentencing officer, the Justice of the Peace.
The YPG raid in Syria...
The U.S. intervened
According to local sources, the AA has obtained information that YPG terrorists have looted homes of residents of Tel Semin, a northern village of Raqqa where the US-backed terrorist organization entered for the purpose of fighting ISIS.
The reaction of the civilians who were robbed and seized their homes turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
Then the US forces in the area entered the city with armored vehicles.
Cougar MRAP armor, personnel carriers and Husky mine detection vehicles were found to form a buffer zone in the belt.
The YPG is not allowing civilians fleeing death in Raqqa, which was shot down as part of the anti-ISIS operation, to enter its controlled cities.
The local activist network "Rakka is silently being slaughtered" reported that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire in July alone.
Let 's not postpone the old-world fights
Delayed perception of domestic and world realities can lead to crises not only for ordinary people but also for countries.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we call "consistency", is delayed in perceiving world realities may be because these realities are being blocked by certain focuses or transmitted beyond reality.
Don Kishot and Oblomov have been a subject of literary debate, either for late perception or for no perception of reality and change.
Cervantes' Don Quixote is a meczup who still considers himself a knight at the beginning of the bourgeoisie.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy legacy that thinks everything can go on as it was when he ignored the facts.
For example, China, a country that was open to the world and dominated the seas until the end of the 15th century, was shut down by the succession of a ruling dynasty.
This lasted until the captains of the ships sailing out of Chinese waters were executed.
We Turks, who have one foot, eye and ear in the West, the other foot, eye and ear in the East, have been constantly in a dilemma in perceiving reality and change, starting with the Ottoman.
We tried to move one of our old and new chapters to today, to understand today with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of yesterday as tomorrow.
And part of us, we've been able to act as fast as the focus of thought in developed countries in perceiving the realities of home and the world and change.
This has led to constant conflict and tension.
The encounter between madrasa and university, the new army and the modern army, faith and doubt, has caused a dramatic content duel.
Even worse, it was not accepted that new and advanced positions at one time would eventually become obsolete and remain behind at certain times.
Yesterday's leaders, after a period of time, began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", while those who tried to interpret the conditions of the country and the world in accordance with the current reality began to declare "Hain".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman era was that those who were late to perceive the reality of home and world dominated thought and state life.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past taught the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of the world's conjuncture and change was an inevitable precondition for its survival.
Because it has absorbed this lesson so well, we have been able to be the model country of geography that has managed to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace since World War I to the present day.
And in order to survive the global transformation process that we're taking a different approach to, we need to leave our memories behind and act on the facts.
In other words, no one will benefit from moving the senseless camps and bloodsuits that have brought about the collapse of our democracy in the past to the present.
And in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to very big, dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East we're in.
Operation of historical works in Musht
The statement from the Governorate said that the operation was carried out by the teams of the Provincial Command of the Gendarmerie.
The statement said: "As a result of the work carried out, two gold coins, one silver coin, 20 bronze coins, one gold bracelet, two bronze rings, one glass bracelet, four stone objects, eight necklaces, one pink and white stone object, one picture frame, 23 stone objects of different sizes and sizes and different colors, four sharp metal objects, 6 old-age covers and pages, and some pages are torn in Arabic Quran-branded books, 1 stone cover, 10 old-age covers and 1 bronze-sized stone object, were examined".
"We will continue our operations in the fight against crime and criminals for the peace and security of our people".
The Turkish wind
Global giants who trust Turkey's future have fought a breaking point in the wind farm lease yesterday.
The world record was broken in the importation of the model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce external dependence on national energy transition.
The investment of 1 billion dollars and nearly 4,000 jobs will also pave the way for lowering Turkey's energy costs.
By the beginning of 2019, domestically produced wind turbines will be incorporated into the system.
Eight consortia including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants joined the renewable energy and natural resources ministry's (YEKA) wind power plant licence lease.
In the import, financial bid envelopes were opened to identify the five bidders who initially offered the lowest bid.
The lowest bid since the first bid envelope was $4.19 per kilowatt hour.
The open range of reduction is set to 0.01 cents.
After the acquisition, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas, the joint venture groups involved, decided not to participate in the open cut.
In the open draw, teams including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
After the withdrawal of the consortium, which also includes Nordex, MingYang-I Construction and Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon remained the last two.
MingYang-First Building has taken 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Türker-Kalyon Energy consortium has never used a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: Record day for Turkey.
The open cutoff went on for 30 laps.
The strong rivalry between the two consortia was won by the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid at $3.48 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The consortium offered $3.49 cents per kilowatt-hour in export, but withdrew its offer to $3.48 at the request of the export commission headed by Deputy Vice President Alparslan Bayraktar.
Turkey has set a world record in the two-hour YEKA qualification.
The $3.48/cents per kilowatt hour offered for export is the lowest in the world for this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84 per kilowatt-hour.
Berat Albayrak, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, who held a press conference after the conclusion of the competition, said that the victory of the German company Siemens is an important message to the region and the world, saying, "Looking at the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations".
Our goals are big.
The results of today's economic and energy market research have shown how steady and secure the future is.
I was very proud to show that, no matter how many regional crises there are in the world, Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the most reliable countries in the world where investments can be made.
"The biggest contribution to this picture, which we are proud of as 80 million people, is our President, who led Turkey to this point with 15 years of power and leadership", he said.
Albayrak said that they are beginning a new era with open, transparent and competitive trade, saying: "One of the most important steps of this was that the purchase cost of 10.3 dollars/cent per kilowatt-hour with the domestic contribution to wind until yesterday, fell to a historic record of 3.48 dollars/cent, a world record price".
I'm proud of it, on behalf of my people, on behalf of my country.
Minister Albayrak noted that they aim to put in operation the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, and said, "I hope that by the beginning of 2019 we will incorporate our domestic production wind turbines into the system".
Turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winning company will receive a total of 1,000 megawatts of installed wind power in each of these five regions, with the condition that it installs at least 50 megawatts of wind power.
The total investment of the Siemens-Türker-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With the start-up of local wind farms, at least 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity will be generated each year and about 1.1 million homes will have annual electricity needs met by wind.
The wind farms will also reduce CO2 emissions by an average of 1.5 million tonnes per year.
The winning company will build a factory with an investment of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will conduct 10 years of R&D in at least three of the areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox.
With a budget of $5 million per year for R&D, 50 technical personnel, 80 percent of them domestic engineers, will be employed.
The factory will be set up 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's licensing period is 30 years.
Kazım Türker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Turkerler İnşaat, said that the project will generate about 64 percent domestic production, with 35 percent of the equipment coming from abroad, and that "we plan to provide financing for the equipment from foreign sources, and the rest from domestic banks".
Turk said the fraud reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, president of Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said: "It was a transaction that would reduce Turkey's dependence on foreign sources by a thousand megawatts".
"You're happy with the result", he said.
Senior Director of SIemens Gamesa Turkey Hakan Yıldırım also noted that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years, saying, "We will do everything we can to further reduce the cost of electricity units".
The local capacity of wind turbines to be produced at the plant will be at least 65 percent.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be indigenous (at least 5,200 pieces).
In each of the five regions, at least 50 MW, a total of 1000 MW will be installed.
Employment of 3,750 people 10 years R & D necessity 5 million dollars to be allocated to R & D activities every year
1,000 MW Wind Power Plant 65% Location Area Production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 MWe.
Over $1 billion investment, 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity, over $100 million of plant investment.
Electricity generation to meet the needs of approximately 1.1 million households Every year at least 3 billion kWh of electricity generation Average 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year emissions reduction.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists revived the racist lynching incident for a call to justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed through a crowd in rural Monroe, Georgia, and proceeded narrowly to the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
Four black passengers and a white driver, a group of armed white men, before reaching the bridge, came forward to block the road.
The gang leader, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a long breath from his cigarette butts and looked through the windshield.
The people inside were terrified.
"We want this, Roger!" he said.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat as screams tore through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on June 22 is just a re-enactment.
But when a scientific shot was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience took a pretty realistic breath.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "Even if we see them in our communities, even if we know who they are, it doesn't make sense that not one person has been arrested in all these years".
"It's a stain on history but a burden on our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong human rights advocate.
For her, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been rectified.
He said: "We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to be wrapped up, we want reconciliation but we must first get justice".
"We cannot have the wounds wrapped up and reconciled until justice is done".
The coroner's office is putting a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynching in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
But not one of them has ever been investigated.
While the suspects have been on the run for decades, human rights defenders say the twin motivations of the lynchings have always been well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in a primary election for the first time that summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time as the election, black associate Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight over a woman he apparently had.
Brooks explained that the rumour in town was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to jail.
But as they drove away from prison, they reached Ford Bridge in Moore and a gang of lynchings surrounded the car.
An FBI report concluded, "It appears that Harrison arranged and ordered the murders".
"It's also clear that there was a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement authorities that not only involved in the murder, but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks is shorter and more self-contained.
He said, "That was a massacre of the right to vote".
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this community, 'If you register and vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual revival of the Ford Bridge at Moore.
His performance takes into account all the details, is remarkable, and is based on a deep form of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn their eyes, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it's what makes us all ugly inside".
"But if you don't listen to me or what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you".
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) filled a room and listened as Greene enters the game's well-rehearsed overviews.
Wade Marbaugh is serving as Greene's assistant director.
For years, he's been the president of the Klan, but he says the role never got easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel hurt because it's not me".
"But I think it's important to keep that past alive because we don't want to go back to that time".
Actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room rehearsed their lines with Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona.
The game begins when Malcolm shouts at Hester, who is so angry about sleeping with his wife Dorothy, and pushes her.
"Z...i, I said get off my property!"
He's reacting to Rascona.
There's a knock.
And then everybody (at least black actors) gets all laughed at.
Greene laughs the most.
"What?!" he asked Rascona.
He was so excited, he was surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said no, in a whisper.
"I just don't think white people called me a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a... a...
One of the black players threw a mixed-up rock with a joke, saying "Yes".
"'You have to press the 'R'".
So the energy in the room changes and some kind of intimacy takes the place of restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to making this right, not just for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene is starting again.
This time Rascona says the word that starts with N, sharp and emphatic.
No one's laughing at all.
The revival is ending violently and quickly.
There's screaming, gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in black stands on the bodies of actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad song "Poor Fruit".
It's a broken word in both words.
A hundred yards back, an average of four dozen spectators wiping their sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided into black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of them on the way.
Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys, all of whom endured the overwhelming humidity of Georgia for almost eight hours.
Up until this point, the murders were an anecdote, but now standing where the lynch is means the air is cursed.
As the final notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to approach and examine the bodies.
The children lie on their hands, grabbing fake blood and motionless bodies and whispering to each other.
A little kid whispers, like he reminds himself, "They're not really dead".
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and he's done.
Actors throw a cord and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh in the suit playing President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow actors and tears flow in their arms, and the emotional cost of the performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's okay".
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Then the audience sits down to eat with the actors.
A white couple from Atlanta is sitting at a table having a hot chat with a black couple about revival.
Denise Duplinski is having a hard time finding the words to describe how her performance made her feel.
He said, "Hearing these horrible, horrible words and these behaviors... come from people who look like you and they do it because they look like you".
"What it does to me is make me think that the lynchings are still going on", he added, "these are now just police armed attacks".
Tyrone Brooks is the focus of attention at the end of the room, eating at the table and telling her about her human rights memories.
He said he's already started planning his next year's performance.
"The revival is inspiring in a way because it describes what we have endured but it is also educational", he said.
"As if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their past, those who do not know their past, are condemned to repeat it".
Accident in Mugla: 4 dead, 6 wounded
According to information received, the 48 YS 411 license plate car under the administration of Adam Sağlam collided with the 09 B 1510 license plate car under the administration of Sinan Kiroglan at Salkım on the Kavaklidere-Yatağan highway.
A large number of health and rescue teams were deployed to the scene on the alert to the 112 Emergency Call Center.
Derya Kiroglan and Yasemin Salam, who were reported to be eight months pregnant with Duraniye Kiroglan, died at the scene, while Mertjan Kiroglan died at the Yatağan State Hospital, where he was removed.
Sinan, Senem, Furkan and Kiroglan were taken to the Yujelen Hospital and the Sikh University of Education and Research Hospital in Sikh Kochman.
It's been learned that the lives of the wounded are still at risk.
The Yatağan-Kavaklidere highway was temporarily closed to traffic due to the accident.
Kavaklidere Mayor Mehmet Demir and Yatağan Gendarmerie Commander Captain Engin January also arrived at the scene and received information about the accident.
A website dedicated to the AK Party
By the AK Party, 6.
A website called "akkongreler.com" was created for the regular congressional process.
The website contains brochures, materials, and videos that the party organization will use in this process.
The website's 'Communication Strategy' section lists the rules to be followed during the congress in 14 headings.
President and General President of AK Party Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned members of the organization to comply with the party's corporate identity during the congress.
In his message, Erdogan said, "We are now entering a new era of transition".
We must be renewed and renewed to achieve our 2023 targets with more solid steps.
"We must continue working hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, as yesterday", he said.
Pearson has made 3,000 more layoffs to revive the business, cutting the profit.
British education group Pearson said it would launch another restructuring programme on Friday to overcome the pressure facing the business, adding 3,000 layoffs and cutting its mid-term profit by 72 percent.
Chief Executive John Fallon said the layoffs, which will mostly come at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to save an additional 300 million pounds ($394 million) by trying to re-establish the business that is rapidly moving to digital learning with a third cost-cutting program.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in prospects for this year after reporting its core sales up 1 percent in the first half, to £2.05 billion.
Text 2 has led to death again!
According to the first report of the Forensic Service, the first findings in Hakan's autopsy report indicate that the death was suicide.
In the detailed examination, no puncture or algebraic marks were found on the child's body.
The suicide was caused by the tightness of the elastic bandage around his neck.
The bandage, which his family identified as a bandage, was also found to be an elastic bandage used in wounds.
According to the newspaper Habertürk, after the detailed report on the child's death was prepared, it was learned that the report indicating that the incident was suicide would be sent to the Grandçekmece Republic Prosecutor's Office, which is conducting the investigation.
While police are investigating the child's suicide in detail, they're also running scans on the computer seized after the incident.
It was stated that the police will also appeal the statement of Hakan's friends.
It also says that information from the computer of Hakan, whom his relatives call "Cleaned", can be accessed by third parties or a gang.
Police are considering that Hakan was dragged to suicide by a gang.
The fact that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes into violent Metin2
In 2009, the murder of 13-year-old "minimal hacker" Metin Kang, who was banned by the Antalya Governorate last year for child abuse and abuse, came to the fore.
To play "Message 2", developed in Korea in 2005, you have to log in and register as a member.
Players try to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
There's wars going on, violence rising.
The game features battle scenes with cutting-edge, puncture-edged weapons such as lines, swords, spears, axes, and images of humans being torn apart by wild animals and their flesh eaten.
The player buys characters for money to be stronger.
The family, who threw their children into the ground the next day, claimed murder after the incident on July 25 at their home in Köknar Street in Esenyurt Istiklal neighborhood.
Father Mehmet Ekinci said, "All my dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could hurt himself or anyone else because of the game", he said, "They wrapped an elastic wrap around his neck and knotted him sideways".
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think our son could harm himself or anyone else by playing an online game or committing suicide.
We knew you played a game like that.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say he gets a little bored and gets out of the game.
Mother Gulzar Seed says, "No one goes in and out of the building".
They say my kid came home at a certain time.
None of them hold each other.
When his brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when he was buried, there were two chairs next to the computer", she said.
He may have been involved in the gang.
Families generally don't pay attention to this.
They're looking at my kid at home, whatever's going on.
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a loan-to-loan situation or a libel.
Or maybe he invited someone in the game, and they had a problem.
He may have been influenced by the problems he had with other people he communicated with, not directly from the game, but through the game.
The child may have thought the game's visuals, the fiction, real.
The trauma that led to the suicide could be related to blackmail.
If the child is facing a situation where the family is being complained about, then he's also facing a situation where he's not going to be able to solve the problem.
He couldn't have killed himself because of the game itself.
There's also the possibility that the kid might be involved.
He could be involved with the gang.
There's nothing that the child could have done alone.
Information systems consultant Füsun NEBIL: Families need to know their children's interactions
We can't say games are harmful.
Studies also show that games are beneficial for children's development.
What's important here is that parents watch what their kids play and how they talk to the players online.
Parents should know how to prevent the effects of content on their children.
In Turkey, there are only two children in the five years he is said to have died from the game.
Which shows that the effect of killing a child is not just the effects of play.
I wonder what was driving this kid to do that.
We need to know that first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the kid.
8 months of return in Istanbul stood at 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend in July, which began in December 2016, and moved its upward trend to the 8th month.
The index thus rose for the first time since July 2007 to 45.3 percent during this period, when it recorded an eight-month rise in a row.
The BIST 100 index, which has been showing performance since the beginning of the year, has also been lagging behind the world's leading exchanges, including Germany, the US, the UK, Japan, and has not lost its lead in revenue in July.
The BIST 100 index, which completed July with a 7.06 percent increase, followed the Dow Jones index in the United States with a 2.54 percent increase, followed by the FTSE 100 index in the United Kingdom with a 0.81 percent increase.
The DAX index in Almaya and the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a loss.
Looking at the January-July period, the BIST 100 index showed a high performance from both the major world exchanges and the emerging country stock market indexes.
The BIST 100 followed this year's closing year with a 37.6 percent gain, the Dow Jones index with a 10.76 percent increase, the DAX index with a 5.55 percent gain, the Nikkei index with a 4.55 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, which is an indicator for emerging markets, yielded 23 percent.
The BIST 100 index has shown similar performance in the past, as seen through the historical process.
The BIST 100 index, which last completed eight consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, recorded a 38.3 percent increase over this period.
It also completed the BIST 100 index by gaining values in eight consecutive months between August 1996 and March 1997, and nine consecutive months between May 1997 and January 1998.
In a statement to AA, Eren Jan Umut, Director of Mexa Investment Research, noted that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, recording that the rise has exceeded 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
Hope noted that the MSCI's emerging markets (EM) index has risen 23 percent, and that even if we look at these rates, there is a positive divide.
The flow of funds to developing countries has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.
Especially those in the high-yield market prefer countries with higher interest rates.
In this case, the domestic markets are positively affected.
And of course, the appetite for risk on a global scale is also very high.
This makes the risk-weighted stock indexes popular.
In the US, we're seeing new record levels being tested almost every week, in parallel to the S&P 500 rising by nearly 11 percent since Christmas.
Earlier this year, the Fed stressed that the US Central Bank's (Fed) 3% interest rate hike was stressing the forecasted markets but that the Fed was very good at using its policy of verbal redirection to eliminate uncertainty.
Hope said inflation in the U.S. is not yet at the desired level, and that the Fed's expectations of not rushing to raise interest rates and avoiding radical moves are also highly influential on current pricing.
Speaking of the fact that President Donald Trump's failure to cancel healthcare reform known as "Obamacare" reinforced the perception that broad fiscal policies could not deliver on his promises, Hope said, "While the expectations of the faster-growing U.S. economy due to Trump have had a positive impact on stock markets for a period of time, the failure of the promises is reinforcing the Fed's and the market's hand in response to faster growth and faster inflation".
Umut noted that 2016 was a year of many negative developments for the Turkish markets, and said that the gap between the negative and over-sold BIST 100 index was in an effort to close.
Noting that they have not seen a strong recovery with domestic news streams, Umut noted that the current view may be interpreted as triggering a desire to close the gap between increased appetite for risk abroad and similar ones in domestic markets.
Umut stated that he was monitoring some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tests new records at 108,600 levels:
Especially the 109,500 to 110,000 area is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for profit sales to occur after they're close to these levels.
We think that in the short term, a new story must be created, local or global, for the over 110,000 prices.
A downward trend of 107,500 supports could trigger profit sales.
In this case, I think we can see a loosening of 106,000 to 105,500, even if we follow 107,000 callbacks.
In particular, breaking the 105,500 support could lead to a retreat to 104,300 levels, which is equivalent to Fibo's 50 percent of the increase from 100,000 to 108,600.
Noting that both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the center of global market, General said expectations for the Fed are already clear, but that the possibility of a budget reduction program to take effect in September could trigger a strengthening in the US dollar, even if interest rate increases are not expected in the FOMC.
He added that the situation could trigger profit sales in the short-term stock indexes of developing countries (EMs) that are in the shadow of over-purchase.
After the July meeting of the monetary policy council, ECB President Mario Draghi stated that they would discuss the monetary policy sequence in the autumn, which led to the euro/dollar parity rising above the 1,1700 levels.
So the announcements that the €60 billion monthly asset purchase programme will be cut or terminated would mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be cut by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may occur on behalf of markets such as Turkey, which offer high current openings and require access to external funds".
Erol Gürcan, Director of the GoD Investments Investment Advisory, also said that after Trump's election as president in November 2016, there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets.
Gürcan noted that the key element that triggered the rally was likely to be developments that boosted global growth expectations, including Trump's early promises of tax cuts:
The stock exchange Istanbul also topped the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained relatively stable over recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, it is worth noting that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active in March, has had a serious impact on the so far-observed rise in the index.
In the rest of the year, Gürcan said that the positive developments were reflected in the prices and that KGF, which played an important role in this rise, was gradually reaching satisfaction, although the BIST 100 index still remains unchanged compared to similar country markets, a new story search could gradually come to the fore for the rest of the year.
The 180-day action plan, which has been waiting for a long time to be shared, noted that improvements such as the increase of the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the establishment of regulations to support company profits, and the possible tax reduction that may be on the agenda in the near future can contribute positively to this.
Gürcan stressed that the fact that the central banks of major developed countries such as the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will gradually tighten the existing expansionary monetary policy positions is also among the critical risk elements for developing countries, and assessed that "the Fed, which has been continuing to moderate interest rate increases for some time, will most likely begin the balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility of the ECB terminating its asset purchase program in the near future and the fact that BOE will be one of the major developed country central banks that will raise interest rates after the Fed will be the first developments to be followed in this sense".
Gürcan said that the 104,150-104,600 support area, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average, is very critical in the possible correction movements in the index in the coming period, with the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year, and that the correction movement may continue to 101,700, 100,000, 99.200 levels in the event of breaking this support area.
Gürcan said that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current historical peak of 108,605 is broken, the index can rise to 110,000-112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO military killed in suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several.
NATO said five soldiers and one translator were wounded.
Unidentified local sources say all three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh area of the city.
The bombing was the latest violent incident in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the Thursday night explosion was carried out with a "personnel-guided hand-made explosive" in a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the wounded were in good condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major concern for NATO forces, who are negotiating near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1,662 civilians, with an average of 20 percent in the capital.
A suicide car bombing in a predominantly Shiite area of Kabul in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack themselves.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs on whether or not to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have created a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA has stopped delaying air pollution policy after the lawsuits.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency returned a day after the decision to delay an Obama-era law that required states to curb emissions of dirty smoke, with 15 states suing the organization over the initiative.
Late Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozone Resolutions", saying the organization demonstrated its determination to work with the states.
EPA president Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and in being sensitive to them".
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA intends to delay its ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, which measures existing dirty smoke pollution in various parts of the country and determines where the cut is required to meet stricter air quality standards.
Fifteen states and the District of Columbia, which are predominantly Democrats, filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming that the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump continues to seek to recover the wide range of environmental regulations enacted by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls reviving economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the public health effects of more emissions.
EPA's website says that breathing in ozone-containing air "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma".
The forest has given the good news...
The line is on the stopper and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Orman has made statements to Bein Sports regarding Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the transfer of the stoper.
The idea of the forest is this:
There's no surprise in the transfer.
We're not about too much transfer, we're about point shooting.
Now we're gonna do a stop and a wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, hopefully we can draw a good ball.
We have to make a mandatory wing transfer.
10 million is easy, but we don't have that budget.
We'll transfer if it comes to our own budgets, or we won't die if we don't.
I can't give you any information about the lens without clarifying.
We're a public company.
Patience is the end of peace.
Is the threat of ISIS only for August 30th, not for the festival?
Ankara's governorate continues to respond to the ban on all mass events, including sit-ins, memorial gatherings and similar events, during the month of August on the grounds of the "ISIL threat".
The governor's decision to ban "all mass events" includes the phrase "all mass events" in Ankara.
The Grand International Festival of Ankara is still going on.
In a statement to SÖZCÜ, CHP Group President and Ankara National Deputy Levent Gök said that "30 August could not be affected by the bans", adding:
He's in a serious mess.
Even the governor is hesitant about what decision to make.
The state's job is to create spaces for celebrations.
Ankara's CHP MP Murat Emir also said, "All Ankara has security problems, only Gökçek's organizations have no security problems".
Ankara's independent deputy Aylin Nazliaka has taken the ban to the parliament.
Asked by the Prime Minister for a response, Nazlyaaka said, "Does this ban not clearly show the AKP's hostility towards the republic and Ataturk?
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was being deceived"
Demet Shener, who is still in divorce proceedings with Ibrahim Kutluay, was at his lawyer Aslı Hatemi's house the day before.
Schener, who filed a mental health claim against Edwina Sponza, who claims to have destroyed her home, presented photos of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence to the court.
The socialite Sponza also made a criminal complaint against Shener, saying, "Demet illegally seized my private photos".
"I Didn't Know How to Eat"
After this latest development, Schener, who met his lawyer in Nichansache Delicatessen, saw the journalists and left the place.
When she was reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, she laughed, "Oh, my God, I must have walked into your house and taken it".
Actually, the fact that Sponza's complaint is "There's a complaint, but the content is not right".
"We have everything, we have brought it to court", he said.
"In recent times, everyone knew your wife had an affair with Sponza".
"How could you not know?" he asked in astonishment.
What? What?
How did you do that?
"I swear I didn't know", said Shener, "would I believe my husband looking into my eyes or the rumor of my people?"
When reporters asked him "Have you never heard?" he said "No", and then he said, "I didn't, of course I heard it the first time".
But I never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, it was in place, there was nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when you gave me everything, I learned everything, so...
When asked "Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" the answer was "Yes", and the photos and correspondence he submitted to the court were confused, claiming that Sponza himself had sent them to him.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a montage.
The pawnbroker will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow.
The Beşiktaş Club will officially add Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo to the squad tomorrow.
A signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, who has agreed in principle to be transferred by Beşiktaş to Valencia.
The signing ceremony will be attended by the club president Fikret Orman at 12:00.
Meanwhile, the Spanish footballer will be undergoing a medical check-up tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you so much for your respect and support".
I also send the Emir of Qatar's greetings to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Qatari economy has shown resistance.
In many countries, the economies are negatively affected, while our economy is stable.
We must do everything we can to ensure Qatar's independence and strength.
We have broken the embargo on us in a matter of hours thanks to Turkey.
We're not short on anything right now.
Our natural resources, our natural gas exports, are a major support to Qatar's economy.
We were not affected by Turkey's cruel and unlawful treatment of us.
Today, Qatar is again producing natural gas and LNG worldwide.
"We saw a 30 percent increase in natural gas exports after the population, not a decline", he said.
Al Thani said that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey are ongoing in all areas, adding that "the volume of trade between us amounted to $554 million in the first quarter".
Recent decisions have played a role in this.
As a result of the Turkish products proving themselves on the Qatari market, it is extremely important for us to accelerate the import of goods from Turkey in all sectors, to invest in many areas.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us", he said.
Cost of recent disasters 300 million TL
The head of the TSB, Jan Akın Çağlar, noted that after the flood of July 18, insurance companies received 7 thousand damage reports of 116 million TL, the Gökova earthquake of July 21 received 12 million 800 liras and the flood and flood of Istanbul on July 27 received 168 million liras 22 thousand damage reports, the last three events found insurance costs of 300 million liras.
"The damage caused by the full-load of casco insurance is about 3,500 liras per vehicle, and the damage caused by the glass is about 1,000 liras".
"And the average house damage in an earthquake is 6,000 liras", he said.
Stressing that they are making a lot of efforts as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Jan Akın Çağlar said that 3 out of 4 people do not have housing insurance, one out of every 2 businesses does not have fire insurance and 2 out of 3 people do not have helmet insurance, saying: "The risk of natural disasters due to climate change is increasing".
The risk of serious damage to our citizens and institutions is increasing day by day due to the low rate of insurance in our country.
All these costs should not be left to the state.
Insurance policies aren't as expensive as they're thought, and insurance is not just a loss-making industry, but it also provides risk management consulting.
Increasing insurance awareness and coverage is very important for our people and our country.
"In general terms, Kasko insurance states that insured persons must report their losses within 5 working days, and that period ended yesterday".
He replied to the question "Will the insured be a victim?" "Although in general circumstances such a period is possible, the Commercial Law has a period of two years".
"It's also a natural disaster, so insurers don't have to panic, no company says I'm not paying", he said.
That's how the German media saw the giant invasion!
At a time when the tensions between Turkey and Germany are increasing, the German company Siemens won Turkey's first wind energy renewable energy sources (YEKA) tender.
German media reported the development saying "German Siemens has gained a huge reputation in Turkey".
DWelle Türkçe reported that the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender, saying: "The consortium will invest over 1 billion dollars in wind power plants".
The report, which used the words "The export opened for the creation of wind power capacity of 1,000 megawatts, has the characteristics of being the first YEKA export of Turkey", said that the number of companies competing in export today fell from 8 to 2, facing Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortia, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrew at the start of the 30th round.
After the announcement, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak made striking statements on Turkey-Germany relations.
The acquisition resulted in the acquisition of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this image is a significant message to the region and the world.
Looking at the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
I was very proud to show that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world's most reliable investment countries, no matter how many regional crises there are in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible fight.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will be crossing paths to showcase the most satisfying boxing match of the near future for 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall and greeted World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
In a Saturday showtime vote, former world champion Adrien Broner is among the top five on the list of cyclists not watched after Garcia's defeat.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you".
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday night at 7:00.
While the pair were posing for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar recorded that a potential match between the fighters would be "in perfect size".
Garcia made a reminder, "I shaved an old feather".
"I went up for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get a little fucked up.
He needs to go to the lightweight cycle, then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko has joined us.
"The boxer needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be in 'the hopes and dreams'; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 nacavts) next summer and fighting Lomachenko in a 135 pound opening match this year was part of his strategy; Garcia also expressed interest in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
Garcia said, "The fight could be in 'get up and watch' because all the fans want it", and then stated that he was open to which channel offered the best financial package.
We're the main names.
No other name is so interesting.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and could attend Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated on Garcia's extoling knee, saying he thought the three-time Riverside Cycling champions looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey... you wanted the bum".
Garcia said the boy was first showing his punching power, then boxing.
Both said they felt the momentum was created for their encounter.
"This is a fight to be fought.
No other fight will generate that much attention and rumor.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to be dealing with this".
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the best fighters, and that was Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
Turkish Resti from Russia to America
The White House is not considering sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those lines.
That's because the borrowing costs are rising.
Worried that Western investment partners might consider withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin has in turn accelerated the construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Stream line to Turkey from the Black Sea, has accelerated construction at Gazprom's request.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has also begun construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "with great speed" to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's age assessment test have been announced
The latest results of the assessment tests of refugees subjected to a new medical age assessment in Sweden found that more than 80 percent of those tested were over the age of 18, but not everyone was confident in the validity of these tests.
The Swedish National Office for Forensic Medicine and Medicines (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate during the petition process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized the failure of some refugees to assess their correct age, claiming they were not minors.
Migrationsverket has so far sent 6880 cases to the test and the Office of Forensic Medicine and Medicine has now released the results of the tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (of the 2002 figure) were found to be 18 or older, and in 25 cases the Office of Forensic Medicine and Medicine ruled the experiment "probably 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the result was "probably under 18".
Tests were only done in cases where the age of the person was suspected.
According to Johan Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals, the results are consistent with the past few months.
He told The Local, "We don't see much difference in the statistics from the last few months, the numbers are pretty consistent".
The high rate of cases in which you are convicted of being over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that you are lying about your age.
In May, the district released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases where "the subjects examined showed that they were 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 cases, it found that 243 cases had publicly declared their 18th birthday this year.
The medical age assessment method involving x-rays of 20-year-old teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then analyzing them for dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute who evaluates the biological maturity of people whose studies have found that they entered the age of discovery earlier or later than normal.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I think that's not the kind of measurement that should be used.
It's very questionable to judge biological age in this way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be".
However, Göransson of the Office of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals argued for the validity of the tests: "You can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is generally low.
The greatest risk is being under 18, in this case, around 10 percent".
Star Hamidiye Mosque is opening today
The Star Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdulhamit in 1885 to architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship today with Friday prayer after restoration work.
Mürsel Yalli, the district manager, said that the restoration work started in June 2013 was completed and the mosque was ready for opening.
Yellow said, "Restoration work has been carried out in two phases".
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
The first part cost about 16 million pounds and the environmental management costs about 11 million pounds.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were uncovered, and after they were defeated, the outer walls, the contamination of the external factors, the rust were cleared.
Drainage of the reinforcement has been done.
As you can see, when we get into the mosque, it's richly decorated.
It's a work with star motifs, and it's also very rich in pencil work.
There's a mixed style here.
"There are also traces of Celtic architecture, which is also influenced by the Baroque style, considering that it was built in the Ottoman period and 1885".
The U.S.A. has a problem.
"Avize of German Emperor II in the middle of the mosque".
It had some partial defects, was renovated and cleaned and hung in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the mosque, symmetrical in shape, which we call "salut".
We know that these were made by our great master, Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we know how he did it himself and how it was installed here.
They're still standing here in their original state.
Yellow said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the opening ceremony.
Pantic's claim to the eye
The Ukrainian press reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer who could not be hired in Kiev could be hired by the yellow-red club.
Pantic, who started for the Serbian national football team Red Star, wore the Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves uniforms in Spain.
Pantic signed Dynamo Kiev in the middle of last season.
West Virginia governor announced he's changing party
West Virginia Democratic governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night that he would change parties at a rally with President Trump.
Governor Justice said, "Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have left me".
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor".
The rally was in a state of shock.
"So tomorrow I'm going to change my record to Republican", Justice added.
"If I were the technical director, I'd say it's time to put together a different game".
Mr. Trump had promised to make an important announcement earlier at a West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and the Democratic nominee, Justice, did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states through his father's coal business.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress issued a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to work to prevent it from making our country great again".
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS: "With only 15 governors and the least number of state legislatures in history, the Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from the ground up and doesn't find a positive, unifying message".
I will do what is best for Turkey
The third Olympic, Turkey's record holder.
He was born in Cuba but he celebrated his homeland in Turkey, where he came to F. Bahçe...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national uniform...
First he became European champion, then Olympic third...
And now one of Turkey's most important medal hopes at the World Championships in Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, who is competing in the 400m hurdles, spoke to SABAH ahead of the championship, which begins today.
They didn't want you because they didn't like your degrees in Cuba when you were younger.
You've improved your coaching skills.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some think you chose Turkey for the money.
What do you think?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
And from that moment on, I can say that I have drawn a line on what I have been through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
I got into the national team thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They offered me a backup.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I was very disabled when I was young, but after the opportunities I was offered in Turkey, I made great strides in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to make the best of the World Championships and win a different title.
You cried at a press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever I'm asked about Turkey's adoption, I think of my childhood, I think of being kicked out of the Cuban national team at 23.
And of course, people in Turkey are coming to me.
I felt the same way when I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, when I was playing the Styx.
I couldn't hold back my tears.
I also thank Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I'm so happy you're on the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said before that you could have a Turkish boyfriend.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
You want to share your experience?
The greatest plus of being with a Turk is calm...
Compared to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls are getting along.
Your girlfriend's also an assistant coach.
You're together all day, and does it interfere with your diet?
She eats sweeter than me.
(Laughter) I don't really have a strict diet, but it does interfere with what I eat from time to time.
My coach Massimo Matrone has been giving me strict warnings on my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How do you cook with Turkish food?
Turkish women cook very well, but my girlfriend does better.
(Laughter) And the dried beans and rice are my first choice.
I just love him
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He's replaced me with other young men.
We met in Cuba after winning medals for Turkey.
He looked at me and pointed me at the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him".
I just laughed at him.
I 'm a beauty
I'm curious about the glasses you wear in the races...
I'm just using it for concentration.
The moment I wear my glasses, I cut off my connection to the world and build walls on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
When we say Tokyo 2020, what comes to mind first?
Felix Sanchez is...
She won a gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2012 London Olympics at age 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, for whatever reason.
Turks are backing up
Turkcell's Deputy General Manager Ismail Heat said they believe Yasmani Capello will succeed in London, saying, "We sincerely believe Yasmani will represent our flag in this championship as well".
We wish all our athletes to compete in London success.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athletics and greater achievements for our country", he said.
Coe extends a "sincere" apology to Russia for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the global athletics boss, praised Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that it was not the right time for the country to re-admit to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country's ban on the sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to all athletes who were forcibly stripped of their gold and silver medals in the competition.
Despite its own assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to lift the ban in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF President Coe told reporters, "I think today is a very candid response, a very candid presentation".
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted her, that she had survived her troubled days and that she had done everything possible to ensure the reorganization of the Federation".
Coe also said he was "pleased" that Russia accepted the readmission criteria itself.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's being taken, but Congress supports the proposal that the task force is not the right time to return Russia's rights", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from a flawed system".
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday, as neutral.
IAAF task force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still working freely.
Denial of news from the US to the YPG
The US Embassy in Ankara said no tanks were supplied to any of the fighting sides in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
The embassy's statement, titled "Explanation on the false news in the press about the troops going to Syria", said:
In a series of false reports in the press in recent days, it has been falsely claimed that the US has falsely sent hundreds of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not supplied tanks to any group fighting ISIS in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military assistance, primarily light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including the KLA, are fighting to clear the area and regain their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be above last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investments made last year came after July.
Ermut, who said that there was no decrease in investments due to the FETÖ coup attempt, said that "maybe there would have been more growth, so he hit the net".
Maybe if these conditions hadn't happened, if there hadn't been some regional improvements, we could have seen more growth with the impact of the multiplier.
So we're more hopeful for next year.
I hope it's a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
We're already up 11 percent from the first five months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there's more".
"Whether global or regional developments are necessary, they are not causing us concern", Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that by 2010 75% of direct investments would normally come from Europe, and continued:
That's down to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share went from 2 percent to 7 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do that, some problems arose between the Gulf states.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries is saddening us and is causing investors to delay their decisions a little bit.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but we may be experiencing some delays as a result.
Arda Ermut recalled that there were some events in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has clearly and decisively reacted to this situation.
When speaking to investors in the countries where the most severe political crisis is taking place, President Erdoğan's reaction was, "Look, problems happen between governments, they certainly don't happen between peoples".
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different for us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they come to us, and we solve it.
Ermut said that he would not allow them to be victimized, and that he would continue to support all investors.
Ermut said, "We can guarantee that in the future".
You'll see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some political problems in any way will have a problem.
I hope, on the contrary, that we will do our best to increase investment from these countries.
We think the investment coming from here will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect their perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our best at this point, so that neither our investors nor the perception of the investment environment are affected".
TYDTA President Ermut said that after the one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey has started to get great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are solved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In the relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We have suffered because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we are fleeing'".
Ermut said, "We have about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio now in German companies".
So, of the companies we interviewed from all over the world, almost 10 percent are German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's gonna raise his investment or he's got a topic, and we're gonna keep it open as a project.
"So German companies are still a big part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut stressed the need for all state institutions to be careful during the period when sensing operations are carried out in Turkey, saying that the issue is sensitive and that even the slightest bad communication can affect it.
Ermut said that what happened in the last two to three weeks was a good lesson:
Investors and politicians have different agendas.
We've always seen that economic relations always put political developments on the line.
Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and important investor.
Because he already has a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the electoral agenda in Germany is increasing this kind of talk.
I think when they get through, they'll get a little more along.
In Saudi Arabia, specifically, the two countries are careful not to make negative statements.
As a result, an investor investing in Turkey is investing in all the surrounding markets.
So there was a bit of a slowdown, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we're still in talks with these investors.
In my personal opinion, investors are waiting for a decision that they might be able to make faster.
We don't have a Saudi investor who says, 'I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in a negative sense, I'm getting out of here.'
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who still live in Turkey, who are visiting us while they are on holiday, and we follow all the processes.
Recalling that last year, international direct investment (UDY) into Turkey was $12.3 billion, Arda Ermut said, "I think we will definitely exceed that this year.
"But how far we go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect us".
While he hoped that the impact would be more, perhaps a little more limited, Ermut said that the increase was 11 percent for the first 5 months, noting that this could be maintained, saying, "I hope that if there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of the year, one way or another, better than last year".
He also noted that a significant part of the investments will continue to be real estate, and said that new investments could be made in logistics, healthcare, fintech, information technology, petrochemicals, food, energy and manufacturing.
Ermut also stressed that there will be new investments in the coming months, saying, "We may have an investment announcement in the manufacturing sense soon".
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may be investments from the most interesting countries", he said.
Operation of 4 wineries in 9 provinces: 55 arrested
The teams of the Istanbul Bureau of Trafficking Crimes found that the foil coating on the products of 4 wine companies that closed the fungal tap on the products was not glued to the bottle, the TAPDK bandrols were collected after the sale of the products and were marketed with the newly produced wines.
The Oasis team suggested that the government lost 20 million 400 thousand pounds of tax due to the repeated use of the suspects' banners.
Police teams conducted simultaneous operations at 55 addresses of four wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
During the operation, 55 people were detained, while 15 thousand ready-to-sell wines, 52 480 bottles of TAPDK bandrol bottled with capsule, 12 890 TAPDK bandrol bottles, 3 guns and bullets, 100 boxes of sexual pills, 992 escape cigarettes, 698 bottles of various types of fake liquor and 100 litreason anthrax were seized.
The 55 people arrested were taken to the Combating Offenses of Smuggling Branch on Vatan Street.
Suspects are conducting security operations.
The operation of his equipment in the factory, warehouse and workplace was reflected in the police cameras.
Police searched a warehouse and found that he was checking the bottles of wine that were available for sale.
Police have been recorded checking the TAPDK bandroll caps filled with bags of used bottles.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint Germain, France.
The governing body that controls the European game, UEFA, which has the power to prevent teams from competing in the prestigious Champions League, can draw any kind of conclusions from Paris Saint-Germain.
The rules of the 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Game mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without suffering huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of contract alone, and Neymar will rule on a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France are:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG will of course sign Neymar and pay him to join the other stars' galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to buy players, but they have to balance that with legitimate sources of income, as they have a record of success in their football business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that in pursuit of success, clubs that were heavily indebted were engaged in effective fraud and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor club losses rather than focusing on debt.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with potential, spend heavily on improving the team and build a global brand) would become a more challenging venture.
During the three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can suffer a loss of 30 million euros.
Despite Platini's disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, he is still determined to give up his UEFA successor Alexander Cefer without overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen it by moving the rules forward".
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchase price in aggregate, it can extend the fee for the duration of the contract for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal so that the transfer fee can be shown in the next five years' annual accounts as a cost of €44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP investments in 2014 saw the heaviest investments being made in Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was subsequently fined 60 million euros ($82 million for that time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is in a state of aggression against clubs that may try to defraud financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's profit from PSG could come through payments to Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador in 2022, and such a move could be easily exposed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean UEFA will be more careful about attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to the founders, UEFA is not in a preventive negotiation with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
They were not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG, so they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of secrecy.
Recently published figures show that PSG made more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift sales and uniform sales.
The club expects the circus to increase by at least 30 percent once it's signed.
The Spanish league, which was clearly upset by the departure of one of football's greatest players, tried to block Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG had violated the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the clear owner of PSG, citing the fact that "this is an open 'financial doping' case with the club and the state".
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns his own club, an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being financed by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday: "This is the result of having it and it has completely changed the whole football floor in the last 15 years".
"Anything is possible once a country has a club.
It's very difficult to respect financial fair play because for a country, representing a country with such a big player can lead to different methods or different interests.
Insurers' 'higher price' revolt
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been suffering from traffic losses since 2006.
In 2015, the sector lost 2.35 billion TL, and in 2016, it only made a profit of 19 million TL.
The stock exchange operates in Istanbul, with Aksigorta, Anatolian Insurance and Sun Insurance.
Speaking at the meeting where TSB's first six months of 2017 results were assessed, Çağlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached TL 7.3 billion, and that the sector's loss through the application of ceiling premiums this year is projected to increase to TL 2.3 billion, with the estimated damage-prim ratio rising to 125 percent.
Aglar, who said the 2015 figure will be captured this year, noted that the losses recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other industries, saying, "This means that by financing the bad driver we are also increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy".
"75 percent of the sector is foreign, and our foreign partners have somehow financed the bad driver", he said.
The ages, he continued:
We don't expect to make a profit on traffic, but we can't see any year we've made a profit on traffic over the past 11 years.
"We accept that too, but we also hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, together with other policemen".
Saying that the damage to traffic led to dramatic price increases when other products also led to profitability, Aggarlar said, "In 2012, there were price increases of around 30 percent in traffic insurance, it almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest loss in our history".
"Even in an environment where prices have so much increased, at the end of 2016 our profit in traffic was only 19 million TL", he said.
The Aglar said they expect the free fare to be passed next year, "We will lower the price of a good driver in a free fare and apply a higher price to a bad driver".
"But the Treasury is looking at the general trend, the final word on when it will be is with the Treasury", he said.
The Treasury Department noted that the increase in mandatory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a large part of society, and it has implemented the maximum premium (top price) from 12 April.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory road insurance policies are determined for each vehicle group, county groups, based on traffic statistics and traffic density.
On the other hand, in July, the "Pool of Risk Insured" app for high-frequency stages or vehicle groups was implemented in compulsory traffic insurance.
The premiums and losses on the pool's traffic insurance policies will be shared between the insurance companies.
The premiums of these insured will be determined by the Treasury Department.
The Times said that the application of the ceiling premium in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017 reduced the production of premium by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 percent when taking into account inflation.
He said that traffic will again bring profits in other sectors this year, "This loss cannot be sustained with these ceiling prices.
How much more damage can the sector bear?"
Saying that all companies in the sector have 9 billion TL of capital, and that the capital of the sector will be exhausted in three years when only 2.3 billion TL is damaged by traffic, Çağlar said, "Foreigners are asking 'Why is a good driver financing a bad driver, why are my thousands of shareholders financing a bad driver in Turkey?'"
"We're trying to tell Treasury about our problem at this point", he said.
Asked if foreigners have come to the point of reducing the weight in the Turkish insurance sector after these developments, Çağlar said: "They have not yet reached that point".
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, the average rate of 6 policies per person falls, while in Turkey it's 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place to grow up", he said, adding:
So they didn't give up on this.
But even though the company makes a reasonable profit every year, it uses all the profits to grow the company.
According to the TSB data, in 2016 the premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year it was 23.1 billion TL, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
Aglar said he predicted the sector would not complete the year with a 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Social aid to thousands of chronic patients
The details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Aid Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" were revealed, which was launched under the direction of the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya.
The social assistance program for poor citizens and their families will be implemented in the first phase, with 4,300 patients suffering from tuberculosis and SSPE.
Patients will be provided with monthly support over two thirds of the minimum wage and regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also pay additional payments to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical self-care, who are bedridden or who have been diagnosed with tuberculosis at the health unit in need of improving their home living conditions.
Payments will be made via Social Welfare Cards, which will be provided via PTT.
Those who cannot withdraw due to geographical conditions, illness, disability, will be paid at the door.
The program has the distinction of being the first in the world in many ways.
One of the 10 firms that will invest is still German.
Arda Ermut, head of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said that the political tension between the two countries does not reflect the business world.
Ermut used the phrase "in relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We are suffering from this situation and we are fleeing.'"
Ermut: "About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies".
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"Germans are an important part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut said that Abraaj Group's partnership with logistics company Netlog is a good example of this.
Omar Syed, a partner of Abraaj Group, said: "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey".
Ozer, on his way to becoming the last Ottoman
The experienced footballer, who was given two weeks by the management to find the club, is reported to have signed a contract with Osmanlıspor, which he will sign in the coming days.
At the start of last season, he signed a contract with the club until 2019, with 4 hours before the transfer, wearing uniforms in 29 league, 2 cup matches, scoring 5 goals and providing 4 assists.
The management, which blocked the way back to Ozer, agreed to replace this player with Sergio Antonio, the Brazilian, yesterday.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona announced Neymar's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of 222 million euros.
The recent transfer development, which the football community has been following with enthusiasm, has been made official.
PSG has signed the Brazilian player to the Catalan squad for the star's name, paying him 222 million euros, the player's release fee.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history, along with the bonuses.
French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has announced a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
The club's website said that Neymar, 25, who was awarded the world's most expensive player with 222 million euros for the bonuses, signed a contract to play for PSG until 30 June 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to wear the uniform for the French representative, "Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most struggling and ambitious teams".
"I joined my teammates to come to this club and get as many trophies as our fans want".
PSG will pay Neymar 45 million euros each season.
So the cost of the star player will cost the French representative over 400 million euros.
The strike of the sailors is over
The agreement on the extension of the collective agreement between İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company İZDENİZ A.Ş. and the Turkish Seafarers' Union (TDS), affiliated to Türk-İş.
And then, on July 12, union members, the workers of the ZZDENIS, went on strike.
The strike, which lasted almost a month, ended at 3 p.m. today after workers were pushed back.
According to the signed collective agreement, the salary of black personnel in the ZDENIZ will be increased by 12 percent.
The rate of increase for the staff in the status of a sailor increased by 25 percent, with the exemption from Income Tax obtained after the registration of İZDENIZ, which renewed its fleet, to the International Ship Register.
The Directorate General of İZDENİZ announced that flights in the inland bay will continue as normal, with flights to Yassıcaada starting on Tuesday and to Foça and Urla starting next weekend.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir said that the people of Izmir will relax after their strike lasted 23 days.
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to our workers working on land and at sea.
We're happy to leave the table.
On average, 28 percent of the people who work at sea will have a pocket, and 20 percent on land.
We had friends who worked the minimum wage.
We've made a big improvement in their pay.
Nostalgia is coming with "Wild Hot American Summer" and "Partner Detective"
So for the characters' heyday in the '80s, for the grunge era in the '90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for themselves, 2001 before their stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, it's both the embodied and the embodied of our forever-remembered Facebook era.
But in a series, it's like it's out of date.
"First Day of Camp" was an unexpected success, and it wasn't just because of its absurd humor (in it, there was a story about the origins of a talking box plant voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
Focusing on the main comedy (playing middle-aged actors as juvenile children) he realized the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
Now, adult parodies are more casual, including less emotional, adult-themed "Ten Years Later", and monologues about the deviant cult film of the '90s, such as "The Caged Bird Sling".
At one point, the character is mixing up an Apple Powerbook, some single-wheelers and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
Most of the main stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop is now a writer, and he still can't forget Katie.
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy treacherous scheme now being promoted by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black) in which Ronald Reagan (just Mr. Showalter) is involved.
The best part of the series, as usual, is the interviews.
It's especially nice to see Matt Dillon's always young Mr. Rudd with a mustache in "The Bacardians", whose Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, now looks like a grown-up.
It could be random moments of madness that power the series (like the recurring "Seven Up!" series) until I get what I think is the logical outcome: "Wild American Summer: Twenty Years Later", which in the final scene, gets the gang to go see the climax of "Wild American Summer".
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Companion Detective" is referring to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "The Americans", the movie "Blown Bomb", and even "GLOW" with its iconography of East-West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like a found-footage TV drama: a 1980s Romanian police friend drama in which two Bulgarian police officers fight for the real, atheistic and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by Wolf Gregor and the idealist Joseph, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with their English dubbing of their dialogues being done by Channing Tatum (who also serves as executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some good visual comedies (when Americans watch football, cops watch chess on TV)
The famous voice acting crew, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is a good material for the "know who" game.
But "Companion Detective" is so committed to the reality of a blunt propaganda drama (including a Reagan-masked killer), it's often played just like him.
He can't get through six long episodes, and comedy isn't fast enough or often enough.
While Gregor and Joseph frequented the American embassy where two fat men were found eating a bunch of hamburgers like a hungry wolf in their lobby, "Companion Detective" could have better served its propaganda mission if it had been shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn anything into a food to be eaten in series.
The Romanian creators are not wrong, we are doing this to our own past and even to theirs.
FETÖ's father is Kadıanyis
The British government has seen through 50 years of experience that our family is loyal and selfless.
The highest authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has long been committed to the British Government and has rendered great services.
The British government must be wise and careful about this plant, which it has planted with its own hands, to investigate and examine everything carefully and to make a careful decision.
While the FETO is considered the starting point for the organization of the Hashashis, the essential difference is that the FETO emerged in the imperialist era and operated with colonial motives.
I believe the first step to this table is to address women.
In the English praise at the introduction, the person who described himself as 'the seed that the British Government planted with the hands' is Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyanî, the founder of Kadıanîlik.
Ghulam Ahmed, born in Kadyan, a small town in the Indian state of Punjab, reported that on December 1, 1888, Allah had ordered him to take vows from his followers and to form a separate church.
Going a little further, Ghulam Ahmed said that in 1891, according to revelations and inspiration, Jesus died a natural death like the other prophets, and that God sent him as the Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Christians and Muslims.
So the Messiah and the Mahdi that Muslims are waiting for is the same person, Mirza Gulâm Ahmed Kadyanî.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
In India, which came under British rule after the 1857 military uprising, Gullam Ahmed, who wrote books defending Muslims under persecution against Hindus and Christians, recalls the portrait of Gulen defending Islam against idolatry with the Presidency of the Society for Combating Communism in Erzurum, which was believed to have been founded entirely with sanctifying sayings but which later emerged with CIA support.
Like Gülen, Gulâm Ahmed's favourite idea among imperialists is that "jihad" is a struggle for Muslims only to their own selves and that imperialism has no dimension to be fought if you can live your religion freely.
In fact, remember that Gülen went one step further and even praised the Crusader attacks, which still remained open in our history, in a "preaching" last year: "The cross's invasion of your country is not very dangerous.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once they don't touch your wife, your daughter.
They don't touch your temple, they don't touch your cross!
The idea that the Mahdi and the mesihiyah were united in themselves, the idea that his own community would be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad meant only self-struggle, the similarity of the theses to FETÖ, the spread of feminism also took place in education and civil society in general.
The total number of women's centers worldwide, which are said to have over 2 million 'medicine's', is 1869, the number of countries where the humanitarian aid organization Humanity First is officially registered as 23.
It also includes 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 women's printing houses in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and about 16,000 mosques around the world.
If we consider that Prof. Abdusslam, the first Muslim scientist to win the Nobel Prize, Sir Zaferullah Khan, who was the President of the United Nations Court of Justice, and Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to win the Oscar, are also women, we can see more clearly the depth of global power's affection for women.
Let's just note that the women's meeting last week with 30,000 people in England was also shone as a body show.
One of their slogans is "Love everyone, hate no one" and a brief look at their history is enough to understand what Women actually mean by "love your invaders/colonists".
The starting point and motivations of organizations such as the Hulasa, FETO or Tahir-ul Kadri can be traced back to Kadyanis, and all of these organizations are actually supported by the masof to overthrow societies in order to give way to imperialism and serve colonialism.
The last wish came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her final days in a hospital in Washington, D.C., with pancreatic cancer, expressed a longing for a milkshake (milk drink) mixed with coffee and chocolate at a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of the woman's contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, put his drink on dry ice and sent it to a hospital 600 kilometers away with a "quick delivery" cargo, paying a fee of 123 dollars.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul Construction, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba, and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalıkavak, has launched to the market.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by architect Chamoğlu Architecture, was developed to maximize the benefits of the sea.
Dia Mare covers an area of 11,000 square meters and contains a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The roughly completed project will begin delivery to new owners in March 2018.
There are many apartment types in Dia Mare ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company will start two new construction projects in Mimaroba and Bitez this year and in 2018 it is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapı.
He sent 753 million to the allies.
He said that many programs were carried out outside the TRT, where 6,760 personnel work, and that prices were high.
The CHP representative appealed the nation's taxes to AKP companies again at "TRT 2016".
"It's called robbery", he said.
The source TRT is sending to subsidiary production companies, with data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the request of Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş under the Law on Information was to highlight how TRT's resources were spent.
The friend said that in TRT, where 6 thousand 760 people work as personnel, despite all kinds of technical possibilities, 753 million 500 thousand TL were transferred to the partner companies in 2016 through programs carried out under the name of external construction.
The CHP representative used the phrase "This is what it means".
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT".
"Millions are being paid for unknown productions that aren't being watched or filmed".
Recalling that the money transferred to companies was collected from taxes of the people, Yarkadaş said, "The institution with 7 thousand personnel has returned to the arsenal of the AKP".
"What programs did these companies sign up for that 7,000 people couldn't do and they got that money?"
The company reported that its advertising revenue in 2016 was TL 224,456,182, and that the advertising revenue remained a deer's ear when it was taken into account staff salaries and other expenses.
"TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, can't get advertising because it's not being watched".
Food journalists are taking money from TRT, shouting for the AKP.
"But the people are carrying your burden", he said.
CHP's Yarakas continued: "TRT pays staff a salary of TL 660 million per year, but all the work is given to external productions".
753.5 trillion supporters were withdrawn from the people's pocket.
This is a complete joke.
He gave up suicide and knelt before his wife and apologized
The incident happened in a parking lot on Değirmen Street in the Ayupoglu neighborhood this afternoon.
According to the information, the residents of the area reported the situation to the fire and medical teams.
Firefighters at the scene opened the area, while medical teams were waiting.
The 34-year-old father of three, Yunus G, who gave up suicide after nearly an hour of persuasion by the psychologist and police team called to the scene, knelt down in front of his wife N.G. and apologized.
On the other hand, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks in the street where Yunus G. attempted suicide, while some citizens recorded the situation with their cell phones.
Friday messages will be a reminder to friends and family!
What time is Friday prayer?
Friday's messages are still being searched by citizens who will benefit from the day's fees to be sent to their friends and family.
On this day, when the citizens will ask about the time of Friday prayer, the mosques will be open to those who want to do so.
Here are the Friday messages and details of what time of day is Friday prayer.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 percent.
The Bank of England is expected to announce soon that interest rates will remain unchanged after reducing speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slowly" as their interest rates remained stable, as household incomes declined.
The decision-makers in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used 6 to 2 votes to keep interest rates at 0.25%, so they asked for less membership this month after slow economic growth weakened the growing support.
The bank drew its growth forecasts in its quarterly inflation report to 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, and warned that household incomes would continue to shrink with inflation still expected to rise to nearly 3 percent in the spring.
However, he indicated that interest rate increases would be necessary in the next few years to curb Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs could remain higher than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the massive economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it would end its Periodic Funding Plan, which offers low-cost financing to banks, from next February but expects to provide an additional £15 billion (total of £115 billion) under the plan.
The bank said minutes after the interest decision: "MPC's central estimate is that the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) and household real income continues to be a burden on consumption, and is slowly continuing in the short term".
On interest rates, he stressed that "some narrowing of monetary policy" could be necessary to ease inflation and that the market would be "a little higher than expected".
Markets still predict the first growth in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
The bank's forecast for this year's and next year's declining growth is compared to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively, according to the May forecast.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8 percent in 2018.
Sterling has lost value against the dollar and euro since the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to not change came after the latest growth figures, which disappointed the country with 0.2% of GDP in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter, eased the increased growth expectations.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank expects it to start to show a slight increase towards the end of the year.
While the bank says the shortage will worsen before it recovers, the latest inflation report leaves little to be pleased with households hit by rising inflation and short pay rises.
The bank said monetary policy would not "facilitate the hit of incomes" over the next few years, but expects wages to improve "substantially" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The rising demand for British goods due to the weak pound will support the economy by balancing some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock of the pound-down EU referendum vote in August, which saw interest rates cut to 0.25 percent.
The bank predicts that it will likely take four years for this to affect prices and the economy as a whole.
Before the bank's latest interest rate decision, there was a demand for increased inflationary pressure on households in distress and an interest rate hike that was raised by three policymakers in July with a call for a 0.5% increase.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the overrun was about the "totally" weak pound, according to their 2% target.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given recent declines in interest rates, with borrowers demanding a business and a positive year-end, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive.
The market is becoming more popular than ever in re- Mortgage, especially for those nearing the end of their current contracts, with many free options and low interest rates".
NHS will prescribe a controversial HIV cure to 10,000 people
In the High Court, after a struggle over funding the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
The NHS UK announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86 percent in high-risk individuals, will be provided by health services to approximately 10,000 people through a three-year pre-trial trial.
The High Court's decision last year, after the Court of Appeal approved it, agreed to fund the experiment, saying that despite claims by local authorities that the NHS was funding it, it had the power to pay for PrEP.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by Simon Stevens, head of the NHS UK, as a "new and serious intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first publicly registered clinics, with more clinics participating in October and fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a set of HIV medications that reduce the risk of contracting HIV before sex.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough drugs to prevent HIV infection from settling in their body.
These drugs can be taken daily or up to about two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive partners who cannot be successfully treated.
Clinics will select suitable participants from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown individuals whose partners have HIV status controlled with an antiretroviral treatment.
People living in the UK who are registered with a practising physician will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and the NHS UK has signed a deal to provide medicines this week with a proposed international delivery.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, administered, and applied on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to a broad and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
This marks another milestone in thirty years of progress toward overcoming one of mankind's most important health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is targeted correctly at those in need and at risk, it offers the potential to transform the HIV epidemic in the UK.
As of September, people at high risk of HIV will be able to access a new, powerful vehicle that is truly personally controlled and not open to conversation with a spouse through this NHS-funded experiment in the UK, which will lead to many lives improving.
We welcome this message.'
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The first thing we need to do now is to ensure that the trial is delivered nationwide quickly and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP experimental drug has been provided, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We welcome the start of the PrEP trial, and it's been delayed by months of delays and government backlash.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this experiment be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people living with HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in our society.

Two secrets of death
The daughter of former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Chilingiroğlu, born in Washington, Umit Makbule Chilingiroğlu (51) died after falling from the 19th floor of a business center in Istanbul Levent, also used as a hotel.
24-year-old Melis Salihoğlu, a student at Koch University, was found dead in her home.
It was suggested that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
An investigation into two mysterious deaths that were later ruled suicide by police has been launched.
"There Was a Depression"
Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, daughter of Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, the first Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade, who served in the Nihat Erim government in 1971, arrived at Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1, at 17.00.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who lived in a room on the 19th floor and saw the body of Chilingiroğlu, who was not heard from for a while, reported to the hotel management.
The health team determined that Chilingiroğlu died after falling from the 19th floor.
Mediha Chilingiroğlu, who testified to police, said: "He was depressed lately".
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a granddaughter with leukemia from my other daughter.
"He was concerned about my grandson and was adversely affected by his illness", she said.
Chilingiroğlu, whose body was taken to the Forensic Medical Institute, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is being investigated whether Chilingiroğlu was shot or committed suicide.
The purpose of "JANINA KIYDI"
Another suspected death in Istanbul was in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, a student at Koch University, was found dead at his home (24).
The girl's father, who was not able to get word and cell phone calls, allegedly went to her daughter's home near the school.
Dad found his daughter's dead body at home.
It was claimed that Melis, who was much loved by her family, close circle and friends, hanged herself at her home.
The death of Melishoğlu has left his family and relatives drowned.
A friend of Melis's followed on social media, "A bright, bright sun was hitting our face".
We were having fun chasing the green grass under our feet with your best friend Jack and your sister Eishan and that little plastic ball.
He shared the message "What a waste of death now".
Living a luxurious life: The hanging floors and the smart design tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a cozy home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, a real estate restaurateur, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014 to a smaller one.
The Queen Anne-style display is on the first floor of a building and a testament to the new design that Joanne was convinced not to pack.
"I used to live in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex-girlfriend", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that matched my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made her an offer that day".
After the first look, the 1,000-square-foot apartment was renovated from scratch.
It was originally a single-room, complex-plan property, and you had to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, so Joanne wanted to add a storage area and a hanging floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition".
To this end, Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed, a Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio, hired him to take advantage of the 12.5-foot roof and create not only a building but also a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a suspension floor that you could stand inside.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The skeleton is quite complex", he explains.
"We should have arranged the gaps so they could be piled up without having to bend over each other.
It wasn't just a simple platform to build, but the steels would be tilted so that they would be at right heights, according to the upper or lower function".
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas, which allowed Erfan to get two full-sized rooms on top of each other.
An old-fashioned bronze light window from Retrouvius for the suspension floor, overlooks the magnificent living area below.
The gold-glass furniture, the silver accents and the old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all set the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
The mirrors placed at either end of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored security panel in the kitchen gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
The mirrored units in the anthra provide storage for Joanne's entire forklift knife crew and her sniper.
The beauty of the living room, which gives a more splendid sense of space, is that it can close the kitchen when it's not in use.
It's open and closed. Kitchens are not new.
The unique thing about this is that it's a garage-style door that can be lifted up.
Erfan explains the steel-reinforced polished MDF door, "We used some engineering on this".
"It's a weight of balance, so when you push the door up, it slides really easily".
With the clever use of the space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square feet, an additional bedroom, and an improved seating plan.
"At the end of the day, it's about selling the living space or setting the value of your property", says Erfan.
"As a claimant, a realtor will enter and perform a calculation on the seating area".
They managed to use high-quality materials to increase the floor area here, giving the area a luxurious look.
"Materials are the things you touch", says Erfan, "and thus help you to make an emotional connection at home".
"You don't fall in love with the power lines on the walls at home.
These are important, but your heart's wires will not shake".
This is proof that, with good design and increased square footage, an apartment can turn from something standard into something pretty awesome.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens with the bonservice in Beşiktaş
At the end of the 1.5 month negotiations, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with the Lens bonservice, which was initially considered to be rented.
After a week of intense negotiations, Lens has agreed to a contract with the black and white team for a bonus of 5 million euros.
It's been reported that the Dutch player, who has a five-year deal, will receive 2.2 million euros a year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement regarding Jeremain Lens' transfer.
Wedding photos of famous couples
Model Çağla Şikel, who has been in a relationship for almost four years, and actor and singer Emre Altuğ, entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony with a photograph they called "the most special moment of our lives".
The couple decided to split up after seven years.
The brothers are fighting for a $500 million estate empire.
Forty years after the family was founded by Italian families, the two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, former Carlton Football Club director and contractor, lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has presented himself to the Supreme Court on how to divide property and business assets.
Paul had wanted to quit the family business since 2014, but the breakup was still hotly debated in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in the property, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractor sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
Under a deal with his deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as "a major driving force and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns one-third.
One court filing says that means Colin has $316 million in assets and Paul has $176 million in assets.
For Paul, the division of property and cash is a contentious issue.
In his first affidavit to the court in 2015, he wrote: "Colin's proposed divisions left him with the property I always considered to be the best".
Last Friday, after a series of failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers also have a fight over who will control the current work, with Paul claiming Colin left him out of the job.
Colin insists this isn't true, but he accuses Paul of mismanaging some of his property.
Colin said in an affidavit he initially swore he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority".
The costs in the case are rising along with hundreds of page affidavits, emails, and senior legal advisers from top lawyers like Allan Myers, QC, and both sides, recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who operated department stores and shops from the late 1950s onwards, and in the early 1970s they had bought a store in Brunswick.
They had taken their property hostage to buy the Collingwood estate where Colin opened the family's first coat-pants shop.
Colin says that he founded Westco there "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young boy (at the age of 10).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave their belongings to their sons in a friendly way.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted brothers to go to court", he wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutyis group of companies, and Colin says that when he left, Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million.
Paul says that both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial separation".
According to the 2015 biography of television star's best friend, Eddi McGuire, Colin tried to avoid attention despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin just texted me and said, "I can't say anything about the classroom because the case is in court".
"It was very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family name to court", she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he was trying to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to have a dispute", she said, adding that "he is still hopeful about the solution".
On Friday, it seems that hope is gone.
Colin wrote, "Our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future".
Trump's new private pen is planning to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If it does, it'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House private pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), in the hope of keeping his boss more stable.
Here's a little bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House private investigator John F. Kelly met with senior staff on his first day in office, he summarized a key problem President Donald Trump was planning to solve with the White House: the passing of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through the paper or through briefings, because the president would be able to make better decisions when given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis sounds very meaningful, but others tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's now in the White House, and his TV watching skills are still good.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, "If Aida Trump was upset that she wasn't fairly involved in the media, it would be more productive to show her that she was fairly involved in persuasive media outlets".
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption contained a steady stream of praise".
I'll be right back.
But it's ridiculous that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time.
Maybe these campaigners know something the rest of us don't, like Trump's tweets would be much more provocative if they didn't intervene.
We'll probably never know about any tweets Trump didn't send.
If his men were able to get him out of harm's way a few times, then it was worth the effort.
But no one could stop Trump from continuing to create controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of rival factions, people who were trying to advance their agendas with the materials they presented to Trump (which could be reliable or unreliable) and promoted their worldviews.
In May, Politico reported that throughout the story, advisers had a tendency to strategically communicate suspicious information to the president.
Here's an example, as reporter Shane Goldmacher explained in detail:
"Today's and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted angrily to negative news stories from the press, especially the leaks that have a bad impact, and is busy finding out where they come from.
This happened in late February when someone corrupted the president, Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, by giving away a printed copy of an article accusing private pen assistant Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn't matter that Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he didn't provide any concrete evidence, or that he made false accusations in the past and turned away from them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh to the staff".
Goldmacher added that the then private pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "tryed to install a system that handled and documented the documents Trump received".
What was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own momentum and his aides are still competing for influence.
These variables will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Crypto FETÖ's clients have been revealed with a special template
The Prosecutor of the Republic of İzmir Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation initiated by the Chief of Staff of the Naval Command, General General General Cihat Yayci, who said that the secret witness code "Sarmaşık" was FETÖ. "
The study highlighted that while General Publici was not an organization member, he helped the investigation authority in decrypting the members of the crypto organization in the Naval Command and played an active role in fighting FETO.
The decision, which indicated that the publisher was trying to pacify the coup attempt on July 15, under the so-called strict order of the Commandant of the Marine Forces, noted that the publisher had been actively fighting FETÖ since the first day of the coup attempt.
The decision of Karakaya to not follow up was made: "It is understood that the distributor has been working on the identification of personnel of the Maritime Command of the Crypto Naval Forces through a special template for identifying FETÖ members belonging to the crypto-private services class and a special system created over 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria".
The court has decided that it is impossible to evaluate the Prosecutor's assessment based on his speculative efforts, which are known to be active anti-terrorist organization and have made great contributions to this direction.
Admiral Beaucoutier was previously tried for blasphemy.
It turned out that the FETO were behind it again and that the alleged crime was a compass.
Colonel Hakan Dinç, a former Air Pilot, who complained that the publisher insulted him, turned the complaint into a document in the form of an information note.
Air Base Commander Pilot Tuggeneral Bekir Ercan Van, former Adviser to the General Directorate General General Al-Koseh, former Intelligence Chief of the General Directorate General, Colonel Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Ağı, former Marine Captain Necmettin Aksoy, who gave the dismissal authorization, former Judge Captain Akif Us and former Judge Lieutenant Serdar Chamichi and former witness Yaycici were deported from the TSK due to their ties with FETÖ.
Some members of the organization, including FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opchin, were targeted by the publisher with their social media posts before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
Travelers crossed the trench, returned to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest housewives in the West Midlands are once again fighting with determined travelers who have crossed the council-excavated ditch to reclaim the space outside their homes.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans outside a area known as the "rich neighborhood" of Solihull, which was once the street where the city was located.
They returned from the trench that the council had dug to cut their flows, with horses, babies and a full cargo cart, just after being fired in May.
The clever group found a gap in the defense, leaking their vehicles through a barricaded section of the road.
Angry residents have criticized the Solihull Council, saying it is "useless in solving the problem".
An unnamed resident said: "After being sent off from Bentley Heath, they came there on Monday evening.
He should be ashamed of the council's actions because they're useless in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, sent out, and now they're back again.
More came last night, and probably more will come today".
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with its long-term removal decisions to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes when the council can't even stop this.'
One resident who declined to give his name said: 'Just as a joke, we saw the last group of travelers leave and were soon devastated by a new group.
This time, the numbers had increased and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorised camp on the grounds of Streetsbrook Street, and we are launching the necessary legal proceedings to send them away as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it's important that as many residents as possible call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help to bring the picture of the situation to the attention of the court when we bring our case to court.'
Galatasaray reported the indiaye to the stock exchange
According to a statement sent to the Borsa Istanbul by Galatasaray Sporting Tests and Commercial Investments, the yellow-red club will pay Osmanlıspor 7 million 500 thousand euros for the player's bonservis fee, if he plays a total of 25 matches in the league, cup and Europe, 750 thousand, if he plays 50 more matches, 750 thousand euros.
Galatasaray will pay a total of 11 million euros of guarantee fee to Ndiaye, which has signed a four-year contract, for each year of 2 million 750 thousand euros.
In addition, Ndiaye will be awarded a €5,000 bonus for each point the yellow-red team will receive in matches played in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
The statement also announced that the player has the unilateral right to terminate the contract for 18 million euros from 15 June 2019.
Last day of the week!
They rushed to the fire station.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in the storm and fog that hit Istanbul last Thursday.
While most drivers who reported the fire to insurance companies to cover the damage made their reports, drivers who had not reported to date also lined up for the report.
Drivers who were not wearing helmets today came to the fire station to report because it was the last day of the alert period.
Today is the last day
The drivers first took pictures of their vehicles to the fire department to determine the damage to their vehicles.
The drivers who were damaged in their vehicles later reported to the authorities.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've got a recording and I'm going to take a picture".
When I came in, there was a lot of activity.
"There was damage to the windshield", he said.
Driver Erbil Sword, "We came to run to run".
We're in line.
We took the picture.
"Now we'll wait for the report", he said.
The skyscrapers with the sea and the land walls are breathless
CHP Member of Parliament Nadir Ataman issued an earthquake warning about the giant structures rising on the coast, saying: "The billy report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of 6 magnitude".
It is said that the stumps, which are 25-30 meters below the solid rock, were not dug that deep.
Istanbul Ataköy high-rise hotels and residences that built a wall between the sea and land on the coast have left the district breathless.
Member of the Assembly of Bakırköy Municipality of CHP Nadir Ataman reacted to the giant AVM, hotel and residence projects that are rising one after another in the county.
He noted that the wind-cutting of the structures on the coast, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind formed the Atatürk Forest in Floria.
80 years later, a concept of urbanism was reached, and they built giant skyscrapers in the windy corridors and changed the climate.
"He's not breathing in the air", she said.
He added that the buildings that rise like walls on the Ataköy coast change the balance of the climate: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the glaciers".
These buildings must be built in the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the windy corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures are disrupting the natural balance of life.
He said that these skyscrapers, which are harmful to the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of the people of Bakırköy to the sea.
Hair loss can be treated without surgery.
The success rate of phenol application is 83%.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue gap is filled with an agent that kills the hair roots.
Another treatment for hair loss without surgery is laser treatment.
The various lasers are used to burn the hair roots and surrounding tissue by means of circular rays, which in the process of burning the tissue sticks together.
These two non-surgical methods of hair loss help patients return to their social and work lives in a shorter time.
Dr Mert Atak, who noted that excessive weight, idle life, sitting for long periods of time, working, heavy hair and body hair and not complying with hygiene rules caused hair to turn, said that symptoms of the disease included tail entry pain, infection, apnea and swelling.
Italy is hardening the approach of STKs to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned the STKs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue unless they comply with the new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa, "If the STKs do not comply with the new regulations, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate".
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by German aid organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actively cooperating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has been active for only a year, declined to comment on the details of the charges brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement on social media: "Saving human lives is our top priority and will be, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue area at this time".
"We can only assess the allegations made at this time after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation".
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of having boarded a boat full of rubber boats delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allowed the smugglers to escape on boats for reuse.
According to prosecutor's files, published by Italian media, at least one such encounter allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard who oversees rescue operations in the area for more than any other human effort.
The regulations said that a ship like Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on deck to clearly monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine STKs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the regulations: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Tuesday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious change or obstacle" to his rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue in recent weeks was a sign of the efforts to strengthen Libya's coastal security and the fruitful cooperation with local governors.
"We've been seeing light at the end of the tunnel lately", the minister said.
This month, he announced plans to hold further talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in the hope of reaching Europe.
The last minute punch!
In Moscow, the Russian capital, the "Day of the Paratroopers" was celebrated with a drink of vodka eaten with squash as every year.
Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who was a participant in the activity and a Russian Gorky Park live broadcaster who drank too much alcohol, was attacked.
The reporter, who was broadcasting the news of the day, warned the man who suddenly appeared and cursed, "We will occupy Ukraine".
The drunk man, who was said to be a former paratrooper, punched him hard at the reporter's warning.
The reporter, who was punching him, tried to get away from him.
Millions of people watched the shock live.
Economic Coordination Board is convened
The Economic Coordination Council (ECC) was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Shimshek.
The first meeting of the ECK, held under the presidency of Shimsheq after the change of cabinet, began at 18.30 in Chankaya Köşkü.
The meeting will discuss Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
The meeting was attended by Shimsheq's Finance Minister Naji Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Deputy Osman Çelik, President of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and other relevant bureaucrats.
You can get rid of the rib cage in 45 minutes.
Dr. Oğuz Karaeminoğlu, who noted that only 5 percent of patients need surgery for pelvic inflammation, said: "According to the results of the examination and imaging of the patient, the first step is rest and medication treatment".
In particular, in the patient group where pain continues, the intervention methods (e.g. epidural injection, radio frequency techniques, intra-disk procedures) should be tried, he warned, "If all these methods are not successful, if numbness and weakness in the legs are difficult to detect, then surgery becomes available".
Karaeminoğlu said that 'full closed pelvic surgery' which reduces the risk today also allows patients who cannot get results with the initial methods to reduce their fears about surgery, and that it is possible to get rid of pelvic disease in 45 minutes:
Although the results are quite good compared to microscopic surgery and open surgery, some complications can be encountered, such as a long recovery period after surgery, sticky spinal cord, recurrence of the fungus, and later development of spinal cord swelling and infection.
Microscopic surgery is often described as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is also practiced in the same manner as open surgery.
And with a fully closed pelvic floor surgery, the risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissue is preserved.
The full-closed hip surgery only takes 45 minutes.
Special commissioner of the business
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Friend and High Discipline Board Member Turan Aydoğan.
Commission, Berberoğlu on 4 October
He will also follow his trial in the Criminal Court and his appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeal.
In the letter of mandate, signed by CHP General Secretary Kamil Okyay Sındır and Deputy General President Bülent Tezcan, "The independence and impartiality of the party, the absence of orders from anywhere other than the law, is an indispensable condition of justice".
"Our national representative, Mr. Enis Berberoğlu, did not demand any special status while doing his duties as a parliamentarian, did not seek refuge in the immunity armor recognized by his parliament, and wanted to maintain his belief in the independence and neutrality of the judiciary".
It was suggested that the trial process prefers the court to apply political orders rather than the trial.
The letter argued that the arrest decision was given before the verdict was finalized despite the Constitutional Court's decisions that MPs found the arrests wrong, which was clear evidence that the court had ruled under the influence.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texting and phone conversations.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years of legal parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the kidnapping and murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at the hearing Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was granted leave to appeal.
Although he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, his legal team has claimed that both he and Mr. Roy suffer from mental illness.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream blouse, was in the penalty with his eyes wide open, his hands wrapped and his eyes staring down.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy".
He ended her life to heal yours.
He didn't accept responsibility".
"He never showed any remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible situation that he regretted completely".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not see "any significant influence on the actions of his age, maturity level, or even mental illness".
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There is not a day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I've been through everything, and I'm trying to be with her sisters with all the pain we'll carry forever".
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, has expressed "unconscious" the reality that her brother will never attend the wedding or that he will never be able to continue to have children.
"The fact that you've been with me every day since I was born is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life".
Since there's no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell someone to kill themselves, it looks like a lawsuit will create a conspiracy.
Mr. Roy was 17 when Carter was found dead in a car from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter's brief messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While on vacation with her family, she wrote in a series of messages two weeks before her death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways".
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz instructed the press not to allow him to profit from this case, saying Carter wanted to draw attention to Mr. Roy's death.
The case divided their legal views.
Among the minority who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, published a controversial article in the Los Angeles Times, saying: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison".
The growth forecast from Mehmet Shimshek
In his statement, Shimsheq said that inflation in Turkey should be reduced to low single-digit figures and that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his lightning speech , he said:
The next 12 months are critical to reducing uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a powerful government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope the uncertainties in our near geography will be reduced.
I believe that by improving our resistance to shocks with some reforms, we will put Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
The worst is behind us.
Slowly, we're not going to focus our energy on those areas, but on reforms that will bring about inclusive growth, job growth...
So the next 12 months are critical.
Reform, on the one hand, is a reduction in uncertainty, and there is no political uncertainty.
I hope we'll have a better chance and the problems in our geography will be reduced.
Whether we like it or not, many of our classic markets are in shambles.
Like Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing markets, we're facing a wave of more than 3.5 million immigrants.
Looking back over the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, we have solid foundations.
Now, with some reforms, we're going to increase our resistance to shocks, and some more of the question marks in investors' heads, and we're going to put Turkey back in a growth policy of over 5 percent.
Let me be honest, I'm from here, we have such a generous retirement system.
I think it's reasonable to say that our pension companies aren't doing enough.
Once the car is in the mix, the performance will be strong.
Why? Why?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go out and spend money.
We've been watching these concerns, and we've been thinking about how we're going to allocate global assets to what investment areas, given the poor performance.
You know, the revenue is high.
Once clearly, there's going to be a performance there, in addition to the 25% that the state gives.
And the rest of it is on the Treasury, which is usually a low risk.
I think you'll be more interested in the next few years as we look at the big picture.
Because they're gonna see the performance.
It's not a failure in another area, it's a success.
We restructured the BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, there's a savings of 70 billion.
Give it up. The system's working.
There are 2.6 million participants in the automatic event and 775 million pounds of savings.
We're asking for a little more effort from the companies.
Let them advertise, tell us about the system.
We're working on bail.
Maybe we can just relax him a little bit...
We'll see, we'll work.
Maybe citizens see the return, see the accumulation, and stay in the system.
The system's out of the system is 38 percent.
Almost half of those who left were voluntary individual retirees.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing? !
You're out of the car.
We were actually expecting a drop of about 10 percent.
And that means we're very optimistic.
Once the system is up.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies are one-sided sometimes.
They've increased their premiums so fast.
When we asked why, they said the court's decisions didn't take into account the current regulations.
We've made a new setup.
We told you to do what you had to do.
They said, "No, we'll wait for the verdict".
We said it wouldn't be like this.
We have a disagreement here.
Of course, when it comes to this ceiling premium, some companies have turned it down.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risky insurers.
Let me say this, let me say it again.
I prefer to have this system run through competition.
I mean, I don't think these ceiling pricing practices are right, they forced us to.
I'd like to see it in three dimensions.
Consider the system we're building.
Two, the system works normally, a price tag on that track.
In addition, the burden is heavy, and almost 30 to 31 pounds of every 100 pounds of premium paid goes to tax cuts.
I'm working right now, so we're gonna talk to our finance minister.
And third, technology is evolving rapidly.
Traffic accidents will also decrease substantially over time, structurally.
But it's a mandatory road insurance policy.
The headline of "SABAH" saved your leg
Buerger's disease, which began in adolescence, was once a male disorder but has now become more common in women.
One of these women is Mehtap Dursun, 36.
The pain started two years ago and has become chronic in the base of the foot.
When the young woman, who was struggling to walk, faced the risk of losing her leg, she walked around the hospital.
A friend of his suggested Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The headline of SABAH showed the news 'Azerbaijan Minister of Emergency Situations saved the life'.
It turned out that Dursun, who was on his way to Kalko, was battling Buerger's disease.
Professor Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman to the emergency room.
Dursun, who recovered from his pain shortly after, is now undergoing oxygen therapy.
Audi to modify 850,000 diesel vehicles as carmakers face backlash
A day before Audi announced it was offering software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the board of BMW said he believed BMW had "more smart options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW's headquarters (where diesel vehicles are being banned or restricted) are being considered.
Daimler said Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe would modify their diesel emissions.
None of the firms described these moves as recall.
European carmakers had strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to neutralize diesel exhaust is also increasing, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
While German automakers faced scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was accused of defrauding powerful car companies and ignoring the issues.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes by hiding that it uses a device known as a deception device and adjusting emissions to meet regulations when a car is tested and loosening it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in the engine development department of Audi, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year Audi was drawn into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, which expanded the United States-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive share of Volkswagen's profits.
Don 't jump fishing every time you see it .
The President of the Turkish Nöroşirürji Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Shukru Çağlar, warned against jumping to shallow places of 2 meters.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of stroke due to neck fractures and spinal cord injuries from diving in shallow water.
Neck fractures usually occur in the 5 or 6" spine.
The characteristic feature of fractures is that at this level they affect the muscles of the arms and legs as well as the nerves that supply the respiratory muscles.
"In these types of accidents, the most valuable organ of the spine, the spinal cord, is cut by the fractured spine or becomes disfunctional by compressing".
"If you get a spinal cord injury, the wrong first aid can not only increase the damage in accidents but also lead to death", he said.
Diving is the fourth leading cause of spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20 to 29, and most of them are male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Fishing in invisible waters is not allowed".
"The more deep you dive, the more serious you can get", he said.
Prof. Dr. Aglar also recalled:
Depending on the level of spinal cord damage caused by the injury during fishing, different degrees of paralysis can occur in the arms and legs.
You may know how to swim, but water can be tricky.
What seems to be deep to you may be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, the use of warning signs on the shores of the sea has reduced the number of shallow-water fishing jumps by 70 percent.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Though Turkey has a seaside of 28 years, unfortunately, there is not a single warning sign outside Istanbul".
"In the case of these life-threatening accidents, every year before the summer, the health department, schools and social awareness projects need to have a noticeable display of information lights or information boards on the beaches and pools".
The head of the group of spinal and peripheral nerve surgeons of the TÜRK Neurosurgeon Association, Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, suggested:
We need to call 112 as soon as possible.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, and determined with a firm grip.
The patient must be laid on the opposite side to drain the water into the lungs.
It should not be held by the legs and suspended to drain water.
No attempt should be made to correct the deformity of the patient's neck.
The neck spine may be broken.
However, if the spine is not yet damaged, an inappropriate position to be placed around the neck during first aid and patient transport can cause fractured bone to press on the spine and cut and damage.
Provence lavender is under threat from climate change
It became a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat from climate change.
Lawn declines due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small ostrich, a leaf-borne pest that carries microbacteria, and in very dry weather there are many of them".
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much lavender oil as holidaymakers for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "While we should have very long plant buds with a few broad flowers, we have smaller, less developed or no or weak buds.
So we have less essential oil".
The solutions included better water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, but also spraying a protective clay and water mixture on plants and developing more drought-resistant species.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review the latest riots sparked by organized crime in Sinaloa state, corrupt officials and plans for the newspaper's ever-ending drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedies, they gathered to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office where a 2009 bomb was targeted, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutral, allies.
They want reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and voices are enough.
Journalists suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, politicians, business people, government or cartels, are the bad guys who make the mess of Mexico dangerous to write in the paper.
While there is no violence, the number of dead bodies is increasing across the country, even more of these are journalists: According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 people have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven have died so far this year in seven states.
Among the recent dead are the managers of the creative works and inspiration of Riodoce's founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez writes in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph showing Valdez' middle finger hanging on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice", with two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smile, his glassy face and his signature Panama cap.
The work takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters talk about his shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it prosecuted only two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, despite their broken hearts, the ground is now more deceptive, they insist on mentioning the violence in Sinaloa.
Without knowledge of the killers, without justice, without security consultation, Ibarra says, it's very little use.
"It's stupid to waste my time on this", he says.
"Unless we know why, you don't trust anyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
The red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before being stopped by two men; it was forcibly removed from its vehicle and shot 12 times, about to be translated as the Twelfth River, for the name of its newspaper.
The gunman got in her car and ran away, and hit the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He's left with his wife and two grown children.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to be free.
But there's almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States, rival groups have been fighting to fill the void, and Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country.
Let Sinaloa's streets be filled with murders of one or more people every day, or the cemetery filled with more murals than many of the finer, more elaborate, two-story houses the drug kings could live in.
Forget the "quiet" situation that only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this and despite Valdez's deep awareness of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's founding partner and CEO Ismail Bojorquez (60), was overwhelmed with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, a February issue featured an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups at war with Guzman's sons.
This article may have infuriated the sons, who were likely gang members who bought every copy of the print to be distributed to the newspapermen.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper containing the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in the Mexican-based violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long, his friends and coworkers assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five colleagues in selling $50 shares in the disclosure of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to do journalism in Sinaloa without talking about drugs", Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for its bold and honest news, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and readers were immersed in a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to report.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for journalism in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage to stand up for the Mexican drug story wherever it ends.
He admitted he was scared.
At the CPJ Awards, he said, "I want to live".
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life".
"You have to accept your job as a journalist, you're either playing this or you're playing the fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was happening?'"
The staff at Riodoce misses Valdez, the blasphemous joker, his generous friends, his hugs and advice, his teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar called El Guayabo across the street from his office and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask, did his love for routine fall?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and survive.
"If you're dealing with their wives and children, their clean work, their secret airstrip for drug trafficking, they don't like it".
Bojorquez said, "These things were over the top".
The result was a high degree of autocensorship and self-defense, even at its best.
Trusting your own instincts.
If there's any bad smells, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, director of creative writing at Riodoce, said, "It's a feeling that can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that host weak institutions and corrupt government officials, there are no lucrative smuggling routes that are a mix of poisoning and...
The floor is changing all the time.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training, as it turned out days ago that spyware sold only to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside tried to escape the 104 degrees, in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-assed, half-serious, some reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself said were not reliable.
Reporters have been going to the hilly countryside where the drug gangs are effectively in control for months.
In this week's issue, Riodoce is working on three main stories.
Former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had his brother murdered in Sinaloa.
And there was also the revelation of the governor's concentrated government spending on his homeland.
And a group of people were kidnapped at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official explanation as to who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew, the restaurant was the target of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated almost every stage of politics for the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter at the scene to write about previous events, including the escape of one of Guzman's sons from a military raid.
They'd only read months ago, looking around Valdez's corner for the best source of information on the kidnapping.
Villareal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his thin structure, said: "We already knew what they were like before".
"All communication channels with our resources are now cut off".
The staff is transformed into something unexpected, activists on behalf of the press, while Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and displays protesting the murder of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some posters and went to the local prosecutor's office for another reporter the next morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was found, and DNA tests indicate that it was him.
Journalists across the country have been expressing their thoughts louder in organized protests, writing "Help His Father" on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case in remote Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked to be assigned to a job other than reporting to the government, thinking that his anger was breaking his neutrality.
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, accomplices, officials and a careless society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that journalists are killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and law enforcement.
Ramirez said, "You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you".
The murders clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in Tamaulipas, the northern border state.
The body was found with a note said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news".
A computer keyboard and headset, serial next to his severed head.
Some publications, such as El Norte, preferred to close after the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March in the northern border state of Chihuahua.
After their managers were killed in 2004, others continue as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo did.
In 2010, the headline of the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own states, even their own country.
It's a tough decision.
In exile, they are hard to find work and still search the streets in anticipation of danger.
Sometimes they are captured, apparently from photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015, three months after escaping Veracruz.
It's a dance that happens every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and keep working.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter".
On a recent Saturday, midnight, while preparing for the final issue, the Riodoce editorial directors were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer, and at the same time their phones were ringing.
A series of armed clashes, involving rival gangs and security forces, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths near Mazatlan, a beach resort.
As promised in a series of cartel messages around, the war was still raging.
They put the news on the Riodoce website via cell phones at the summit.
The front page was supposed to be changed the next day.
Sirens are ringing nearby, there's another gunshot in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly checked the police officers who were guarding to see if they were alert.
They wouldn't show up if they were scared.
Under the giant portrait of the founder of their newspapers, his middle finger was displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, and Riodoce's crew was following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing", said Bojorquez, "the day Javier was killed, when the intern asked me to send him out to the street to report to me?"
He used camouflage to avoid his enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
The researchers now explain that the first finds of an incredible creature the size of a giant beetle found by a Canadian miner are very well preserved, which experts describe as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the pulp was reddish brown and had a "problematic past".
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered node-type that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago, from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
Its exceptionally well-preserved condition has surprised researchers who describe it as "truly wonderful".
The plant-eating armor is the best preserved fossil of its kind found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while excavating the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that looked strange from the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild beast from within the 2,500-pound (1100-kg) cluster of land.
After so much hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display, said, "If you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe it's asleep".
"One of the most beautiful and best-preserved species of dinosaur in the history of science, it will go down as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
Researchers examined its skin and found that although it was covered with armor and resembled a moving tank, the carnivorous plant was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and a protective technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts suggest that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, which allowed it to better interfere with its surroundings and overcome its enemies.
The 110 million-year-old node-owned creature first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
The researchers have now completed their work and named the wild beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to uncover it.
The exceptional preservation of the species has allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the design and shape of the seals and the armor on the body.
They discovered the counter shadow, a common defense in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature is darker from the bottom.
Although the contra-shading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds the contra-shading animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is sufficiently pressured and hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, and evolution prefers to face hiding as a survival method.
But the most modern animals using counter shading (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and more likely to become prey, meaning that this node has had a serious difficulty surviving.
"The strong hunting of a heavily armored animal shows just how dangerous dinosaur predators on Crete can be", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the seeds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about life, including its preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was dragged into the sea, where it sank to the surface of the ocean.
Alberta at the time was as warm as South Florida today, and probably rivers and oceans were more inland than they are now.
"It's really remarkable that the nodosaur is completely covered and protected by fur, but also that the original shape of the animal is also preserved in 3D", Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it did in early Crete.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you close your eyes a little, you can even believe it's almost asleep.'
Cretaceous was the time when giant theropods, two-legged flesh-eating dinosaurs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by a group of formidable ancestors.
Among these is Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, 6-ton monster.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after its death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while excavating the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including its skin and armor, and it's perfect from nose to hip.
The creature averages about 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two horns, 20 inches long, come out of her shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armoured herb roamed the area that is now Western Canada until it was swept into the open sea by a river that flowed through the valley.
But the dinosaur's undersea tomb has preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossil remains of this particular species have been so well preserved that the leather fragments still cover the spiny armor layers along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, a conservative of this degree "is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at her, the more incredible she becomes.
The fossilized skin fragments still cover the spotted armour layers of the dinosaur's skull.
He's got his right front leg lying next to him, five fingers up.
I can count the stamps on the bottom of your feet".
Don 't be so mean when you say I 'm whitening
White teeth and a beautiful smile is everyone's dream.
While people are using various methods to whiten their teeth, Nukhhet Berk, president of the Association of Oral Laser Applications, warns against products sold in stores or online.
Noting that these types of substances are sold, they draw the surface of the mine, and the teeth are stained in a way that is not recycled again, Nükhet Berk says, "whitening of the teeth can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of the teeth, such as nail polish".
Berk noted that the protection of dental health prevents the development of many diseases and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health, allowing both dental and dental health and a beautiful smile.
Teens usually have white teeth unless there is a defect or genetic factor in the structure of their teeth.
Due to ageing, tooth decay, and frequent use of cigarettes, corrosive or dark-colored beverages, teeth become darker over the years.
Dental whitening can be achieved by applying chemicals applied by dentists or by applying thin, adhesive porcelain surfaces such as nail polishes to the surface of the teeth without minimal or no decomposition.
Never whiten your teeth with products sold in stores or on the Internet.
Because these substances paint the surface of the mine, staining the teeth so that they can never be recycled.
Since 2011, the Municipality of Keçiören has been providing "Home Dental and Oral Health Services" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens.
Koxal Gungor, 65, who has been confined to bed for 24 years in Keçiören's Wake Up neighborhood, said: "My husband has heard about this service of Keçiören Municipality".
We called the city, they came right away.
"I'm already paralyzed from the neck down, and thanks to this service, I'm not neglecting dental care".
The daughter of Gulizar Taşçıoğlu, 72, who lives in Pınarbaşı neighborhood, Kezban Gökçe, said: "My mother has been bedridden for 7.5 years due to her old age.
When I got to town, I saw the posters for this service and called right away.
We've been regularly receiving this service for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the words "very pleased".
No health insurance is required for the service, which is completely free.
"Old man" in the Turkish army
My dear readers, at the meeting of the High Military Council (YAŞ) the previous day, very interesting decisions were taken, especially in terms of the Navy.
This force was brought to command not an oramiral, but a coramiral.
It's practically unheard of in our military.
How did that happen?
Commander of the force, Major Bulent Bostanoğlu, has served his term, and he was already retiring...
And it was.
Now the command was given to Veysel Kösele, the only Oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who was a former compass victim and had been detained for a while, was supposed to be a commander in the normal senior ranks.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to be very brief, but if we start at the top of the Navy, commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 are not promoted.
In that case, there was only one remaining admiral in the Navy.
He was supposed to be brought to the vacant post, Navy Commander Oramiral Veysel Kösele, number two.
And then what happened?
The sixth ranking Adnan Özbal was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Oramiral Veysel Kessel is standing there, but he's being replaced by a commander of a lower rank!
A senior is being put under your senior's command.
I wonder what happens next.
A ranking admiral cannot and will not serve under a ranking corporal.
He doesn't take orders from him, he doesn't.
In this case, Veysel Kossele will not tolerate this painful situation, if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the annoying message from the government to him: "Goodbye Veysel Pasha!"
The news of his resignation was circulated in the afternoon of yesterday when I wrote this post, but the situation was not officially disclosed.
Now let's go back to what happened!
The government opposed Veysel Kosele for one reason or another, forced him to resign and brought a 6th-ranked guard to the command instead, violating the traditional concept of "Kidem" of our army.
There's definitely politics involved, but we don't know what's behind the scenes.
Maybe soon, if someone tells us, we'll all learn together!
My dear readers, I have tried to describe it very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority event is very important.
Not just as an officer.
For example, an officer who graduated 10th in the Army's Military Academy is older than an officer who graduated 11th.
A first-class general is older than a second-class general.
We've seen concrete examples of this seniority in the Battle of the Bulge.
The Garp Front commander is Ismet Pasha...
You have two armies under your command.
Army and Army 2.
We're in 1922, our armies will launch a major offensive and drive out the Greek army.
There are some valuable names that are expected to be appointed to the army command at this stage.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He's offered command of the army, but he says, "I'm a senior, I can't be in his command".
Another name is Jacob Chevki (Morning) Pasha.
Atatürk's teacher at the War Academy...
A noble and distinguished commander whom he loved and cherished, whom he called "Master", who fought in various battles.
In 1919, he was captured by the British along with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and deported to the island of Malta.
When he returns home, he is reluctant to say the same thing about the army command: "The commander of the Western Front is inferior to me, I cannot take orders from him".
But Ataturk convinces him to thank him and Jacob Shevki Pasha accepts command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali is the one who is the most powerful.
A very talkative, constantly critical soldier.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.
He is being deported to Malta by the British, escaping there and coming to Ankara via Kusadas.
When he was offered the command of the army, Ali Ihsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight under the command of Ismet, who is inferior to me"...
But he's convinced...
But come on, after he's taken office, he's constantly arguing with his Garp front commander, Ismet Pasha, making a mess and disturbing the army...
And shortly before the big attack, he's being dismissed and retired, replaced by the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali Ihsan Pasha never gets along with Ataturk.
The issue of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war but also in peace.
Of course he has to go.
Veysel Kosel is the last example of this.
How did an activist find out the answer to the question "Who's on the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was devastated.
The day after he came to New York City to go on a stroll, the St. Louis native sat in the bed of an Airbnb he rented and started browsing Facebook on his phone.
It was a high school guy's share.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street".
She was surprised to find that no one else shared this information in the content stream, so she shut down Facebook and started Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah was constantly re-tweeted on his content stream.
Rapper from the St. Louis area tweeted live the death of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot dead by an unarmed black, white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's serial corpse on the street, which will stay there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "That's wild".
But death was not new to him or his people.
He left his phone later that evening to return to tweets about a crowd gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were police tapes, screaming people, and photos of a man holding a banner that said he was Brown's father, and it said, "The Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
A police officer was watching a live broadcast with a barking dog standing in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another cop, he said, pulled his rifle trigger and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals".
Ferrell remembered saying, "This is not unusual".
"'This is not the type of murder we're used to and typical of it.'
I was terrified.
I was angry and I was crying".
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he took his 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary coming to theaters on August 11, "Who's on the Streets?"
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the perspective of the people who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
As Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with his daughter in a floral dress and a crown that suited her, they returned that morning to a conversation they had repeatedly had earlier about "black experiences and the condition of blacks".
"Remember I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?"
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that wasn't true.
I couldn't resist taking it". Ferrell said later.
"What is happening here today is a consequence of what happened in the past.
He needs to know, see, and grow up in it.
Not only must we be well-rounded in activism and organizing, but we must also know the layers of the black experience and the black state and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
If I were lucky enough to give her an experience that she would not personally experience, she would be no different than any black woman or child.
I feel like I'm doing him harm by protecting him from them".
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which had become a kind of campground for activists, waiting to talk about the matter, which led to the arrest of officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter contacted local food-packing business owners.
They prepared bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
A new kind of activism was gradually being formed for Ferrell.
She said that while a student at Missouri State University, she was president of the Student Minority Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health injustice in the black community, "My actions completely changed after August 9".
"I had no experience organizing.
It came on its own".
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, at an evening show.
Folayan said he and his own director of visual effects Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "want to document" what happened.
So Ferrell had this question, "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion was often expressed by a myriad of white people, who came to a community to help them with their pain and resistance...
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had no voice concentration, and we decided to do it differently".
Folayan had already established a relationship with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row inmates.
His involvement warmed Ferrell up to the project, which the other six area natives, as well as the "Who's the Street?" team watched for years after Brown was shot.
David said: "This is not a documentary about someone speaking for us or us, but about us".
"That's what was important to me, how these people were going to be represented because that's how I was going to be represented".
Folayan said, "While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, the movement was about "not a messiah leader, but a gathering of society", he proved the filmmakers were most open-minded, saying, 'I'm not going to be a messiah.'"
As a result, "Who's on the Streets?" surprisingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as his falling in love and marrying his wife.
Laughing at the first sight of the finished product, Ferrell said, "I felt like I was naked".
"But I realized that while doing this and humanizing black people, there could be some sensitivity".
And Ferrell's story reinforces and refocuses the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who launched the slogan #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of young black Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as gay.
"The black gay women in leadership generally kept the movement going", said Ferrell, "and that's because we were constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all the weight of this".
Folayan joined in, saying: "The movement is really supported by black women and many gay black women".
Yet Ferrell insists that "it's not something that's in the form of a positive action" and that it's not chosen because of his identity.
"He was the one who set the energy in motion", she says.
"But it's no coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, you're going to lose a lot of life living at these intersections.
You can feel the energy of it on the screen".
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are gone, but there are worrisome racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell's been under surveillance for another two and a half years for closing the highway during a show.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in what he calls my home as "majority".
Still, Ferguson keeps the song he carved into his memory three years ago when he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round, it's flat!
Irving told NBC Sports, "The world is not round".
The world is flat.
They're making people afraid to do that.
Oh, man, that's too much questioning.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the earth flat?
Or is it rotating round and round?
I think you should look into this.
I tell you, they're lying to our face.
They're lying to us!
Irving said, "I've believed for years that I wanted to believe".
I thought the world was round and rotating.
Do you really think we're in the solar system?
Nothing they sent back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is struggling with a career average of 24.4 points and 5.9 assists this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
A Fitting Similarity: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces of white, black and brown, hanging over the cables in the ceiling, each with almost unmistakable similarities.
These 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, with earplugs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years after leaking classified diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website, reportedly sent his hair cut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opens on August 2, is called A Fitting Similarity.
This is the product of two years of correspondence between a trans woman who was pardoned by Barack Obama three days before her term ended, and Manning, a leading opponent, who combined her discipline with her expertise in technology, computer science and art.
Using the DNA extracted from Manning to be algorithmically analyzed and create 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg not only revealed the traceability of the DNA data (that there are many ways to trace it and the determinism that comes from the essence of the interpretations), but also its identity with a strict, perhaps somewhat brain-driven interpretation.
Born Bradley but openly describing herself as a woman as a teenager, Manning was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six under the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
The image was suppressed by the prison, so that he had only one photograph: a black and white sand-shaped self-portrait of Manning, apparently nervous, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum yellow wig that was attached to him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was making a big comeback with his 2012 project Stranger Things.
In this, the artist painted portraits of what these people might look like by embellishing DNA from the effluents of cigarette butts and legal pieces like gum.
And just then, she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison and they asked for some kind of portrait to accompany this article", explained Dewey-Hagborg, at the press briefing of the new exhibition.
There was no visitation at the time, no photo shoot, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she was interested in doing a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected correspondents, exchanging many letters over a two-year period.
They even unveiled the book, The Bastarded Injuries, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, a cartoon book where the president forgives Chelsea's punishment and imagines a future where she can see the exhibition in person.
It was a sort of happy coincidence that Obama actually asked for Manning's release a few days after the book came out, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump is finding new, tweetable ways to fight government leakers and transgender soldiers and further foment the sharp divisions he is expected to repair, there is something profound and powerful about this exhibition that is currently opening.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason".
An artist's statement written on the gallery wall, which includes Manning's large-scale signature (the dot of the letter "i" in his surname is heart-shaped), called for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
There's a mitochondrial DNA sequence of it across the wall: many C's, G's and A's written in lead pencil...
By adding 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated science dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to show how amazingly similar we are all, at least biologically.
"What I hope people will learn from this is that they don't care about who we are in our genomes and how open to interpretation the genetic data is, how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, who exhibited his video work, Imitated Memories, in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and this is 30 of them".
The last piece in the exhibition, kept in a single room, is a page from the short story I mentioned earlier.
Here Manning is shown exiting the United States with a speaker made from the King Kong style Discipline Fortress.
"If they shut up your conversation, they win".
"So never shut up.
The Philadelphia artist said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me".
"I still get my hair twitching when I talk about it".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person (as he dreamed it was from his cartoon book) but when he sees it he will be greeted with masks that are his own genetic imitations, gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything in the exhibition, genetic haplogroups were written in lead pen to the height of Manning (5'2, Manning's height), which was specifically made.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "I used to put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd".
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, which was also the movement behind her liberation".
A Northwestern educator and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee who was found stabbed to death in a Chicago apartment.
Cook County records show that on Monday, arrests were made for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, who were charged with involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers picked up a phone call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments, and found multiple deep cuts to the victim's body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and that while police were actively searching for the two suspects, detectives were investigating the stabbing as a murder.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an email, Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university affairs, said Lathem was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville University said in an email: "We are in contact with the UK police and are ready to assist US investigating authorities in any way they need".
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, communications chief of the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are intensifying our efforts to find them", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager at Grand Plaza, who had just received a mysterious clue that something was happening in apartment number 1008.
The police described the scene as very horrifying.
Guglielmi also said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
Guglielmi said, "We believe the victim was having an affair with Latham, a faculty member".
The Grand Plaza administration issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are still working on the timeline and history of the victim and are investigating a number of incidents, including a possible family incident".
Italy seized the German ship
Italian police say the Iuventa ship, which is search and rescue for refugees in the Mediterranean, was seized yesterday on Lampedusa Island.
Police shared with journalists the records of phone conversations allegedly belonging to two members of the organization, and announced that the operation was carried out as part of an investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
It is suggested that Jugend Rettet members, who were also alleged to have been "actively engaged in illegal immigration on the Libya-Italy line", brought refugees to Italy at least three times, directly from the boats of Libyan human traffickers.
The allegations of the youth Rettet members being questioned by the prosecution include that they worked with some people from the Libyan Coast Guard.
The organization's statement said it was reviewing the allegations, saying it would continue to prioritize saving lives.
In addition to the ships of the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about 9 international civil society organizations are also involved in the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had prepared a 13-article code of conduct document for these organizations to comply with and required its signature.
Last minute: 5 buffets of Banli who attacked the magnificent were sealed
The five offices of Mahfuz Banli, a retired police officer who was detained by the court after the incident of the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yılmaz Büyükerşen, were sealed by the Tepebaşı Municipality.
According to Habertürk, the municipal teams were accompanied by a large number of police and the Cevik Forces.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map in the short term"
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the criteria of the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become operational again.
"A certain stage in the fulfilment of the roadmap criteria has been completed, RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map was updated in this context".
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulatory Accord Roadmap, which recently published on the agency's website, describing the criteria governing the re-opening of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry Russia about.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future".
However, one criterion on the list is that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the reported results of a government-sponsored investigation into alleged doping in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Mutko said: "While our anti-doping system admits a failure, we are also conducting an investigation.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept something that doesn't exist".
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
RUSADA's doping controls in Russia were suspended by WADA in the wake of the November 2005 doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), the June test was authorized to be planned and coordinated.
In July, following a visit to the agency's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to become a business again.
100 million people watched!
The video of "Come to Beşiktaş" announcing the transfer of Negredo quickly reached 100 million people in 18 countries.

Galatasaray President is not coming back empty handed
Former Galatasaray president Faruk Süren harshly criticized President Dursun Özbek who went to Bucharest and the capital Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the legendary president's special announcements to the morning readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek conversation: "We were finishing when we left".
The Galatasaray President will not go to waste, nor will he return empty-handed.
The president of Galatasaray doesn't go to the football player.
The football player comes at the President's feet.
Of course they meet, either kissing or hugging...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go to his feet.
You're paying 9 million euros to a player that Osmanlıspor bought for 300,000 euros...
Not 7.5 million, but 9 million with bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you're gonna play it and it's gonna be 7.5 to 9...
Uzbek's performance: I don't want to be a tease.
But the situation is clear.
G.Saray's values are eroding.
It's not just football, it's all the wrong approach.
The Court and the General Assembly are going to change that.
But I understand the members are pleased!
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of working at an e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, helpless, or worse, deceiving.
Even if he promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust him.
"There was never consistency or objectivity", says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco that specializes in hair care.
He called out for help.
A new kind of human resources startup is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These allow companies to conduct sophisticated, selective surveys, target specific teams and demographics, provide anonymous and complaint help lines to employees, and in some cases, allow employees to bypass senior managers and report a disorder directly to the board.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City startup that measures employee engagement by software analytics companies, said, "Now you have health tracking tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where's your Fitbit company?"
Errett says using Glint helps his employees understand what they think and feel three years later.
In addition to providing specific teams with sharp polls and selective polls, it offers a heat map that shows a glimpse of which departments in the company get the most complaints and which managers have low ratings, so that the reasons for these can be guessed.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to know about the culture of their workplace to avoid being the next Uber, which has been in a scandal since Uber described a harassment environment where those who openly state their thoughts are punished in a blog post published by a former employee.
For startups like Glint, this demand for oversight means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies detect and prevent misconduct, grew amid discussions earlier this year about Uber's demise.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to perform personalized "speed" checks, collect real-time secret responses, and extract heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous helpline where employees can report misconduct.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, the founder and president of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators".
Quinlan said: "If a company is abusive or unethical toward its employees, even if regulators do not act, it can face costly consequences because of consumer boycotts, employee negligence, or lawsuits.
With over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for over a year to help its employees become aware of the principles and procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email from the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hoped to be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vitrano, said these were mostly eye-wrenching and disturbing experiences, not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now with the company's use of Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers who lived in remote offices, cities or states (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices) can be identified and resolved more quickly.
"I can approach this employment experience with a holistic, 360-degree perspective", said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We also protect our shareholders from business lawsuits".
After the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in 2002 due to the Enron scandal's violation of ethical values, companies took ethics, values and employee relationships more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media took over", companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral.
"Before technology was used to control the dog, people used hope as a strategy".
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and charge a recurring fee to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that's approved by venture capital investors who support both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising given the interconnected nature, culture and venture capital of companies.
Increasing amounts of research show that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and are satisfied with what they're doing, they become more committed to making that company successful".
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when their employees are honest and feel they belong to the company.
If third-party analytics promises to increase employee honesty and self-esteem, it's not surprising that they find support.
Employee engagement data is important to work culture experts.
But the data is useless unless the company's people act.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come quickly enough or never, it can cause disappointment and make employees feel like they're broken.
Russell Raath, who is the chief consultant at Kotter International, a business management firm, and saw that companies made the mistake of relying too much on data collection, said, "If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready for 4,000 talks".
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
- Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights into its employees, and hopes that in the long run, this will turn into more employees being able to keep in an industry that is known for its high number of employees entering and leaving.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're losing people".
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies".
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions a day, which is a long day for the Bruins.
It's 11:00 p.m. and a bunch of UCLA football players hang out on the edge of a new training area on campus to chat.
Some reveal their upper-shaped, sweaty backs from the first day's toil in training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these minutes of free time are a midday break.
After three hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return home and take final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Centre for the 6:30 a.m. meeting the following morning.
"The next three days are a torture for these guys", said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before he returned to Tuesday.
The NCAA's cancellation of two practice sessions a day, designed to lift the burden on players, actually extended their days until at least the finals on Friday.
So the first three UCLA practice sessions are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already tight schedule.
The reward for not having two practice sessions a day is more than one training session a day; the Bruins are taking the start of camp a week ahead of the previous season, and during summer school, Mora is training at the summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to have 18 practice sessions by August 20 before they begin official match preparations for their opening game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports a rule change, even though the players have added new pens to their intensive training program.
Mora said, "We're putting a huge load on them for three or four days, and that's very challenging".
"And they've been through this recently; they're working, great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday, it'll be really great".
UCLA will stop training when camp is over, and it's not easy considering that the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is held in the rain by the adjacent parking lot and the adjacent football, which closes behind the fort with a protective net, stretches along the line of sight of its grounds.
The Bruins are scheduled to be staying at the hotel beginning this week, but Mora admits there may be a problem with these rooms being evacuated during the season.
Mora said, "We'll be safe".
"It's a real concern, and it's not too far off to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and videotape a workout.
If there's a video recording of a training session, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll be safe up there and we'll be safe up at 8 in the parking lot.
We're gonna do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
Facebook is increasing its story verification capabilities to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verifiers and showcase their findings under the original sharing, the world's largest online social networking site on Thursday said in an effort to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on the firm's website, it said it would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send them to story-checkers, and that it would potentially show the story-check results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main sources of news, known as fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has become a major political issue in Europe as French voters have been flooded with fake news ahead of the presidential election in May and support for a plan to impose sanctions if Germany fails to quickly remove hateful posts on social media before the elections there in September.
Facebook said in a separate statement in German on Thursday that a test of the new story verification feature was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook's product manager for news streaming, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions".
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "relevant article" feature and work on other changes to the news stream to reduce fake news.
Comic book creation: The story of a castle in England
In the recent past, the small Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music club and became a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with brown hair, passionate about historical documents, Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the valley of the River Bewl in Kent.
"I find it very beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says thoughtfully.
"How personal to hold this letter".
A Castle in England, spanning from the Edwardian period to the Middle Ages, each story documents families who lived in Scotland to be painted by a different artist named from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Tooth of the Dead and Other Stories, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories from the British Library.
"I even found a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700's by a double agent working for King James' supporters", he says.
"That was his thumbprint!
Letters always smell like fire because you used to light a fire for light.
For someone 300 years in the future, that smell makes him feel like he's there.
Oh, I love the archives!"
Being a lover of old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and staying in a castle for almost four months ("I've been overstepping my warm welcome, to be honest with you") seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, scanning archives, and studying many treasures and antiques, including the centuries-old bottles of backbone heads and trenches mounted on the mansion's walls.
He spoke to guards, gardeners, and artists who sometimes worked on illustrations of his book, and he toured the grounds and remains of the old castle.
Then at night, he would "drink whiskey and start writing".
The National Trust's exact date of birth is relatively unknown, as it was only reached when the last heiress Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to take over the archives, which he describes as follows: "For centuries aristocrats have said, 'Oh, throw it into the ceiling.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps of who and what possessed the boundaries: "You think land disputes would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a bushy tree over which two families fought.
Fuck you guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Uprising of 1381, use the castle as a leap point to make a wider introduction to English history.
"This book, The Knights of Kent and Sussex, records a rebellion in the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising had started around here, and I thought a rebellion might be a good starting point.
Maybe there's a connection between the two?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, a 18th-century smuggler, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and decorated his own funeral.
The Darrells are Rhodes' most beloved Scotney family: "These gentlemen looked like pretty scams, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
"In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy older women, "who I imagine are a group of handsome men skilled at making female heirs".
Rhodes, who's done his job at the fort, is looking for another solo writing experience.
In the Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week work on a comic about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been recaptured by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
"I'm sorry I broke up", she says.
"I'm like, 'Oh, I have to go and face the fucking real life now.'"
'Maho' reaction to Meral Akshener
The Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, İsmet Büyükataman, made a written statement on social media and in the press about the resignation claims made recently regarding MHP.
The grandmaster, using the expression "who flowed" to the MHP from social media and "some old rifle corners of Marxists", claimed that "play and speculation were being used to prevent the nationalist movement from continuing to exist under the roof of the MHP after September 12".
Grandfather said,
"Those who cannot digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who cannot attract the Turkish homeland, have a broken record, a bloated criminal record, a foggy ideology, a confused mind, and they are shaking their hands".
"Now they have resigned 410 members of the management and members of the MHP Kocaeli Gölcük County Organization and 215 in the district of Yenişehir in Bursa".
The public is misled by false and untrue news like 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
The newspaper columns are full of lies, the deception is deep.
As with the number of resignations, the number of staff in the places mentioned does not exceed the thumbs of a hand.
Grandmaster, who described the resignations as "word" said that the public was being misdirected and manipulated by the polls.
The grandmaster said, "Their propaganda and campaigns to create awareness against the MHP will be reversed".
Speaking about the resignations, MHP Secretary General Büyükataman said:
The sword-wielding former Marxists cannot destroy the place the MHP has taken in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
There's a dirty account behind all the comments, the perception management methods.
Because politics and the media have been looking at the MHP's base.
It makes no sense to us that those who are among us and do not work for our party and do not strive for it, resign now.
What's the matter with those who can't use our party for their own good?
The group that has not touched the MHP, shared our memories, understood our countries, joined our struggle, even if they do, must find other activities.
The efforts of those who cannot attract the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party to foment a coup d'état, debate and disorder are a desperate endeavor.
And the bird will turn and strike its owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish nation that has stood firm despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, Grandikataman said that "the nationalist movement is not without property" for those who claim to be targeting the MHP.
"The outer crops that feed off the ocean will not reach their destination, no matter the cost", he said.
Using the expression "the traitors of the people will go crazy and become ashes in a hypocritical fire", MHP's Büyükataman, in his statement, ranking opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, claimed: "From the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Perinçekgill, from the PKK to the FETÖ, whoever does what they do, they will not be able to operate on the right to own the fate of the Turkish nation".
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned Turkey without MHP, the government without MHP, the honorable men who wanted the parliament without MHP.
Now we're gonna ruin the games, we're gonna ruin the players.
Grandmaster, who said "the patents of patriotism are in MHP", used the following words in reference to Meral Akshener: "Like in the old Greenblack production of Banker Bilo, it is obvious that after days of driving the villagers of Maho to Germany, they leave them on a mountain slope of Istanbul, leaving them on the edge of a cliff, saying, 'I'm taking you to power,' the resignants of the thing they're after.
That's their business, but we only want these people to be new to where they're going.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla
Kjaer signed a contract with the yellow-lacivert team for a transfer to Sevilla for €12.5 million, which went down in history as the most expensive defensive transfer for the Spanish team.
The Danish star will be wearing the number 4 shirt in Seville.
It's easier for families with babies than THY.
According to the THY Press Advisory, the national airline, which puts the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit", which was developed to study the needs of infants and their families between the ages of 0-2 years, began to be offered to baby travelers travelling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit, made with a specially designed bag, includes a lower changeable lid, a single-use breast pad, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a newborn wet cotton diaper, and a breast pad.
Products that do not contain parabens, alcohol, paints or harmful chemicals were produced taking into account the sensitivity of the baby's skin.
Washington is changing the Green Card rules.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said there will be a new immigration plan in the United States that changes the Green Card rules.
It would reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighten rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and endorsed by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will be for English-speaking candidates, those with the financial resources and skills to benefit our economy", Trump said, according to American media reports.
The authors have interpreted the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
I've been missing two seasons, and I've never seen the excitement and glory of Kadıköy...
A team of "maniac hearts" that Aykut Kocaman has put out in absentia was on the field to make a "stand behind" deal with his supporters.
We can bring criticism to your game, to your positions, to your performances, but I haven't watched a game that works and seeks like that in a long time.
He showed it in the first game, but yesterday he put his appendices on his shoulder, the field commander of Fenerbahçe is now Valbuena.
The age of the transfer was a problem, but Kocaman's words had the phrase "unabashed character".
Thirty years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ant to Risa Chalombay.
If he does, he'll be the most appropriate comment for the French player.
He's been all over the field, he's been in all the passing organizations, he's always been responsible, and he's been making a huge show of his own, and he's been scoring.
Alper's lead, second forwards, left the Sturm Graz squad "limited" on the field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe was constantly looking for a formula to break through such a hard wall while winning the circuit without a corner.
They dominate the ball, but they're not producing any effective passes in the opponent's penalty area.
This image may give the impression that "I need a centrefuge", but we're facing a game where the only centrefuge in hand is unable to position himself.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or they needed to improve their performance a little bit.
After the score was 1-1 they missed two straight chances.
It was important that they made the tour, but it would make the night even better to get this fan up and say "goal" to the players who applauded the players' struggle.
Probably have another transfer or two by Monday.
But the truth is, Fenerbahce needs number 12 most...
We're on the brink of a bright and exciting season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those in the front row.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is setting up the zipper, he needs a little more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will improve.
You can see clearly that all the football players on the field have increased confidence.
They need a lot of last night's applause for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just as you're thinking 2017 can't be any more weird, a new report is coming out on the technological developments in the sex robot industry.
- I know.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Institute for Responsible Robot Science (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
Noel Sharkey, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and founder of FRR, says we need to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of nails.
Mr Sharkey said of the new report's release: "People are laughing at them but the companies are actually shipping a lot and we're going to see more of them".
Modern sex babies evolved into robots with silicone skin that is hot to the touch, especially human-like reactions, performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to match their own blood by choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, to the type or color of its nails.
But with so many robots having "human" that they can make a Stepford Woman seem innovative, it's getting even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into silicone leather robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize their robots according to character traits they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Fried Farrah" with a shy, "adventure-ridden" personality, and "Wild Wendy".
True Companion's website is excited: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible".
So what you like, he likes, what you don't like, he doesn't like, and so on.
And they're just like real people in the daytime.
He can be sleepy, willing to talk, or "in full mode".
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human relationships, but the overly obedient female personality traits, the most thought-provoking of which are the violent calls he made as he approached Frijit Farah.
On their website, True Companion compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but to a male vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator (it's exactly what it sounds like) why can't men have a Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat towards sex drive through submission, an optional addition to the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and while FRR has drawn attention to their growing popularity, they are currently in the outer reaches of consumer culture.
But those who leak from the ends can be highly informative about the course of our times.
And many people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It's no coincidence that a president in the White House has boasted of sexually assaulting women, and these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide.
The most frightening thing about The Handmaid's Tale is the graphics that show all the details, not the scientific bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image makes you feel.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (in proportion to porn star numbers, of course).
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch them and to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personality", robots clearly don't represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There is nothing about their activities or their past, nothing that will reveal their independence or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they're pleasure slaves.
Or, as 2017 put it, the maidens.
Attack on an American military convoy:
A suicide attack in the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
It was reported that one NATO soldier and three civilians were injured in the blast, five of the wounded were American soldiers on convoy and one was a translator working with NATO forces.
The official statement by NATO support forces in Afghanistan said that NATO forces inflicted a homemade explosive by a suicide bomber during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
It was reported that the wounded personnel were being treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
There's no life-threatening injury.
Local media reports say the suicide bomber is a Taliban.
The great skill of Trump?
To make Mitt Romney look like a symbol of common sense
The political divide that polarized the U.S. electorate, the micro-scale family split, became the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We all strive to blow up our own filter bubbles, I promise.
Less talked about is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm mentioning this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and is a disgruntled Republican in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that a united front against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Everyone Trump knew, including his Republican brother, who has been debating politics for decades, suddenly and oddly, is on the same side.
It's a good thing for dinner tables, of course, but it seems to me that in a broad context, it carries significant risks.
The left was revived by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency gave us all the power to push right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior will no longer shock us.
There's even a more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump is "normalizing" right-wing Republicans who are against his standards, and they suddenly seem like a symbol of logic.
I find myself nostalgic for the weird version of Mitt Romney's insanity these days: the dog in the attic, the 14 percent income tax rate (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), which are both really very minor crimes for Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate needs to be sane to see if he's made immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the horse racing club in Central Park, the largest of the New York State Parks Department's horse racing clubs, and the top three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses were gigantic, center-cylinder fiberglass designs (all clowns with strange faces and animals turned to look in fear behind their shoulders) and the jamming music freaked out.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the views of high-rise buildings become boring, the skyline becomes too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city is not reaching its lowest.
Thirty-five years later, I still can't quite get over the day I discovered that the Swiss Cottage was not actually a Swiss country house, but a vast crossroads in north London.
But riding in Central Park is still a weirdly magical experience, so two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go here and have a great time.
If I could have given him a full score, I would have given him a full score, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my transaction "experiment" between 1 and 5 stars before I transferred my credit card to a bond exchange this week.
Same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note with a 15% discount for what you bought at the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral shopping, but also puts pressure on the server to personalize an event that doesn't need to be.
The poor woman at the bonmarche stood up and smiled like she was sorry, and I, in the midst of boredom, gave her five stars for my credit card experience.
They were wearing their sweaters when the temperature was over 41 degrees .
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season is experienced, people flocked to Munzur beaches.
Since noon, young, young, old, women and men who entered the beaches along the Munzur River, while the temperatures were well suppressed, tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling themselves in icy waters.
The beaches along the Munzur River have become crowded, especially as Tunisian citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England spend their holidays in their homelands instead of the Aegean or Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who was among those who chill at Munzur Beach, said that he preferred Tunceli to the western provinces for the holidays.
"There is no ice like Munzur water anywhere in the world, and Munzur cools us in these temperatures".
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said he preferred Munzur River in Tunceli to the Fountain or Bodrum beaches and did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he said occurred after falling into the cell of prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors objected to the earlier manslaughter decision.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Steenkamp dead by shooting him multiple times at his home in Pretoria, facing the door of a toilet cabin.
Pistorius claimed to have confused his girlfriend with someone who had entered the cabin uninvited at night.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they consider too light this time.
The National Reconciliation Centre said it would appeal to the High Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius will face up to 15 years in prison if prosecutors succeed.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
First convoy is dismissed
The pilgrim candidates who are to travel to Saudi Arabia under the organization of the Diyanet Affairs Presidency were greeted with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
The ceremony, held at the External Lines Terminal before the first pilgrimage convoy, was attended by about 200 pilgrim candidates and their relatives.
Turkish Airlines (THY) distributed roses to pilgrims who were travelling to the holy land on a scheduled flight.
The Hajj convoy in Ankara has left Esanboğa.
The Kafile also included martyrs and their relatives who benefited from the "Rushless Hajj for Gazites and their Martyrs" program, which was first implemented this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Camping Illegal
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of camping illegally.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
They were released the same day as the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened their controls on free camping and still severely punish those caught resting in unallocated areas.
It'll be checked out all season.
The ministry said the court could cut the sentence.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22), with two friends, traveled to Turkey in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who was driving the car they rented to Adana and Mersin, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
His friends came with him, and when they couldn't reach Hoffman despite all the calls, they informed his family in Holland.
While police were also moving to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
The announcements are BASTIRIP
Robin Hoffman, who is in police custody here, printed out missing persons notices to be distributed to Adana and Mersin for his brother's search.
He said that they last heard from his brother Robin Hoffman on July 8, "We first contacted the police in the Netherlands".
Later, I and two of my friends came to Turkey and applied to the police.
We haven't received any news yet, and we haven't found any leads.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until we get a news".
Congratulations on seeing Ayşe Ceren, second world.
At the 2017 World Palette Swimming Youth Championship in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş became world second over 400 meters of water.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş, who won the silver medal.
On the first day of the 2017 World Palette Swimming Youth Championship in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş became world second over 400 metres of water.
Ceren took second place with a spectacular performance on the track, where she competed with eight finalists, but she only missed the gold medal by 27 seconds.
Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal in the 400 metres with a time of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight male and eight female athletes in the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, goodbye, Mom".
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which is said to be 30 so far, he called his mother at the time of the fire and said, "I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair".
It was revealed that she was accompanied by an Italian woman, Gloria Trevisan, who said, "Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye".
Among the dozens of people who were not reported after the fire, were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and her Italian boyfriend Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that British officials had confirmed that both young men had lost their lives.
The lawyer, who said the young people's families were suffering greatly, also asked the journalists not to insist on an explanation.
I think I'm dying, goodbye, mother
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out and that she cried herself when she heard these last few conversations recorded by her mother.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times for two hours after the fire started around 1:00 a.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was more calm in his first speech, said, "Mom, bad things are happening here, there's a fire".
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's a bit of smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to open the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working", he said.
In subsequent calls, Gloria Trevisan, who was increasingly concerned about the increase in fire, was reported to have said:
Mom, my whole life is passing by.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me, and it's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the Italian government's fault.
Both Gloria Trevisan, who is an architect, and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who had struggled to find work after graduating last year, moved to London from the Veneto region in the north of the country in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only found a job in her native country for 300 euros, soon found work in London for a salary of 1,800 pounds (about 2,060 euros).
"Gloria went to London to help her family", said lawyer Sandri, who said Gloria Trevisan's family was having a hard time financially.
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately", he said.
The drama of Italy failing to provide jobs for its youth
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger, saying, "This is a government mistake that forced our youth to flee abroad to find work".
In Italy, the unemployment rate is 12 percent, while the youth rate is well above 40 percent.
As this problem grew, many young Italians, especially in England, began to emigrate to many European countries in the last few years.
Last year alone, the number of youths forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Commentaries in the Italian press on the confirmation of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi also said that this was a drama of a country that could not provide jobs for its youth.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in protein and milk products may help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This untreatable health condition, affecting 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid in protein tryptophan helps develop immune cells that develop a sturdy gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that immune cells patrol the intestines to prevent microbes stored in food from sneaking into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced with cells that encourage endurance by protecting sensitive tissues from damage.
If the balance shifts too much toward inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of immune cell that promotes resistance was produced in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the formation of cells.
"We have linked the bacterial species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the gut microbiome, to the development of a cell population that promotes endurance", said Professor Colonna.
Mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
If the same thing happens in humans, L. suggested that a diet rich in reuterium and tryptophan could develop a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, while working on a type of immune cell that improves endurance, discovered that a group of experimental mice had such cells but that another group of mice of the same species kept in a different location did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of mice, in other words, the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA sequencing of the intestines of mice was done and it was found that mice with immune cells had six types of bacteria but that mice without them lacked this.
Because they were treated in a sterile environment, mice that lacked an gut microbiome and didn't develop such an immune cell were given L. reutery, and immune cells were developed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred less of this nonbacterial fluid to immature immune cells from mice.
The immune cells became cells that promote endurance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it was found to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and that most of us have L. reutery in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri developed in humans as in mice, but disorders in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage because these cells control the inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in cases where L. reuteri is present cause this population to spread".
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'contract' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "gift" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40m transfer from Chelsea began with United's 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in their final pre-season match, and was filled with the position that Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira enjoyed as they struggled to make the forward.
However, Matic, who was left out of the Maviler's pre-season Asian tour, had a serious degree of match condition and was only able to score 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this needed to be improved before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his thinking genius... he thinks football".
"We'll help him get ready early".
As Mourinho began to form his first XI for the start of the season, like Matic, his new transfer mates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also appeared at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers but the club insisted that he had already done "a remarkable job" by completing three of his four priority transfers.
"Thank you to the club for taking three of the four".
"I'd be happier if they got four out of four, but they put a lot of effort into it".
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to the Swedish Social Welfare Agency, the number of sexual dissatisfactions reported in 2005 to 1 in 100,000 people rose to 8 in 100,000 in 2015.
Last year, 197 children and adolescents were admitted to Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, most of whom were dissatisfied with their gender.
Child psychiatrist Lousise Frisen, who works at the same hospital, noted that the increase may be due to the emergence of a more open society, saying that "openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society".
Sexual dissatisfaction disorder is not known to have any relation to sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
The teams of the Office of Smuggling and Combating Organized Crimes of the Udamish County Directorate of Security organized an operation at the home of 36-year-old F.T. in Ulker Street, 3 September neighborhood.
A home search found a delicate balance of 33 extacy pills.
F.T. who tried to jump out of the balcony was arrested.
It was recorded that F.T. will be transferred to the court after his security clearance.
Transfer to the newly formed Malatyaspor
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams in the Super League, has linked the winger Turgut Doğan Shahin who wore the November uniform last season to the colours.
According to the statement from the yellow-black club, the 29-year-old wingman has signed a two-year contract as part of the transfer work.
The statement said, "A two-year agreement was reached with the uniformed wingman Turgut Doğan Shahin in Kasımpaşa.
May all be well with our new Malatyaspor".
A British inventor uses a hand gesture to get into his house and car with a microchip
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open his front door, access his office, and even run his car with just one hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, has transferred the tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger, and the service is now offered by his company BioTeq to people who want to make their lives easier with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be applied to medical standards, Winchester went into partnership with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to a microchip transferred to cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also make changes to the locks on homes and vehicles at £300 per lock to make them compatible with the chip.
This technology is attached to the home of a married man with a child and the BMW Z4 and the car is running with his hands behind the wheel.
The White House Show Costed Taxpayers Thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the decision to fly a Marine helicopter into the grasslands of the South for an organization promoting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president took office, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention at the organization's July 17 presentation of American construction programs at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have toured the products produced in all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklifts from Mississippi.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Department requested the helicopter's presence by a separate order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn for the "unmanned" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an email to the Deputy Marine Aviation Commander, the day before the organization, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization".
The message said the helicopter would arrive at the south lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. organization and would stay there until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The note added that if the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty time constraints.
While the unit's security personnel were on the ground, the air carrier was still in the air, while the original flight crew was on the helicopter during the organization.
The records provided to TIME do not indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately necessary.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this condition.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked was whether he violated Hatch's Law and we were told he did not".
"Looks like you're crowded", replied the Deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political implications.
At the organization, the president referred to the health care reform efforts that were ongoing in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to regulate government regulation.
The use of air vehicles known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents should use these to travel.
But it's not unusual to formally ask that these be used only for a photo opportunity.
Trump was noticed in February when his presidential plane went behind the scenes of the first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and when he noticed that his Twitter account was filled with messages about the president's use of the plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, which is made of American materials by American workers from all 50 states", said Lindsay Walters, White House press secretary.
The HMX-1 crew frequently makes training flights in the Washington area, practicing on the south lawn to drop the President of the United States at the White House with a point shooting.
Trump performed 58 drills at the White House in early July while in Germany for the G-20 summit.
An official said the flight for the Made in America organization was considered a training requirement for the aircrew that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "unrelated presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers don't charge for any other numbers in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said his companies were not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the south lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost to the organization.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 fiscal year hourly rates, the Department of Defense's rate of receipt of VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the air vehicle's flight time as 30 minutes to both directions from Marine Corps Air Facility headquarters in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims the actual operating cost of the helicopter is well below that.
"It's very misleading for taxpayers to make a charge based on estimates of the taxpayer's tax rate", Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and annual subsidence costs".
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's cost-benefit rates do not include personnel costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer had advocated for the use of helicopters for this organization.
Spicer said, "It's unthinkable here to showcase what's done in America this week".
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think that thousands, if not hundreds, of people's work depends on it.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work tirelessly to make.
So it is certainly appropriate to bring it up".
It's unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while he was walking around the south lawn for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump called Sikorsky's representatives, joking about the company's products in his fleet and the media.
"I know Sikorsky very well", he said, "I have three of them".

Narcon Season 3: Cali Cartel comes to the fore with Pablo Escobar's departure from the hit Netflix series
Even though Pablo Escobar's killer has appeared in season two, it doesn't look like the Netflix series will end.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the online streaming service, with the first offering insights into the bad characters of the coming period as they receive their first trailer.
With the third season, the DEA is turning its attention to the richest drug smuggler in the world: Cali Cartel.
They are run by four powerful mob fathers and run "like a Fortune 500 company", but with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, the brains of Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis), Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of Mexico's connections, and Chepe Santacruz is speaking in London (Pepe Rapazote) in New York.
In the newly released fragment, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who has supported American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos is set to premiere on September 1.
According to B.M., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, played a role.
Nicholas Haysom, vice president of the B.M. Relief Mission, says hundreds of women are running for provincial council, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated", she said in her statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representative and credible if only women are fully involved and included in all parts of the election process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have threatened to block the election process, which is at a time when international military operations have become a consultative task.
This year's election marks the first peaceful transition of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women will contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan reports that 1.2 million women registered for the election out of 3.6 million registered voters.

GMB's concern about McVitie's investment in the Glasgow plant
A union is asking the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's for assurances of a long-term commitment to its production at its Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland said the company has remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross area.
The factory, which produces the Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested more than £5 million in the area in the last few years.
He added that if there were any changes to their operations, employees and union representatives would be "first notified".
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "address concerns that no funding is being provided for the modernization of production tapes".
Drew Duffy, senior GMB organizer, said: "Our members are deeply concerned about the lack of clarity from the general manager of the thesis on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tollcross.
For generations families have worked here and the workforce is concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical base for adequate employment in an area with high unemployment and social poverty.
From a business, wage and prosperity perspective, in the face of Brexit conditions, rising living costs and chronic production declines, a four-headed manufacturing presence at McVitie's, east end of Glasgow, is urgently needed".
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The plant manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate our commitment to workers and union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives where a few issues were openly discussed.
So we told our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we were constantly reviewing our operations to stay competitive, which is true for all our businesses and facilities.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross facility, particularly in production tapes and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross's legacy as a manufacturing facility, and if there is any change in our operations at the facility, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Necip and Utku stayed in Beşiktaş for another 4 years
Beşiktaş Club has extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) containing data on footballers, Beşiktaş extended his contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the black and white team's infrastructure and signed his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, began to wear uniforms for the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who rose to captaincy, played a total of 254 official matches in the Beşiktaş format.
TFF website also revealed that the goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, who was hired by Beşiktaş last season, has signed a contract with him until May 31, 2021.
The website states that Utku was removed from the temporary transfer status on 1 August 2017 and renewed its license on 2 August.
Utku Yuvakuran has been in the 21-year-old Six-League in Beşiktaş, where he played last season.
The young goalkeeper was only in 2 Turkish Cup matches in black and white.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar after offering a £189m free transfer, but did they warn Barcelona against the world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 side set to break the world transfer record by more than double the amount Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89 million, the sensational offer has moved the summer transfer window forward.
With PSG offering a weekly salary of £500,000 after taxes, it shows that when the transfer is completed Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest earning professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalans' management has insisted that since Santos' arrival in 2013 the club has always done its best to look after him, Barcelona is known to be angry at the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
So, was the football world warned about this scene three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed his interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a harsh warning to all clubs seeking to sign one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will turn against them, we will contact their players".
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll suffer the consequences".
Spanish club Barcelona, earlier this summer, seems to have crossed that line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has confirmed that they will not allow the Italian national team to leave under any conditions and Barcelona feels the reflections of this interest as well, losing Neymar to their greatest values.
The sentence for preventing the reading of the Sala was overturned
The alleged defendants, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz, were charged with "willingly and knowingly helping", "resisting to not perform the task" and "insulting" Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Court.
The court commission, which decided to fine Gulşen for "insulting a public official for his duties" and giving up the victim's complaint, and considering the manner of processing the crime, sentenced him to a fine of 7 thousand liras, while the accused Yılmaz was sentenced to one year in prison for "resisting not to perform the task" and given the importance of the task preventing the victim from doing the crime, the date and time of the crime in view of the public and the future of Turkey.
The committee has decided to convert the prison sentence for Yılmaz into a fine of 6,000 liras.
After the two defendants were fined, the defendants' lawyers appealed.
The case is being reviewed at the Istanbul District Court 23.
He's in the pen.
The court, which completed its investigations, found the sentence against the accused Kenan Gülşen appropriate, deciding that the sentence for "insult" was applied in the legal context, that the action was correctly classified and that it corresponded to the type of crime provided for in the law.
When the High Criminal Court met Imam Mustafa Baki who read the slaying of Nait Yılmaz and left the mosque, he said, "You are not pouring torment or punishment on the street".
The president's been taken.
He said that the act of walking on it, trying to shoot, and admitting that the victim had been unable to read the Quran and had not been able to read the Quran at certain intervals, led to the crime of "resisting to not do the task".
The district said that despite the reasons given by the local court, the action took place while the victim finished the task of sealing and torturing and informed the public in front of the mosque, but in the concrete case, there was no task that the victim began or continued, the fact that the public duty performed by this act created a crime of attempting to injure the victim, and the defendant was sentenced without sufficient reason to allow an inspection to be made to allow the accused to accept that the victim tried to prevent his subsequent tasks.
The district stated that the fact that the defendant had no evidence, that the victim did not suffer material harm due to the crimes committed against him, and that the spiritual damage did not prevent the execution of the sentence from being delayed and that it was not discussed whether it would be applied if the victim had given up his complaint.
The court, which considered the appeal claims of the defendant Nait Yılmaz's lawyer on these grounds, decided that the judgment against the accused was violated and the case was returned to the court of first instance.
Six Europeans on Interpol's live bomb list
The German newspaper Die Welt reported that in May, Interpol (International Police Organization) sent a list of 173 people who could have carried out suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization Daesh to security agencies in European countries.
The list of 132 people reportedly came from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of the people on the list were identified as European citizens.
These people are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The suspect, who is reported to be a 27-year-old German national from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia, has been linked to ISIS from Germany.
The person was reported to have visited Egypt in the autumn of 2012, Turkey, and Syria in the last year.
In a statement on social media accounts in mid-July, the group said that the man had died in Rakka.
The German Security Agency has been informed that the newspaper has not answered its questions on the subject.
Names on Interpol's list were allegedly seized in operations against ISIS in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, the American intelligence services have reviewed this list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol reportedly forwarded the list to European police agencies in May.
The German security agency Die Welt reported that ISIS may be trying to send some of the names on the list to Europe to carry out suicide attacks.
Soldier's farewell with a pump-action rifle: 5-year-old Starlucks could lose his eye
In Job, the young men's soldiers were bleeding.
A crowd gathered in the park in the Karadolap neighborhood to say goodbye to their friends who were going to the army the night before.
According to the report, M.K. and O.A. in the group fired in the air from time to time with pump-action rifles.
After the soldiers left, the group began to disband.
M.K. was passing the playground full of children when he fired a handgun at the ground.
The first kid sitting on a park bench because of the slow crap, five people were injured.
Those moments were also reflected on the park security cameras.
Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balkır, Yıldızsu Unus, İnci Kaya were taken to the surrounding hospitals by ambulance.
Among the injured, five-year-old Star Unus was reported to be at risk of losing his left eye.
Stellasu's grandmother Mary Rock told DHA about those moments.
"The military celebration started at 8 p.m"., said Kaya, who said the incident happened while he was in his grandson's arms.
It took two hours.
The military party is over.
The young people are starting to disperse.
It was gonna be the same as us getting up.
That's when the gun went off, right in front of me.
My granddaughter's not well.
He's 80 to 90 percent likely to lose his eyesight.
We talked to the doctor, he said.
They took one of the nonsense out of your eye and the other in your eye.
"He's had one surgery, maybe he'll have 10", she said.
The suspect M.K. and O.A. were arrested by the Asayish Bureau of the Ayub County Security Directorate.
Two people were arrested after being questioned by police.
