The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Beards and barbs Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis, called a rahis, but do exhibit other characteristic elements of feathers, researchers concluded that the rahis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impression. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken poop.

below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the many smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche; each cat has its own role to play, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called herds.
The families are made up of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behaviour to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.

The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they'll catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and almost all the animals the ocelots hunt are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground to find them.
Ocelotes hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island, from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members start to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say that they're the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Species are an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e. expel) from the lungs.

For example, the most common static format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size from the late analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the digital camera's image sensor formats.
The confusing 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to it.

On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.

The war costs of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expense and interest associated with bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events unfolded is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is governed by an associated logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has effectson society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you might say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy operator in the Union.


In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.


This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.

Through the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to lock their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds, originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socializing is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some wild children have been abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child has been due to the child's rejection by the parents due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that has cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or site method is not a learning method, but rather a support tool for people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scale, but so is the little stickman in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is included in the software, providing the role of interrogating, providing clues and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on his own.
children are placed in family care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, to even extortion.
Shouldn't have kids growing up in an environment where they're deprived of food, love and education, but they are.
We see the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system needs to provide safe housing, caring caregivers, sound education and reliable health care.
The home care is supposed to cover the needs of the children, which were not covered in the home they had previously been in.
Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The other distinctive features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of approaching types of use and satisfaction.
Learning and socializing are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement andcontinuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to observe whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, has shown how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutations add new genetic variations and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds at each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans has a hard time meeting its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Plus, failure to do so brings serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to access were leaf and legume proteins, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if they're not cooked.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the principle of proportionality to the common agricultural policy.

Sleep interruption is the procedure whereby you intentionally wake up during the normal sleep period only to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you into a state of consciousness without waking up completely.

Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can reach enlightenment. the only thing standing in the way of that goal is their own tension and negativity.

It was going to take 40 years and be fought in earnest by the armies of the delegates on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.

The plans were rendered useless almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were put into action creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one part of the oceans to another.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
lf the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably succeeded in taking over Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.

Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them near the house to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing places, usually in the care of goats that were often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonway roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Though these wagonways consisted only of wooden boards laid out in parallel, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
The crosses were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster use of wooden wheels for wagons.
In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The earliest known means of transport was walking; people began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning straight man).
The Autralopithecus, their predecessor, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedal seven million years ago.

After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten note, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
Environ 150 à 200 copies ont été faites dans la nuit, connues sous le nom de "postres Dunlap".
On July 8, the document was given its first public reading by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
one was sent to George Washington on July 6 who read it to his troops in New York on July 9 a copy arrived in London on August 10
The 25 Dunlap posters that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original manuscript no longer exists.

Pretty much all the computers we use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and the designation of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Bud is the term used by particular entomologists for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to ticks, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bedbugs are native, adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is neither in their best interests nor in the child's.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.

Naturalists and philosophers made extensive use of the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotelis's ideas were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially upon the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments either tagging the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline type cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.

examples of fieldwork include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.

Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.

Why do transport systems generate such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to stay within reasonable constants; consequently, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mating partners much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.

The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, having a width of six miles at points.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km long, and it accumulates water from thousands of smaller bodies of water.

Aristotelis, the philosopher, proposed that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: water, earth, air and fire.
He was referring to the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.

The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill.Scratching the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the near side and 100 km in the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in higher elevations.
It might be more maria nearby, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.

Two popular theories about content are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.

Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
(Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organisation? One goal of putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can freely manifest.
The process whereby an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to bring organisations to higher performance.
The data from neurobiology is the physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, and as such, allows for narrowing the research area and defining it more precisely.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulations, which helps us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
e AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computing, dealing with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.

AI is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but has also been used in a few software applications for personal computers and video games.
Outings are an important part of any classroom. Often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus tour is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in class.
The virtual sharing of a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with the upcoming classes.
n example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, and the previous versions are maintained online, to serve as an album.

Bloggingalso forces students to be more aware of the world around them.The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their study far beyond the ordinary school day.
The proper use of blogscan help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
