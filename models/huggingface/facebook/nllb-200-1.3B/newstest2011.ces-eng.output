The SSR in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the bakery.
The new councillors of the capital from the Czech Republic will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the Chamber of Deputies.
The members of the new council from the ČSSD "tried out", as they know, the notoriously established slang that was created in the city hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
A coded dictionary, introduced by Prague's political whiz during the previous era of mayor Pavel Béma, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and events in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councilmen didn't understand the terms.
At least that's what she says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I'm rather a newcomer to Prague politics", said the councillor for culture Lukáš Kaucký, when asked about the "Komotrovsky" dictionary.
And although he is a political veteran, the same reaction was expressed by councilman Karel Březina.
Like the term "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you've ever given me that I use occasionally".
"I don't recognize slang in general".
From the dictionary, whose terms were published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the candy store", "bull's neck", "betray the capital" and "flatter".
Three councillors agreed to the quiz, and the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to be the future head of Prague's education - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth councilman Petr Dolínek has rejected the test.
"I don't do these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how civic democrats are having fun".
"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to get along on our programs", he said.
As already mentioned, councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that it was about the influential businessman and friend of the ex-expressman Béma Roman Janouškov.
"Voldemort" means nothing to Kauck, and the only term he got right on the test was "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanc Tunnel", says Kautsky, and immediately adds: "But I know it more from the newspapers".
"I'm gonna have to pay for some language course", he jokes.
The golf hole is then used as a tunnel by the Blanka administration, not only by the matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Lucas Plachem knows where to find the character - he knows the meaning of the phrase "go to the candy store".
"I mean go to some Prague business", is Shy's close to deciphering that it's the headquarters of Janusz's companies.
According to Bresina, he recalls that he got his knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test takers, there is no such familiar vocabulary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with my colleagues, but it seems we really don't have anything like that".
"We call each other by name, sometimes using abbreviations and compound names", says Prague's Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party chairman Petr Hulínský, nicknamed Hulda by the party.
"At school they called me Březa, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", admits Karel Březina.
The name's been tried and it works.
Councillor Weinert is for the party of Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, MP Miroslav Poche, who before the elections pointed out fraud in the sponsorship of the party, has some colleagues nickname "Gamer".
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in party discourse.
Hulínsky is said to be uncomfortable with Huldu, but Aktuálně.cz has recorded another nickname for the Prague chairman.
"Doctor of the Law of the Oshkosh" supposedly reminds us that Petr Hulínský obtained his degree as a JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", has issued a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several things in common.
They are more likely to be older, unable to work, for example due to health reasons, single and childless.
The one who "becomes" a witch is sent to isolation so she doesn't endanger the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is very rare".
"Even young healthy women are not excluded because they help with work and childbirth", explains a religious sister who cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their community in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She's issued a brochure that should help reduce the witch hunt.
It's got a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", pointed out the disadvantage of literacy, the newspaper Die Standard.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week after being tortured, oil-poured and set on fire by three women and two men.
The case was reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was anointed with oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
He was said to have been set on fire by a group of people who were trying to "cast out the evil spirit" from a woman.
The isolation of "witches" is encouraged by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Soul-eaters have always been a danger".
While the government is trying to calm the witch hunt in Burkina Faso, the president himself attended the Gambia witch hunt last year.
"After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammeh launched a massive manhunt for witches who were allegedly involved in her death and attempted to use black magic to kill the president himself".
"He enlisted the help of shamans from neighbouring Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguards, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, the prisoners were forced to drink a potion from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive the farm stay.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal's tenant: he's drowning in the furnaces, he signed a higher rent
An elderly man in custody walked out the door of the client center of RPG Byty "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a file under his arm, and in it were new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughters' and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
All three of them just got their rent raised by deregulation.
Instead of 3500 a month, my son will pay 4100 crowns for a 2+1 second category apartment from next year.
"There is no hot water, and the petrama must drown", the man points out in his son's new covenant, which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it", he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waves his hand over it.
"One says this, the other says that", he grimaces.
Ostrava is becoming a big deregulation lab.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are still not rented.
So, he decided to visit the lab personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirov is one of four in Ostrava, and it's full by 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
There's a security guard standing right next to the door with a trigger.
"2011 Rental", a special button on his touch screen lights up.
One tap, and the machine will print out a number.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already beeping on the big screen under the waiting room ceiling.
You're on in half a second.
The rent comes in a little later to ask an older couple, but the rush in the waiting room is obviously not about the new rent.
Most people came to deal with the usual problems as they used to - claims for repairs, insurance claims, and so on.
Letters with new leases have been arriving in Ostrava's mailboxes for most of the 44 thousand apartments in the RPG portfolio since about mid-November.
RPG Apartments has written to them proposing a 15 to 38 percent rent increase.
A special barrier for new rentals was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It's been going on for a week, so it's just getting started", the women behind the curtain respond after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a hot topic in the area.
Before the elections, he was caught by the deputy speaker of the parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after they're gone, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change the toilet seat", relieves the man mentioned at the outset.
Most of the time, according to the workers, the retirees are coming to see if they can get a discount on their rent if they sign on time, as the RPG special offers them.
Half discount on February rent, and other tenants who sign a new lease by December 15th.
The Havre deregulation barrier is certainly not overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 clients hired yesterday for 2011 there were only about 40 to 50 people", estimate the workers behind the curtain.
RPG suggests individual contract negotiations wherever needed on the website and on its walls.
However, if the parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal process", warns RPG on its website.
"No one will be prosecuted here", one of the RPG Apartments' workers thinks, and the man in the street in front of the client center partially agrees.
"I have 13,000 pension and I have 5,000 left for food, I don't have to sue", he says.
But the workers will get poor afterwards.
"We'll see about that".
"The media is telling them not to sign, so people are probably waiting", he reasoned.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still not even at the level necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock", says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who recalls that the neglect of the housing stock, which is being blamed by the angry tenant, is the main reason for the increase in rent, according to the homeowners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest 4 billion in apartments from rent, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, a large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the cushioned seats of the Haveri waiting room repeats several red-hued messages.
'The increase in rent in 2011 of 15% or less concerns 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments.'
"And it'll always be at most $1.50 per square foot and month", it appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will see their rents go up 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase is from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre", notes RPG.
2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation won't drive rentals off the ground, but will be spread out over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will be returned to the apartments, mainly for thermal savings - new windows and heating.
The people who sign the lease increase are the ones who get it.
The office includes a kindergarten, the architects understood.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to also conceal a mini-school with all its associated amenities - colorful walls, fancy furniture, a pile of toys, and even a miniature outdoor playground.
Since October last year, it has been open to the children of Arch.Design employees.
The architectural design company Arch.Design, whose studios have produced a number of important buildings in Brno, had been counting on space for its mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly baby boomers, and it cares about women designers and architects getting back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of reduced hours, the nursery is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under a social programme.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding work with child care.
The mini-school was designed by Arch.Design's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the Czech State budget.
Thanks to grant funding (grant of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and for two years to provide qualified staff and operations.
After the financial grant (2 years) is exhausted, Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took one year to prepare and the company Economy Rating was instrumental in the grant application.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, and are cared for by a nurse and a teacher at the school all day long. Children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, although most are over 3 years old.
Since it is a "mini-school", only five children may attend at a time, but more may be switched during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery regardless of the hierarchy of positions in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme content of the mini-school is comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they also receive quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school, including English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer for children to use.
The presence of young children in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and avoid stressful situations with late pick-ups from kindergartens far from the parents' workplace.
This makes the parents more productive.
It is not surprising that a loyal employee-employer relationship is naturally created here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program strengthened personnel marketing.
The bone house is still fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of an ancient lizard, the stairs look like the back of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The house was nicknamed the House of Bones by the locals because of its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The facade of the house is a play of dream lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When you look closely, you can see geometry, rhythm, and a well-thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, being illuminated to enhance the impression of bright colors.
The curvature and twisting of shapes to the same extent occurs in interiors.
Wood in waves mimics window frames, railings, door decorations, and peepholes and planks.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Gracia 43, was created by the reconstruction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló, the officer's house, but Antoni Gaudí did not design it himself.
He was assisted by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
Many other designers and artists worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs for Casa Batlló launched Jujola's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Güell Park, which houses other works by Gaudi.
The house was soon nicknamed "The House of Bones" by the locals because of its organic shapes.
Others have called it a "swinging house" because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows.
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted on the top of the building.
Hidden religious motifs contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Strange may seem their forty-five degree inclination.
Gaudí did not respect the building codes of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the start of construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data given by the city about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city council was shocked and asked for a repair.
For example, the council was upset that the building was interfering with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
The repair never took place, on the contrary: just 15 days after the city's call, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) a permit to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor had a social lounge and the bedroom and private part of the apartment on the third floor.
The ground floor was rented out to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building is lined with stairs that lead up to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of space interconnection.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the living room door and the larger company can communicate comfortably without losing the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received, in addition to the new facade, an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play with light, the blue and white glazed tiles that line the courtyard, and the lanterns are also impressive.
The two-color game provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was easy to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, is open to the public.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and luxurious apartment open to the public.
The owners decided to do so only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They persisted in the inspection, finding it to be a very profitable business and, moreover, extended the inspection to include common and attic areas, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee is certainly not negligible, at €16.50, and students, pensioners, groups and tourist cardholders enjoy a 20% discount.
The sum far exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the real atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you must quickly befriend one of the inhabitants of the apartment building and visit him directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grills: women have different requirements than men
Not the sumptuous frame of the bed, but the quality of the surface, the mattress and the grille, are the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmonised to suit the particular user.
Many factors determine the choice, from weight, height, age, health, to the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and grille are installed is also important.
Typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages where bats routinely bathe, as they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be turned over regularly.
If they do not have many vents in the core and are still on solid plates, they retain moisture: mold may also appear underneath.
Choice is also determined by habit.
Those who have spent time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softener are often used, will find it difficult to feel comfortable on low, hard surfaces.
"I guess all the hockey players coming back from the NHL complained that they couldn't sleep here".
"For their bruised shoulders, paws and hips, they needed a mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam".
"These are even recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that makes them misrepresent the 'information' from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamczik, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
That's why many hockey players and other customers needed flax foam mattresses years ago.
"Today it's all right, the right mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat it absorbs, or adapts to your warm body.
You're not pushed, you don't roll over at night like you've been through a tough fight.
You'll just sleep better.
Flaxseed foam also acts as a protection against bedbugs.
When choosing a mattress size, add the length of the foot to your height, which is usually about seven to eight inches [21 to 34 cm].
A man and a woman who are about six feet tall need a bed that's six to seven feet tall.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double, so 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For your convenience and possible visitation.
"Otherwise, the bed width rule is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly curved at the elbow", advises Helena Prokopová, a master of the Stools and Decorators Guild, who has been working on the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years and who lectures on it at trade schools.
In a double bed, each person needs a separate grille and mattress, but be careful when buying to adjust the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you have no choice but to mount grills at different heights, but you may not be able to do so for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring-shaped types at least 15 cm, of which at least 3 cm should be counted on the moulding and curing layer.
"You should definitely not feel the springs when you touch them or sit on the mattress", warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a certain type of grill.
Full-fledged beds with mattresses and underpants like conjoined twins have no place in bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, and you can't wash the soot, which is common nowadays.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters a night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will start to look like one big (and stuffy) grid.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about mattresses lasting up to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
But everything has its "buts".
So, practical advice from the sellers: For mattresses that are 120 or 140 centimeters wide, keep the removable cover on and add a mattress cover that can be easily removed and washed.
Although the mattress liners that are commonly made today are woven all over the perimeter, so when you untie it, you get two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation in larger types (and in one person) could resemble a fight between a lightweight in the ring and a heavyweight.
Do you have a hard disk instead of a grill in your bed?
I never will!
No more than a bed for one night's visit.
However, provide ventilation holes (if not already) for the board and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (including Taschenfederkern) and a coating of pepper.
Polyurethane mattresses are not suitable for this type of foundation.
For non-locking lamellar grids with 14 to 18 lamels, latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable, but you will always benefit from grids with a higher number of lamels, 28 or more, where the lamels in the thigh area are doubled and their rigidity can be adjusted.
The positioning lamellar grilles do not include spring-shaped mattresses, as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the lamellae, a shoulder cradle is also available.
This is a special grip that allows the sleeper to press or even tilt the sleeper's shoulder.
For men with "shoulders all over their backs", it's definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers are now remembering it, and in the "Gentlemen's" they have begun to use a softening zone in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface at the hip.
For the most demanding customers, wings or slabs with so-called multitooling are designed.
The pressure is distributed in multiple points and the voltage is reduced.
Of course, once you use the wrong pillow (big and "smooth") on the right mattress and grille, most of the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips should only touch the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
The appropriate size is recommended to be 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance (together with the shoulder cradle of the grille or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straw-filled grass beds.
The reason is that manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least ingredients.
It's just that the trend is mattress bio.
The petroleum raw materials used to make polyurethane foams are replaced by natural oils such as hops and soybeans.
So, soy is used by almost every major manufacturer.
"The bio of mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin", explains Petr Vašiček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress linings, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There are also separate men's and women's sections.
While a man is "cool" by a plant extract from the birch to allow the mattress's sweat to absorb heat and cool the body, women are "melted" by the sheets.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
The favorite of the day?
The mattress made of cold foam (with larger pores and a broken cellular structure) is more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combining different hardnesses of cold foam and "lazy" foam, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where to place the head, thighs, and heels.
You'll pay from seven thousand crowns and up for a good mattress.
Those that meet the health criteria, have a lower VAT rate, are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first company in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage.
It's not easy to save on mattresses and grills.
Sometimes, for example, promotions by manufacturers or retailers may be used, offering two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with all Memory foam in the lid for $11,990.
The other one, of course, is free.
The era of lazy, or viscoelastic, foams with open cell structures and high density was ushered in at a "cosmic" pace by the material Tempur.
It was originally created as a NASA material because astronauts were exposed to enormous overload during launch.
Temperature softened in warmth, solidified in cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warmth of the human body and distributes the pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal for preventing bedwetting, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in medical products, such as special foot pads that relieve the leg and the vascular system.
Domestic producers use Eucatherm C foam, Twinsaver and the like.
People-tracking devices want more and more parents, so they want to watch their children
Fear of their own child is leading more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system, originally designed to track cars, can also track people's movements, helping in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatkov.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it may be as big as a watch.
Many people were terrified by the disappearance of Annika and began to search for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that it is not spying, but another means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in certain cases, there may be misuse of such devices, such as when they are put in the bag of someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case".
"Mostly, customers actually buy it for safety reasons", Pilin added.
He said that a child should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bochko warns that if a child does not want to wear something like this, he will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how they willfully lose things when they don't want to be in control".
"Parents used to have high expectations for cell phones, but they can be turned off just like these surveillance devices", says Bočková.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of an attempted kidnapping, the perpetrator will virtually always make sure that the child has no electronic devices that could reveal his location".
"Now it's the phone".
"As surveillance devices become more widespread, they will be sought after, because their sales will surely be fueled by massive advertising".
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can help.
'The device can be set to transmit the position periodically after a certain time.'
'If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available.'
"More expensive devices have in-built tilt meters, so even if a person slips and remains motionless, the device will send out an immediate warning with a position indicator", says Čech.
He said that a similar service could be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, which could be accessed by downloading special software.
The problem with the current surveillance units is that they're either devices the size of matchboxes or smaller mobile phones.
They're always in danger of being lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, therefore, a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that the potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all".
"Or he will only know them after a while and that may give the police extra time", he adds.
Whether the tracking devices evolve into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology as is used for vehicle surveillance.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (used by standard car navigation systems) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has enough firewood to cover the Czech Republic, but it will only last two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ropes to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Department of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of rope to the warehouses.
The army has 225 years' supply.
The problem is, the rope lasts two, four years at most.
The army bought the fire hoses from the stock company STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES's fire hoses, wrote that the soldiers in training use 60 kilometers of lighters a year.
However, the calculations of military pyrotechnics consulted by MF DNES show that then all generals, army command officers, secretaries and cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
The Minister of Defence Alexander Vondru and the Army Chief Vlastimil Pikk are not exempt.
That's the only way to justify the army's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of matches.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were, the army's reserves would last for more than a decade.
On the other hand, if it were true that for basic training of each new professional, experts say, only two meters of firewood is needed, the army has secured supplies for the 225 years by fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of marines or special units.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondrov personally that they have almost no ammunition for handguns, so even shooting is limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I can't believe they're buying so many matches from us over and over again".
"But it's their decision, and they know what they're getting".
"For us, the military is a good customer, and as businessmen we try to satisfy them", says Jan Děcký, sales manager at STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies the hundreds of kilometers of rope purchased by saying that the army will have supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, speaks of a lighter's life span of only four years, and that of a police or military pyrotechnic even of only two years.
"In perfect storage, it could be all four", says one, who as a soldier refuses to be named because of criticism from the military.
After the end of their life, each round must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
But these tests are not free and cost extra.
The next argument the department makes is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of fire cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers", explains spokesman Pejšek, according to the Ministry of Defense's purchasing position.
Just for comparison, the annual consumption of the firing line of police pyrotechnics, who are destroying ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order just enough to use up the ammo before it expires.
She has proven herself to be a safe pyrotechnic, and she can also be more flexible in acquiring more modern and therefore more reliable types of rope.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable trouble disposing of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000 Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech fire brigade, according to the pyrotechnicians contacted by MF DNES, is facing the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which today "lacino" buys.
I'm still drawing on the contacts I made through the competition.
The winner of the "Citizen of the Year" competition helped Lukasz Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year's "Professor of the Year" competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberc.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And while abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
With his savings from the foreign brigades and a bank loan, he bought a half-destroyed five-unit house.
For a third-year college student at the time, that was a lot of courage.
"The quality-price ratio at the time did not prevent me from trying to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first apartment to be renovated was rented to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, in seven years of business, it has gradually succeeded in opening four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of more than 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun Design Hotel.
But this year, he got another one, just as good.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel on Tisa Island, where we sold our franchise concept, and more people are interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise", says last year's number one.
"And the hotel license sale was largely due to the winner of the "Citizen of the Year" contest", adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the streets, often complimented me, and I must say it was nice", he recalls.
I would definitely recommend the contest to anyone who's trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have otherwise had.
"Some of the people I met through competition, I started doing business with regularly".
He felt that the glory associated with success had a certain effect on each employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I see a greater loyalty and pride in being involved in something that has gained universal recognition".
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of all of us working together".
"Only my name is put forward", says Lukáš Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at the Farm.
The euphoria of victory was quickly eclipsed by the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the winner's determination, Farmet has had a rough time.
Last year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, won the first prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
The jury then praised the efforts he had made to build a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions from a small tool shop in České Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and has given us confidence to fight the competition", says last year's winner today.
The beginning of Farmet's history was the desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karl Žďárský's father a small workshop to rent as compensation for the Communists' confiscation of property, he did not hesitate for long, rejected a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father, they started a company for plastic baths.
Soon they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater publicity, even among the lay public, after its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners started to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
But last year was not just a victory euphoria at the Farm.
The valuation was based on the company's economic results up to 2008 and only partially on 2009.
And 2009 was the worst year for engineering sales.
The crisis had reached its peak, and had not yet affected the citizens as much as it did, but companies were already halting their investment projects and beginning to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, we have not been spared this situation".
"Productions fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and there were layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed to keep the company profitable, even if it was less than before the crisis.
But what they didn't discount at Farmet is the investment in research and development.
"With the grants, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs, won major awards at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that removes nonsensical rules
The Absurdity of the Year poll is the fourth part of the business clan.
Some of the nonsense regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdity of the Year poll has become the mandatory carrying of documents to the office, which are also available to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 votes cast.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper statement from the business register, even though an official can get it with two mouse clicks.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register during checks on insurance payers", said spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
To shed light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to abolish the nonsense ones is the purpose of the contest Absurdity of the Year.
This is the fourth edition of the business pageant organized by the Economist newspaper and is gaining popularity among the public.
If last year there were about three thousand voters, this year there are almost four thousand.
And no wonder, all kinds of legal obligations that serve only to delay business, we still have plenty and plenty.
"We are perhaps the world's leading tax registers", says Karel Havlíček of the Czech Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders.
In recent years, the simplification of business has become a proclaimed objective of all governments.
But the situation in the Czech Republic is not much better than in the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of conditions for doing business, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually under the same scenario.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April until the end of September, when the competition closes.
The competition organiser will then select seven candidates for the "anticen" and have the public vote for it during October via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey included more than 100 - 105 - meaningless regulations.
The guys were from the business community, but also the unions and the press.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, the nominated ones included, for example, the requirement that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place every early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the event, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic, assisted in the culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state is throwing clubs at entrepreneurs, so I aim to repeal every year at least three dozen paragraphs that today only unnecessarily complicate business", said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to overturn a nonsensical regulation does not sound in vain.
In 2007, the most common practice was the obligation for entrepreneurs to notify the trade office at the place where the permanent establishment is located three days in advance of their intention to take the stand to an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was abolished by the amendment of the Trade Act.
The second most voted requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a business trip of up to 30 days for its foreign employee, was abolished by the so-called Green Card Act.
And to the third, good luck.
The absurdity of 2009 was the requirement for physical therapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two folding scales in their office.
That was eased this year by a Health Ministry decree - the requirement to have a refrigerator was dropped.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects shall be evaluated.
The fifth annual Economics Newspaper competition is a new category, the Responsible Company of 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote sound and fair business.
"We want to support companies that consider the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
For the first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Firma 2010 main competition, companies for which business success is not the only long-term objective have applied.
Each one's story is so inspiring, I'd write a separate article about it.
Although their activities are diametrically different, the common denominators of their efforts can be considered to be support and consideration.
In one case, it concerns, for example, people with disabilities, and in another case, it concerns personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 national finalists was the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a series of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to a charity fund for disabled children for 17 years.
The Poděbrad paper mill, which has more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, takes care of them and therefore won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionate reduction in pay.
The jury also awarded her the title for her preferential purchases from Czech producers, her support of civic activities in the surrounding area and her environmental conservation.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains Miluše Ryznarová, the coordinator.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecký Region, on the other hand, thinks about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its company events.
"In addition, we support the Foundation Man in Need, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activities of the company Praní a čišćení from Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses, are also worth mentioning.
"We, in turn, contribute to food, transport, training and recreation", says Josef Strapáč of Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
The following are the results of the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
In the absence of any other information, the Commission concluded that the measures in question were not appropriate.
'If the representatives of the competing firms did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition for Responsible Firm of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the 'main' competition Vodafone Firm of the Year.'
"It is not possible to apply for this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main competition for the Firm of the Year", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested in a public competition
The anti-corruption police arrested her in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in the past few days.
Detectives have tracked down local media mogul and real estate developer Lubosi G.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
He was to pay Luboši G. half a million crowns for it.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for offenses of bribery in public procurement and in public competition", said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Plzeň prosecutor's office, to Pravda, adding that further details regarding the ongoing investigation could not be provided.
A 46-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
The extent to which it could have affected the public tender is only speculative given the minimal amount of official information available.
Spokeswoman Lubomira Černá of the Land Fund, when asked by Práva, said that at a secluded workplace in Pilsen, police officers did arrest people during a public competition.
"It was a client, not an employee", she said.
The tender is entitled 'Call for tenders for the transfer of land under the Land Act' and is held if more than one eligible applicant is interested in the land offered.
'These persons offer, under the call, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land.'
"According to the claims offered, the order of acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims", the spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who had applied for the invitation to tender and, being himself also a beneficiary, having acquired a number of restitution claims, offered the applicant the land to opt out of the competition.
He must have collected severance for it.
That would explain why he had so much money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had above-average contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for giving in substitute restitution land on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the motorway to the industrial zone Borská pole was to be built.
Later, he traded them very advantageously with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city, which was of much higher value.
The city had to agree to this, otherwise the blockade would have jeopardized the construction.
Households pay hundreds of dollars a month for housing
Households will have to pay for not only all kinds of energy, but also water and heating, and in some places rent will rise.
Families will have to withdraw up to hundreds of crowns more per month from their wallets from January.
Electricity will be up 4.6 percent, gas will be up about 2 percent, and in some cities you'll have to pay a tenth more for water, and in many cities, central heating will be up.
Electricity prices in households should be a hundred crowns less per year than they are now.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the reasons for the decrease in the price of electricity from renewable sources.
Gas is rising slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and are consuming the most.
So they're also looking at hundreds of crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are rising across the country, the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increases are planned mainly by the larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradce Králové will pay about 50 CZK extra per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 CZK per year.
In Prague, residents are threatened with more than 9 percent higher water and sanitation charges if the city raises infrastructure rents.
If the rent stays the same, the fried will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lowest in the whole of the Republic.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage are set to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rents of the 450,000 apartments, where the regulations will end in January, may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who don't agree to the new rent increase, he's going to take the company to court.
The regulated rents people pay in about 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk on Fernet and rum, beer is out of fashion, it's slow-acting.
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally good brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often end up in the care of doctors when drunken people are under the age of 15.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital.
This is the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the entrances of children's wards.
"Some beers or wines are completely out of fashion because it takes a long time to get drunk on them".
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol", said Luděk Pelikán, the head of the children's department at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"If they can get Daddy's bottle out of the cupboard, it's probably whiskey, but otherwise it's fernet and vodka".
"The advantage of vodka is that it is poured into the juice and doesn't smell as much", the mayor explained.
And the spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurin, is also telling the truth.
"It's usually fernet or rum".
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was a plum they had brought from home", Jurin said.
According to the mayor of Pelican, 13- or 14-year-old drunks in hospital admissions are a fairly common occurrence.
Before starting his practice in Hořovice this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric unit in Motol, where ambulances are bound to distract schoolchildren from the surrounding area.
"One girl had been laid at our house about four times".
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought to us with 3.5 milligrams of alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Holešovice for some dance party".
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't find it strange that she hadn't known about her daughter for 48 hours", the mayor said.
Parental disinterest or even considerable tolerance of drinking by their offspring is considered a major cause of the rising number of children who are drinking.
However, experts say that there is no such thing as a true child addiction.
"Alcoholics are chronically dependent on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that go with it, and this is not the case in children".
"Those who drink repeatedly are more likely to have a poor family-social background", explained Mayor Pelikán.
According to Jurin's spokesman, this year, the pediatric clinic in Motol has admitted about 40 drunken children by mid-November.
But only those with severe intoxication who have had to stay in the hospital are included in the statistics.
Kid drunkards who are taken away from the hospital by their parents or taken home by the police are not counted.
Besides the kids just sitting around after school drinking a bottle of booze, there are three seasonal fluctuations Pelican says you can count on: the witches, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"They either drink the grief of a bad report or celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"I've seen seven drunken children at once at the reception", the Pelican pointed out.
Paradoxically, a drunk who spends the night in detox under medical supervision has an advantage over one who endures an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will trigger the hydration infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body is lacking.
"They are actually better off because they have a good wake-up call after a good evening experience and they don't feel any pain".
"They're just confused about where they are", admitted Pelican, admitting that sometimes they spoil patients' good mood by at least counting the cost of their treatment.
The ambulance and the hospital's emergency room costs tens of thousands of crowns.
"I sometimes used this as a teaching tool, telling the children directly at the visit how much their drinking cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to earn money for the one party", added Pelican.
However, he argued that the health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures in which they recover the costs of treatment from the parents in cases of child drunkenness.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s, out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged for a Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, where Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturers are based, on Tuesday.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of anyone other than the Czech army.
They've only been abroad for training or demonstration years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1 which was previously operated by the Czech Army and which was airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
They're still in storage at Air Supply and a brokerage firm, Omnipol, took them over last week.
When the planes will physically leave the Void, according to Jan Pešek of the Defense Press Department, is not yet known.
'The L-159 single-seaters for exchange were selected from long-standing aircraft without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.'
"Two-seat L-159T1s were replaced in their current condition and form", said Prava Pejšek.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seaters, as the ministry signed a 200 million crown contract with Aer Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unnecessary L-159s into two two-seaters.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to the Foot, the EADS has committed to the adoption of the aircraft into the armaments of an Allied country.
'The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft will be purchased by EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.'
"It is therefore up to the customer how it will implement this thing", said Pejšek.
The economic newspapers reported a while ago that the Spanish army, for example, is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not submit a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The then defence leadership argued that in exchange it would support future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 of these from Aero and is only using 24, the rest they want to sell.
The purchase of Casa's planes will likely have a legal precedent.
The European Commission has taken the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice for having selected the aircraft on the basis of a European-wide tender and not by referring to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last of which should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in two weeks.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of cancer
Men who have a forefinger longer than the ring have a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It could be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results suggest that the relative length of a finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially when combined with genetic risk or other risk factors, such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a pointer on their right hand shorter than their ring finger.
They were as likely to get prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers.
However, for those with a forefinger longer than the ring, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men by age 60, it was down by 87 percent.
The length of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the baby is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer reading.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is the one that promotes prostate cancer growth.
Leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech News Agency that he was familiar with the study, but that he did not think the relationship between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly snow-covered, and in many places, road users have been driving all night.
The D5 highway between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and there is also D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The Central Automobile Club (CAC) dispatcher told the news.
There was a truck crash at mile 91, two trucks collided at mile 93, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should either get off just behind Brno at 190 kilometres or drive through Brno and then drive to 182 kilometres on the Kývalce.
They form in columns several miles long.
There's also an accident on the D11 motorway, just before the entrance to Prague.
Prague is covered in several centimeters of snow, and the temperature is minus seven degrees Celsius.
Cars are being built on Prosek, for example.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the route between Charles Square and Peace Square.
Prague's emergency team is scheduled to reconvene at 8:00 a.m.
The railways and airports are also experiencing problems.
The Czech railways have already had to cancel seven high-speed trains because of the snow.
The problem lies, for example, in the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday until 5am.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are now paved, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovska, three side roads are impassable, in Brno, places form snow tongues and in Blanenska, they are necessary to overcome some communications in the upper parts of the snow chain.
The most affected areas were the Viskov region.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They'll need to be stretched with milling machines.
When they'll be passed, there's no telling.
On Hodoninska, caution is required in the White Carpathian area.
The roads, which are maintained by inert spraying to protect nature, are covered with up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, reported the CTC.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, most of it in northern Czechia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually receding.
The American military has a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small super-precision cannon.
Its missiles are guided by lasers with a precision of several meters.
The special 25mm rounds developed for this rifle, containing a highly explosive explosive charge, actually act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to detonate not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
The top is usually unprotected, and a deadly rain of steel shards can knock him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier treats it basically by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, determining the distance, getting a precise point of focus, adjusting the caliber accordingly, and pressing the button".
"Let's say you measured 543 meters".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires a projectile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters", Audette said.
400 jobs to be relocated
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace next July from the existing administrative building in Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As announced on Wednesday, the giant in the industry, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, will move 400 men and women from its current administrative building in Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyons Street in the Niederrad section of Frankfurt, next July.
According to the spokesman of Fujista, another 100 Group jobs, which are currently spread across the region, should be relocated there in the near future.
The rental offer was very attractive and the large office space in Astro Park was more suited to the way the employees worked.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central office with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent airport connectivity is of particular importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of a major company within the region caused yesterday's victory to be a joy and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt Chief Economic Adviser Markus Frank (CDU) said that this had succeeded in gaining a "global player".
It's a "fantastic show of trust in this location".
Fujitsu is a good fit for the city, and settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed in good time by the company's management of his intention.
"Of course we offered the company our help", Corwisi said.
But the friendly contacts could not change the computer manufacturer's trouble with the landlord of the Marienbader-Platz.
The result was economic reasons.
Now it's a matter of avoiding a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperative".
The house on Rathaus Square, which Fujitsu has used up to now, and the adjacent "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed building projects in the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Square.
The station was built as a joint project between the city and the City Hall by a private developer, the so-called city entrance, which was criticized both for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as parking lots and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still linked to Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurt-Hahn-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides, for example, computers and servers to companies and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but the majority of Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park administration building, 7,000 square metres were rented for this purpose.
The complex, whose name is a reference to the starry floor plan, is 20 years old and is home to the central association of the electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon is shutting down the server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon has disabled the discovery platform on its servers.
It's possible that this was done under political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in the UK.
WikiLeaks, the disclosure platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is expected to be held, according to a news report in the UK.
"WikiLeaks is no longer on Amazon".
"Free speech in the land of the free", activists said on Wednesday (local time) via the short-message service Twitter.
Shortly before that, the Internet company Amazon had downloaded the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage the high number of accesses to documents in publishing secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks explained the move on Twitter: "Okay - we're going to spend our dollars now by employing people in Europe".
If Amazon has such problems with free speech, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after allegedly investigating Senator Joe Lieberman's associates, CNN reported, citing information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee has threatened to boycott Amazon, reports the British "Guardian".
"I used to wish Amazon had taken this step sooner, given the earlier release of classified information on WikiLeaks", the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, outrageously and recklessly, and is putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet", said a statement from an unbiased senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should assist WikiLeaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
Based on a report in London's Independent newspaper, a 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, and Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden a ploy by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there had been threats.
"There have even been calls for the assassination of Julian Assange".
That's why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the WikiLeaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently reacting to statements from North America.
In the United States, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has called for the person responsible for the WikiLeaks leaks to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television - perhaps ironically - that Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, a verbal exchange between the White House and Assange erupted.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to step down if she was responsible for the recently released espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with a website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website".
The U.S. government is now conducting a major security review of its databases.
The special representative has been appointed by the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" needed after the embassy reports were published on WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the way the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they were put in danger by publication on WikiLeaks.
"We have made every effort to contact them", said Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of Ice Cream
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers is highly sought after and attracts visitors from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, the Czech-style ice cream man, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelataio will take the ice cream out of the freezer with a mop, put it in a wrapper and sell it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't avoid the Gelato-University, an Italian company called Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream maker set up an ice cream university to make the ice cream from its machines match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day Gelatieri Foundation Course is a major attraction, drawing visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also special courses on chocolate ice cream and an internship at the ice cream shop.
Some people crave a new career in their midlife crisis, others venture on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke, a business consultant in Berlin, wants to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man in Malta and one in Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars -- and the Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only the taste, but also the softness and consistency of the silk.
Luciano remembers during his training the Southern and Patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there's a nice dose of romance".
The first step of manufacturing seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powder, sugar, and stabilizers - into a large blender, which heats everything electronically to 85 degrees and then instantly cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the tap on the machine and drains out the pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the assistant professor is overwhelmed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream from natural ingredients alone without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns against being carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Those who say that ice cream is "only made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - mostly natural products, such as guar flour made from guar grains.
Of course, you can make ice cream without stabilizers, but you have to sell it within a day or it will crash and the customer will eat all the ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
It's more exciting with the aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
And there are pills and creams.
"The additives will try to force you to have a lot of flavored ingredients".
"But you should just experiment".
Be with fruit sorbet and sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream made of white solids that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now he can take the ice cream machine course.
Luciano always has them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and melon ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be done with fruit ice cream.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - in terms of flavor, it's not always better.
A fox nut ice cream may not taste more nutty if it contains more fox nuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the mix is balanced will it pick up the right flavor of gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach purees with a lot of sugar are used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out the device that measures the sugar content of the fruit (wine growers use it to measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
The manufacture of ice cream is no longer as physically demanding as it once was.
It's not just a machine that helps to produce the basic stuff automatically.
There is also a machine that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to minus temperature.
With all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a giant blender spirals out of control.
"In any course", Maestro Luciano believes, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Double-light auditors
The European Food Authority EFSA is linked to the industry that experiments with genetically modified plants.
This is now the accusation of a group of experts at Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well", said Christoph Then, head of the Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of EFSA's expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the ILSI lobbying group for several years.
It's funded by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the EFS control regulations for genetic plants and is thus clearly in conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The EFSA regulations are said to be identical in their entirety to the Ilsi documents, thus bearing the handwriting of an industry which should be controlled by the Parma office in Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has raised the issue of a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Ephesus switched sides by joining the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any allowances or transitional period.
Also, the Radio for Central Germany (MDR) recently revealed the personal links between the EU-control office and the industrial lobby, which aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't see the conflict of interest.
All the serious data, including those from industry, if of high technical quality, are covered by a single statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But they have to prove it.
Kuiper admits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for assessing the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that GM crops are currently allowed in animals without any feeding experiments and that no tests are being conducted to test the reactions of genetic plants to environmental influences.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize will do in the field", says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which will not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how can you find them?" asks Prosecutor Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
So there are hardly any scientists left who aren't connected to corporations.
Studies that are critical to society are often not published.
"Industry controls the research on security", Hilbeck believes.
The stone footprint
Uli Gsell also bought some, about 400 kilograms in total.
Monday night, he was standing in front of the train station in Stuttgart, tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story goes, in September, the bulldozers came and began to tear off a large section of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar reduction in train stations.
When the construction was halted, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken up into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim lime, a soft coarse stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"He must not disappear".
It melts: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original".
When he cut one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former ammunition dump of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man deals in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were made during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed to pieces or disappeared in a landfill", he says in his office, a wooden booth that was once a nursing home.
He says he was threatened and slandered when all the papers in September said he bought the remains of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he's been talking to S-21 adversaries for days.
And he explained to them that he had nothing to do with the demolition.
And since that's happening, it's probably the wisest thing to do if the stones are still being used.
Then about 200 S-21s took each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memento, some also hope to return it when it is rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest sold out.
Gardeners, landscapers, home builders. They're all the same.
They came from all over and dragged what was in the trunk and the trailer.
Stuttgart's disputed stones have long since been transformed into "walls" or the edges of herb gardens.
"This stone is nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political stuff".
He gets in his SUV and takes a ride around his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law, dropped out, then biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
The brakes.
There are artificially crafted sand dunes in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Marien-Brücke in Dresden", he relates.
The sandman from Lab, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favourite stone".
We're going up the road through the woods.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on and on.
"Beautiful travertine" is what I'm saying.
Once the paintings belonged to the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the church of St. Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported by simple plowshares and bull-drawn carts, he becomes quite reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to crush".
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
But the stone merchant now employs 14 people, and besides, a stonemason, a sculptor, a smith, a glassmaker, and a gardener have settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the one evaluating the leftovers.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There will also be a stone rescue.
The battle of the talent for high-potential
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are squeezed over salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW's developers, they're here to talk about the car of the future - and just to get to know Volkswagen, by the way.
Many companies are trying to win the competition for the smartest heads, like VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates into the classroom as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of the success of their students, companies are trying to discover and recruit exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is looking to recruit talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department is handing out pens, rubber bears, and VW logo plates.
He tells the young talent about internship programs, student jobs, and directions to the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is running the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both parties: "Students get to know the industry and gain experience".
"VW can get to know the students at the same time, get to know the interesting candidates and decide who would be a good partner".
Such cooperation, according to Sella, is not uncommon.
But the new thing is, he's so open about his students.
"It was more of a substantial professional project", says Selle.
The battle for freshmen is probably gonna be even tougher.
In many sectors, firms are no longer able to select their employees from a long list of candidates.
On the contrary, they must strive and strive to attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, engineering graduates are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the VDI, the German Engineering Association, 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And VDI predicts the so-called engineering shortage will continue to grow.
Roman Dykta is going to KPMG, an audit and consulting firm, to find talent.
It organises challenging Recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt in which participants must find their way by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the U.S. next year.
At the same time, participants can visit KPMG's branches and get to know the company.
The selection of participants will be decided in advance in two rounds.
Only Crème de la Crème of the many applicants will fly to the United States.
In the battle for High Potentials, the universities will be subject to increasingly harsh laws dictated by the Dictator.
"We want to be different from the rest of the Race".
"A simple sailboat trip was too little for us".
It seems the talent scout Dictator is in luck.
"We've been in touch with all the participants in similar events last year".
"Some will soon be graduating and planning to apply for jobs with us", she says.
In addition to direct campus appeals, SMEs are the main players in the labour market.
"We're trying to contact graduates at trade shows".
"As at Intersolar, for example", says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe is aware of the problems of young workers.
At present, 35 positions are listed on the company's website.
"It's difficult to fill vacancies right now".
"It takes a lot of time and money", he says.
Another option is to contact university professors.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as the University of Freiburg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do an internship or write a thesis".
The solar specialist doesn't run any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to lure in other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy, and easy communication.
"Big corporations often cannot offer this", says Stübe, head of the personnel department.
Money has long ceased to be a major factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good access to care are other factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and the framework conditions for employees are monitored.
Head of Personnel, Stübe, hopes the position will earn her points from jobseekers.
"I think that applicants are particularly interested in external evaluations of a potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Krieger, that means primarily internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees", he says.
This is called internal employer branding, which is the promotion of the employer in the marketplace amongst its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
If a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will self-promote their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with a rope", says Kriegler.
Obama is shutting down new oil wells
No new oil wells will be drilled off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the next few years.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban, effectively canceling the previous plans.
New drilling is also banned off the Atlantic coast.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which is expected to last at least the next five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
In the wake of the disaster, which killed 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is British energy conglomerate BP, which is facing billions in claims.
The Obama-appointed commission of inquiry is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban he'd been paying since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and stricter safety regulations.
The Audit Office, which has been the subject of numerous corruption allegations, is currently undergoing a major reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will drastically reduce the amount of oil being mined in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest drag on the growth of the oil and gas industry", according to a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulatory changes will be".
Investment in new mining projects is shifting until the recall - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of oil leakage have destroyed the environment in Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption and illegal oil production.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry", reassures an environmental activist: "You'll get plenty of oil mud in front of your lens today".
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched as an attempt was made to photograph a boy wading through water surrounded by mosses, a scene that is almost beautiful in the glow of the rainbow.
That the brown deposits of oil float beneath the surface, you can't see.
She used to collect enough shrimp in containers here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the water slowly became dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil was spilled into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: The Ogoni region, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-infected areas in the world.
The entire extent of the desert is only visible along the mangrove swamps with many tributaries.
The boat's engine boils brown porridge instead of clear water, and if you dip your hand in the water, you'll get your oil fingers out.
The roots of the mangroves stick out of the ground like black liqueur stalks, and the rare palm leaves hang sadly.
We search in vain for the swarm of birds that normally inhabit the wetlands: Once the engine on the boat is silent, it settles in its former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrifying silence.
"What is happening here is an ecological war", sadly says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant fear of health".
The comparison to war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European conquerors arrived, the first resistance was formed here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and Shell had to stop production there in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire delta area, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipeline carrying more than two million barrels of black gold, is being mined daily, the oil field in the Ogoni area is in shambles, making the situation very unstable for the company.
Every few hundred yards, steel structures are spun out of the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", as they are affectionately called, boreholes.
They're 50 years old, mostly turkey-sized.
At any moment, one of the drill heads will break, Akpobari says, and then a steady stream of oil will leak into the water.
Experts estimate that over 50 years, more than two billion gallons of oil have leaked into the delta's ecosystem - the same amount of oil each year as was released into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago by the Exxon Valdez supertanker disaster - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There is a debate over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell says that sabotage and organized theft of oil account for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists point to bursting wellheads and unsealed pipes as the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, complained U.S. scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: "Only the number of failures on the pipelines is several times higher than elsewhere".
In what from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-soiled workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves under the open sky: completely naked and oil-to-the-neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by pipes, partly scattered arbitrarily across the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, who leads the group.
First it leaks out of the pipe into the gasoline trap, then it drips kerosene at the end of the pipe, and finally it drips petroleum.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four barrels of 300 liters each each each day: "We make $34,000" - about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing state in Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can be overtaken by illegal producers: they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to pipelines throughout the Ogoni region: experts say that the country is losing at least 16 million litres of oil a day throughout the Niger Delta.
But only a negligible portion of the raw material that is provisionally stored is illegally refined: The largest portion is loaded onto tankers by organized crime networks, which are believed to include politicians and high-ranking military officials, and sold on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their intervention or the lax production method, Akpobari considers purely academic.
"If the oil companies did not consider themselves intruders and if they did not destroy the fishermen's livelihood completely, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries".
Meanwhile, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so badly damaged that he is considering leaving the company: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will be shown to be better".
Michael is disturbed.
"It's high time you disappeared", says the muscle-builder.
"The soldiers may come any minute".
If they were found by a special military unit, they wouldn't face jail time, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who are mostly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"Here the cursed thing has taken our country in every respect to the bottom", says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous engineering flaw in the A380 engines.
The A380 has a major safety flaw.
Investigators found a possible engineering error in the crashed plane that could have led to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Airlines wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas passengers may have had better luck than previously known when they made an emergency landing in early November: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority has identified a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible engineering error.
The failure could have serious consequences: one oil line could be cracked due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380s.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against a British turbine manufacturer.
It has filed a statement of grounds in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company will seek damages for an incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were loose and they damaged the bearings.
Rolls-Royce has blamed the damage on burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the giant aircraft equipped with the engines.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security deficiency was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet grounded for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Snowfall across the country will cause traffic chaos
Germany in white: snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, with train and airline connections disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost the entire republic went down in freezing temperatures on Thursday night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to six inches [15 cm] of snow is in places.
Several highways and many roads are heavily restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not cope with the newly-arrived snow.
There was also a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm surge on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein this morning with water levels 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowfall caused considerable problems on the motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to Meteomedia, the worst-case scenario in Saxon Switzerland has reached a purple alert level - the highest ever.
In some areas, up to 30 centimeters of new snow fell, and strong, fresh winds caused a blizzard.
Several trucks and passenger cars stayed overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major problems on the roads.
The wind and snow have caused slow traffic and congestion on the A2.
There was snow trouble on the A4 and A9 in Durynsk.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Durin and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the rails, overturned trees on the rails or broken overhead lines and bends.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
At the Saalfeld in Durin, an ICE must have stopped for Munich.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers on board the train.
Snow winds blowing over the roads.
Many flights were canceled at major German airports because of the snow-blasting winds.
According to the spokesman of the flight information center, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt nach Mohanem, the spokesman for Fraport said it had been canceled for 40 years.
Road maintenance is on a permanent basis.
Although few passengers remain unconnected at the airport, 400 field beds are available for them.
Many accidents have occurred on the roads as early as Wednesday evening.
A truck driver died tonight in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of a snow-covered road: Here too, a lorry was caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train, and the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the early hours of the morning.
And a 30-year-old woman died after her car overturned on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the good news is that the snow will remain a light powder, so even light gusts of wind will lift it.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong winds.
It's going to be a very cold winter, though, up to minus 15 degrees in the area.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for the twin towers
Deutsche Bank is bidding farewell to its brand: according to a newspaper article, the bank is looking for a buyer for two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district had been modernized; meanwhile, bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group seems to want the renovation costs back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, reports the "Financial Times Deutschland" citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still exploring whether it makes more sense to own or sell property and then rent it out again", he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany is thus once again relinquishing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The Bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from equity investors and subsequently undertook a costly renovation.
The energy conversion cost is estimated at around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed Greentowers, at around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the trust or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
More than 10,000 people have paid tribute to the memory of the flooded miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
No bodies have been recovered as the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners, aged 17 to 62, were dumped in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but it found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and the ensuing explosions, the rescue forces were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second powerful explosion, authorities and experts felt that the miners had no chance of survival.
Still no way to free the dead.
Now they honor the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the memory of the drowned miners, 29 tables were erected, on which were helmeted, lanterns and names of the miners.
Pictures and personal items like clothes and surfboards also found their place.
The flags were flown at half-mast over the state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would once again emerge from "the depths of the earth", New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative event.
"But they never came home".
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the mine.
The commemoration event was attended by several foreign diplomats, in addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims.
British and South African miners were also flooded during the explosion on November 19.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the toxic gases are dissolved, the high temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you warriors!
Is horror a good movie for the arts?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to push back the old boundaries with his war epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think he had in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents at large with almost supernatural force - this sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods and even wrestles his enemies from the gut alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed Man, as he is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters either utter one or two sentences at most or are drawn into a passionate dying scream.
Otherwise, they are silent and play in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings some 1,000 years ago.
The film is ideal for adult film enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good when a film has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to bring his works either more humor to the mainstream or less brutal artistic audiences.
Most artists seem to be discouraged by the brain and guts that are sprayed everywhere.
Action movie fans will be bored at the very latest when the One-Eyed Man, for obvious reasons, sails to Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries and hangs out in the windless fog for eternity before the crew apparently reaches America and is silent.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" was not released in Germany and is now only available on DVD.
It's a pity, not only because of the beautiful images, but also because behind the peculiar façade, the places covered with blood, there is a thrilling cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a precise plot, it's all about the atmosphere, the fever dream that became the movie.
And there's no escape for the viewer.
Refn doesn't give him a moment's relief and slowly suffocates him with his chilling footage and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with the indescribable hatred that gushes from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps One-Eyed Man retains some semblance of innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become, in time, to enemies and transient allies, a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It represents destruction, perhaps, but only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
The Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA has a new alert on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is not open to expression - nor does it allow for control.
At around midnight on September 5th to 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It is located on the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 20 miles [30 km] away, and it is called Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it refers to a reactor that was allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that is off-stream.
According to a US-CIA foreign intelligence report from late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium - which could be used to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the '50s is no good for anything else.
The CIA presented a video of the unfocused satellite imagery.
She used computer animation to explain where the reactor components could have been before the destruction, which is said to be a scaled-down replica of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, photographs were presented that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much is known about it, and the riddles have even grown over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious, referring only to the "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation "credible".
They're missing clear evidence, and so is the IAEA.
When asked how sure he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said last summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly cleared the area of what they claimed to be "unused military buildings" and leveled the ground.
Yet in June 2008, a team led by former IAEA inspector general Olli Heinonen managed to find traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received via the Member State satellite photographs of commercial dealers from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - possibly Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program and never built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus has said.
But that was dismissed by the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Damascus has refused to discuss the matter ever since, as have the satellite images.
In addition, he forbade auditors from conducting a second inspection at el-Kibar and from accessing the wreckage of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment", the official position of the then-ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was recently confirmed.
The investigation of the case has thus dragged on since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the agency", admitted a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three other facilities to be key to progress in the matter, which are said to be "in functional contact" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it, still exist.
The auditors have not yet disclosed what devices are involved, what their function is, or why they are suspect.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these objects and found on satellite imagery a complex of buildings that is likely to be one of the suspected objects.
It is apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason Syria refuses IAEA access to these three sites.
It was reported in Vienna that the Syrians feared the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has documentation, including satellite imagery, that material was transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one should be set up "in connection with the production of fuel".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", that is, of uranium enrichment and reprocessing, processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium comes from and where it is supposed to split plutonium into a bomb, these central questions are only a guess.
It is also not known whether debris that could hide important clues is stored at these three sites.
It's like hundreds of truckloads have disappeared from the face of the earth, and no one seems to have any idea where the stuff went.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, just a few kilometers from el-Kibar and across the Euphrates, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable storage site for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in one analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria did ground work at all the suspected sites and removed the large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicions.
Moreover, diplomatic circles report that the IAEA spent many months developing a plan for auditors to allow Syria to keep any possible military secrets - only this effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damascus, meanwhile, has rejected this proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and that's why the thing wasn't burning, for several months now, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, one of the toughest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspection, has already spoken of "future possibilities I'm looking at", but is hesitant.
This choice carries a great risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA's Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented have no clear interest in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on her yet-to-be-named directorial debut this summer, there have been problems.
She wrote the script herself, and it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is unknown - but that too is a cause for concern.
There's a persistent rumor that this woman, who is Muslim, fell in love with a Serb man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has meanwhile been completed in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's Organization for War Victims wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and asked to meet with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper reported - Jolie is also an ambassador for the UN refugee agency.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet the women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the rape camps, there were no love stories, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organisation has therefore recommended to the UN Refugee Agency that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had her script read, allowed the filming to take place in Sarajevo after minor delays - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author emphasizes that she has no political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
It remains uncertain as to its content.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds really different: the lovers knew each other before the war started and meet again when she is dressed as a Bosnian Muslim woman in a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which sounds really different than "rape victim falls in love with her tormentor".
The fact that Jolie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie contends that the pressure is being exerted on her that is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now Hollywood hackers can free her by illegally posting her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Just out of here
Tonight is good for the Irish once again.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans screaming for joy at the sound of loud music, feet up.
The Bailey Pub in Cork, South Ireland, is heating up because players throw tennis balls three metres into beer mugs and they hit each other.
"Beer Pong" is called bizarre theater and you can win 500 euros as the winning prize and a ticket to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and the restrained computer scientist, it doesn't really go together.
Yet, the 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to distract himself from the weighty question of what the future holds.
His plan isn't a gambling spree in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand in January for an interview.
"I feel so weird about it", she says.
"It's so far away, and I don't have a job there yet".
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she's got her dream job as an Event Manager right away, maybe it's a good sign", the young man says, smiling.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of the three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin is now an IT consultant in London.
Like the Tanners, it seems to be the case with many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, predict experts at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
They're counting up to 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For a small country of only 4.5 million people, it's a major loss.
If the forecasts are correct, there will be a wave of emigration similar to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980's.
After decades of prosperity, the Irish are once again experiencing a wave of discontent.
The economic crisis is particularly affecting young, educated Irish people, who have so far seen only the upswing.
Job losses and social degradation seemed absurd in those boom years.
We needed everyone, there was money to spare.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has many letters from readers complaining: "Everything in Ireland is going downhill".
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, they're going away and our country is losing a whole generation".
"Please turn off the last one".
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees the future in black because she says the government is just lying and doesn't offer young people any prospects for the future.
"They're cutting the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy to create jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates move from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest worry is that she's gonna have to move out on her own in four years.
"The thought is sad and depressing".
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the positive side of things.
McLarnon is hosting the "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
"For newcomers to the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps in a career", says the manager.
His website has photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley, it's freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something else for six months.
Having no job in Ireland, the 29-year-old engineer is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he's going to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home, working extra shifts to pay off the mortgage at home.
"It's a little crazy sometimes", he says, crossing the threshold of his own home for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not actually in".
He laughs embarrassedly and walks through cold rooms.
The small house is in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, large expensive cars parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was no question", he says.
Is he worried about the loan going bad?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours out a hot tea, and says, "I have no children to feed, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer doesn't like the whining he hears so often these days.
"No one needs to go hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island", he says.
"A little work abroad is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish".
He laughs and then tells about his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and life in Ireland was going on, quite simply".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep the future open and just wait for life to unfold elsewhere.
He's also had a few years' work in London, and why shouldn't New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there's one more thing that's been troubling him these days: his 27th birthday celebration on Friday in Dublin.
She's worried she might crash the prom.
"No emotion at all", he says, and he drinks a whole beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing".
"Let's call it a going away party, just plain, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
Common practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of a recent Latinobarometer survey of 18 countries, published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
In this year's survey, which was conducted in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America is a pretty cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific Rim in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are Democratic-minded, which is lower than the regional average (see Graph 2).
Some 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but a large increase compared with 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they trusted the parliament in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
The support was given during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries had suffered only a brief recession and were enjoying a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies across a wide range of countries (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since surveys were started, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31 percent say that they or a close relative was a victim of crime last year, down from 38 percent last year and the lowest since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private enterprise there), even though their leftist president Hugo Chávez is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the field, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9% unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections criticised
No one expected the Haitian general election on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help a stricken country to fear.
The election meant filling ballot boxes and repeated voting, ballots scattered across the canals, voting booths broken and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed candidates, have been shouting that it's a fraud and calling for the election to be called off.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, stated that "in many respects it was a fairly good choice".
Observers from the Organization of American and Caribbean States cautiously said that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The anticipated deciding match is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, the rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have withdrawn their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But the problem could arise if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no support among the electorate, is flagged by the electoral commission for having won a decisive battle.
With the cholera epidemic raging and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but disorganization prevented them from doing so.
About 250,000 identification cards, which are necessary for voting, were left undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so it's clear that Haitians are going to have to do it themselves.
From the tips to the center
In the weeks since she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has been enjoying public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández abandons the uncompromising ways of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And these marks are what it's all going to be based on.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued his economic policies even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drafting budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income as they pleased.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized by the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (which included faking and accusing the government of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", the president said.
The 2010 budget will now be valid for the next year, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and unionists are talking about a figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 as Argentina was ravaged by economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority over inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical agency that had taken over the official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And her officials say they want to limit the wage increase to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for Argentine agricultural exports.
But inflation has disrupted growth based on the large devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is indicating that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
Now, President Fernández is facing a settlement with the creditors of the governments, who are grouped together in the Club of Paris, to whom she owes approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that he does not have this fact under the IMF's supervision, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer price index, which would resemble the introduction to the INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to stay in politics after her term ends, with her husband no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, who are tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will be subsiding.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether or not to quietly renounce many of the views her husband held in politics.
Half-incentive for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother overseas?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, voted for the mayor and city council in five city districts on November 27, which can be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the sentiments that prevail on the mainland and have a strong stake in business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, in the biggest adjustment to relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favours greater independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of the vote against 45% for the KMT.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since being elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was in the city councils together with the KMT.
The election was held like most Taiwanese elections, which involve noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags and sparingly dressed girls.
It even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for the KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien in the face, wounding him and killing the spectator.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, and the suspicions fall on the DPP, leading voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself was left in the background.
Instead, the candidates have been raving about plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
The KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the Beijing government.
But this time the DPP also gave up on inciting anti-Chinese sentiments.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, has confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue its commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They'd like to see political integration, too, but no more.
It's best to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP party has discovered itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was in a bad place: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and supporter of clear independence.
But under Ms. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has emerged that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was touted as a DPP presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their side is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes to serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can proceed without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems upset about this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the opinion that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be fighting for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the skyrocketing rate of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His dislike seems to be based primarily on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
The strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan in establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to prominent publicist Antonia Chiang, "the point of no return has passed".
Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The performance is at the request of the president and people must legally notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is being touted as one of the surprises at this year's Grammy Awards with a nomination for Best New Artist.
As Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a bit late, but it is in line with the Grammy rules that an artist may not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established".
Her 2010 ambitious album Chamber Music Society certainly marked a step forward, and with her carefree vocal style and nimble hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as the success Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters looking for similar jazz work in that category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy judges rightly award the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride from an album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of veteran saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Sympathy".
Shorty's trombone, a New Orleans favorite and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise biased toward albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's wildly steampunk-savvy Secret Society received some well-deserved recognition in the big band category, with the competition being the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still-bold Dave Holland, whose live album with the "Pathways" octave set a beautiful example of how a bassist can have his hand free as a bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead the way in the classical music category
The classical music nominations at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards are a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a score of five, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto are also up for an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The classical music producer of the year category has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for classical album were received by Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaij Saariah and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for a Grammy for contemporary works are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
The approximately 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and the "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performance by a soloist with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who was performing with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, has received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for his conducting of the Chicago Symphony in the recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nomination are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only women were nominated for the soloist position, including Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical transition category, soprano Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Planned mosque in Temecula gets approval from planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked the project as promoting terrorism and leading to a suspension of trade.
However, the jury ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complies with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, you'll remember", Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of that as an American citizen".
"It means justice always wins".
"The opposition is minimal", he added.
"Those who oppose it only scream loudly".
"We have some really great people in our valley".
The talks began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time was spent in discussions with people who were for or against the center, and the votes were evenly split, Press-Enterprise reports.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", one comment appeared.
"We're the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty embedded in the sand".
"America has fallen".
The planned Islamic Center has also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that occurred on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had been in trouble in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger, more convenient space than the storage space he was renting with a filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque, which will be 24,943 square feet in size and in the Mediterranean style of architecture, will also have two minarets and will rise to 43 feet in height.
It's supposed to occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, approximately two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents of the project can still appeal to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients opens up the space for the search for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it's a sign that life has possibilities that are beyond the main elements that have been considered basic.
"This organism has a dual ability".
"It can grow either from phosphorus or arsenic".
"This is very strange, but it is not proof of any form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life", commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appeared in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
For a long time, six basic elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur - were considered essential for life.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"You'll be amazed at what's still possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report of this discovery released to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the find, has caused widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to utilize other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life", explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", added Cockell.
It wasn't a fluke.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar, so she thought that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to replace one with the other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus".
"The result is that organisms have a very difficult time separating these elements".
"But arsenic is so different that it doesn't work like phosphorus, and once it gets into the body, it starts to work in biochemical processes", Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better under the influence of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, there is a greater chance that a form of life that uses arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but no such example has ever been found.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel have been found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akitas and a large pembrokes corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were staying in at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were found Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape".
"They were handed over to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share any details regarding their find.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
"We don't want to talk about it", said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, have not been reached to comment on the case.
They were overjoyed when their two Akitas were found at the Downey shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akita Trace, 3-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old mare Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Pembroke Rickard and Peek Welsh Corgi, who were scheduled to compete in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to compete in the AKC/Eucanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they plan to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in further competitions planned in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on the couple's nearly month-long dog show trip.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often stay in motels and park their car outside their room.
They also took three dogs - a Boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany Hound - to stay with them in a motel room.
The Akita and the Pembroke Welsh Corgis left in the car where it should have been cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit to get the dogs some fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the missing dogs.
It was unclear whether the awards would be given on Thursday.
The lion's ready to roar again now that MGM's restructuring has been given final approval by the court.
After 18 months of upheaval and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York City on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and television shows.
With Thursday's finding that the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy rules, MGM remains free of legal barriers to re-launching Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the principal executives of the downsized studio.
The number of employees will be reduced to approximately 320 from the original 400.
MGM will not emerge abruptly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources to allow a loan of $500 million to finance MGM's new operations and production.
Now it's a tie-up with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own, and the funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the firm began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management on how to resolve its finances, as the management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million per year.
That August, chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and turnover expert known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none were willing to pay the $2 billion plus the financing demanded by the creditors.
By spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board, and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan, and after months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of business in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which charge 375,000 dollars a month for their services, which control the company's operations, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee", of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has only released one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They're also planning to co-finance two films featuring the book "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its stake in these two films to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, was looking at a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technology toys to keep your gift budget in balance
This year's top contender is the most amazing iPad, followed by the video game system, but in both cases, it's a significant blow to the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and one Kinect game is the same as 10 coral swings or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy stores -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club -- and looked to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law worked; this year's technology toys have far more energy, at the same price, if not a little bit lower, than in previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys have appeared with affiliated websites, the two most well-known toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, since age 3) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
One squeeze will give the animal a tone, and the second squeeze will start to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey.
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live Technology that can play Simon Says and also walk the moon with its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
The children test the dance instructor's Mickey toy, though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, with a bag full of quiz cards, designed to turn a drive into a fun job with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you're sending for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest variant with easy-to-use, qwerty keyboard, although the games are not as effective teaching as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12 years old), the first major change to the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for children ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to install games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for kids 8 and up) is a set of five cubes that are not as big as a matchbox, each one with a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before time runs out; it's great for competing in improvised word-making.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
The two most widely represented toys in the toy trade were Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough Club Penguin store credits for any two items.
That could include roller skates or Puffle.
Slightly larger than the size of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and up), the latest in a line of microbots powered by button batteries.
The beetle moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun to make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find his way out.
It's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
The introduction of more delicate police controls in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlled his orders, and issued orders verbatim with military authority.
He wanted the female members - Chinese city-level law-enforcement officials feared and despised for their tough-guy ways and penchant for violence - to make a certain impression on the crowd.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, he whispers softly, "how pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood in the spotlight.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged according to the rule.
Four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look average", said Mr. Tang defiantly.
"The models are nice".
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city watchers in China.
One city has mandated that new gatekeepers have a college education.
Guangdong Province has changed the grey-green uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the staring eyes with powerful weapons: in 2009, one report reported that 50 officers were relentlessly surrounding a food cart, staring at the owner until the doorman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its city police force, who have been selected specifically for their appearance, fitness and young age.
The aim is to show the police not only the rough side but also the more subtle, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into the Chinese secret city groups.
They'd argue with critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in Hubei Province stabbed an uninvolved viewer to death after he used his mobile phone to film what they were doing during an intervention in a landfill protest.
Last year, there was a training exercise for police in Beijing, and the training manual was stolen and posted on the Internet, and the manual included a description of how to effectively beat off offenders without a trace of blood.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
One violent video game, available for download, shows Chinese police officers attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan has frightened the government", China Daily, the national publication, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
The paper said "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics say that's not enough.
After the district announced interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editor for The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were just distractions.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district required female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with good build and "five facial features in the right proportion".
Adepts should be higher than average - more than 1.6 metres.
Service at 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is too psychologically demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing", said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, a government-supported website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there's the nature and the "internal qualities".
Women are like flower pots, he said, and he added, "Besides being pots, they'll have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that the requirements for a college degree are common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is a hot topic among the Chinese.
Disability or maiming certainly does not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or a backed-up person to serve us", said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who is guarding Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with an apple-like face and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her looks could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her partner in the piece, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city".
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are bigger than just chasing merchants into the alleys where they can carry out their business.
Each morning the group faces more than ten vendors who run on foot or on bicycles, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are evicted.
"Mr. Wang, you need to leave".
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the salesman began to run, and in time left his wheel with the noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"Every day is basically the same thing", said Huang Jing, 20, a freelance marketing student.
"The great routine"
One reason is that female police officers do not have the same powers as their male counterparts to seize merchandise from dealers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male superiors.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, protested after false rumors spread that police had killed the vendors.
More than ten police officers or policemen were injured during the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Police have seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry all he wanted.
15 minutes away from the cops, face-to-face, elbows against the vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40, who now only have a supporting role.
Unlike them, they're not trained in image maintenance and enhancement.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"It's usually the public that starts it".
The D.A.s are not gonna charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure lobbying, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for president in 2012.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was "very pleased" with the decision that followed the nearly year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the subject of an investigation and that it has no plans to bring any further charges against him in this matter".
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there was strong evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobbying effort that was to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as the treasurer for the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, so much so that they cite documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was, until recently, Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was legally barred from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual handling of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to violate the lobbying ban.
The evidence that has been released "shows that this is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department is cautious about political prosecutions after a string of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens amid accusations of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their guns", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the advocacy group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically shows that the laws don't apply to high-ranking government officials", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he was called by the Attorney General's Office on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the Department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable describing the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint filed by an ethics group alleging that the Ensign parents' $96,000 payment to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job for was NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator.
One December 2008 email showed that after Mr. Hampton began lobbying the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him he was "drilling" at the Home Office on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and urged the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first emerged last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a statement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow up with the Justice Department and close the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", she continued.
Cheshire Council appeals on Twitter
There were half a dozen of them in the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they were sending out news of the horrific testimony on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that over 140,000 tweets were about the rape and child bed-wetting in the house that was set on fire.
Thursday was the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, citizens, and the family, and was to be officially terminated with the imposition of the death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal with pleadings and arguments that would likely occupy the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the trial - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere", and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then led the jury to decide in terms of influencing public opinion.
This argument might lead the judge to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules should also be required in the courtroom.
"From my experience in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technology into the courtroom affects the right to a fair trial for individuals", said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' lead attorney.
In that case, Justice Jon C. Blue of the State Supreme Court briefly rejected the allegations regarding last week's verdict, saying that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the final word on this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting on high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in its decision it said that in Sheppard v. Maxwell, the trial was "carnival atmosphere" for the sake of the media.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts reviewing Hayes's ruling half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to govern the way communications are made from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" on the highly-watched cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting direct communication to the courtroom could make the process fairer.
Twitter's case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes' lawyers who would have argued for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
The defense also argues, for example, that in Mr. Hayes' case, there may have been bias when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them images of the crime that would terrify the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defense also contends that they reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argues that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury who was critical of the prosecutors, and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to reflect on the weekend.
The jury was not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the trial may attract the most interest.
They stated in their objection to the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the campaign for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media had been constantly fanning the flames of emotion about this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in front of the courthouse", wrote the lawyer, "was something not seen here in New Haven before, and perhaps a national rarity".
Their focus on Twitter's influence is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports reported later and that in their view the judicial police should control the scope of further prosecutions.
But some lawyers have called for appeals courts, with the often-used argument that social and technological change requires court adjustments.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing that right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in the case of Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process, and they wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, there was little courtesy this week in Washington.
Is this the first patchwork of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan fighting in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and House leaders yielded no major findings on the key issues that must be discussed during the session.
But in any case, it was a polite discussion of the two parties' differences of opinion, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party politics.
Wednesday's public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civil, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close cooperation over several months has built up a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gulf that still divides the members.
And it's hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in a testing period, probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation by the participants was also carried out with minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too broad and too deep to suggest a quick change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it's a matter of taxes, spending, health care or rights, the two sides are miles apart.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed", said Pete Wehner, the Bush administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up the party's emotions and then they shut up.
It's good".
On a number of issues, especially those to be discussed in the House, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are over at the end of the year, and nobody's looking at it favorably.
Both parties want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits just because Republicans can't watch them support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployed people unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already a growing optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new landmark treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on critical issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it's a probable period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term returns to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is widespread to a large extent - that politeness would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I look at everything that happens between now and 2012 as a shadow box, with the main events happening in 2012", he said.
The reasons are largely related to the assembling of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing they must live up to their promises and cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These supportive lines are clear in initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Joint Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they are, in their view, to bring the deficit issue to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial matters, we have, at least today, little basis or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battle between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of partisan conflicts, with Republicans challenging Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of more partisan cooperation.
What will cause the shift?
The public opinion.
There's plenty of evidence that despite the partisanship in the last election, most Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If it could be headed for a dead end, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public reaction very carefully.
Anyone who threatens to lose votes will likely change course and seek compromise.
That may be an optimistic view of things.
The bias and bias is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it shows that there's a bigger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than there was between the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important elections in 2012.
Based on that reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would be welcome by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document depicts Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city is run by a "kleptocracy" that continues to receive bribes and protection payments on its way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a February filing.
The police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings, which help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They're taking money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the office" - will take its toll as money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was released Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The recording was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share in corruption.
It was revoked in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption charges for many years, and have won several false charges for such allegations.
In September, when he was questioned on a Russian TV station about proven corruption testimony, he said: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's crap".
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up in the ballot.
It is unusual, however, to find such details expressed in this way in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The Moscow city government and its links to criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' confirming that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government", says the report.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world".
"Luzhkov is at the very top".
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and militia are in second place".
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors".
"It's an inefficient system where criminal groups fill vacancies in certain areas because the city doesn't provide certain services".
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "Moscovo business owners realize that it is better to seek protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), since they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on the agenda".
The record says that while withdrawing money is complex, the protection itself can be difficult; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their shops are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report says men are taking suitcases, possibly laden with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of the political class because there are no political classes in Russia anymore".
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm among the Russian government, although only to the extent that it can be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue for a solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN's Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks released may have been fakes, and he reacted angrily to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Robin Hood.
"The truth of the matter is that it's about our cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical".
Khmer Rouge veterans are forced to face the past
In a brightly lit concrete classroom with dirty and scratched walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Ta Moka".
"He was a good leader and cared for his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge regime, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered, a long-standing loyalty is also being broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims were allowed to confront people who were part of the regime in public at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children for the first time.
And in July, the UN and a Cambodian court jointly lifted the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng violent group, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest among the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng grew, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is anger and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"It divides families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian-Thai border.
There they started an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ran guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have been reduced to ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them have nostalgic memories of the time of the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government positions in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people have had minimal benefit from the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They were raised without any idea of conducting business".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"The Mock fed them all".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of everything ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the executives and people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will proceed with the four cases.
It was not enough to calm the anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a steamy evening recently, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If she was subpoenaed, she wouldn't go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are any more criminal prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would ensue if the court sought additional suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer relations means blinding the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other".
The Centre has published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages long and titled 'The History of Democratic Cambodia'.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Vale Touchak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took home the book for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more difficult and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the courts are starting to make an impact, he added.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong spell here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path lined with weeds and littered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a resin-plated roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone saleswoman said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him", she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to withdraw its stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after the Security Summit of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to hit a rock bottom last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, several covert operations have been conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about £500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement turned out to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good move to get the former Soviet Republics invited to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place for the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves that the process is working", said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium stockpiles.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... We're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're only using it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was conducted by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply a Belarusian research institute with low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
"Everything was very carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of trust", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, the Department of Energy's official for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Nonproliferation estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
According to the Joint Declaration, Belarus will endeavour to remove its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"Welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that a more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the foundation for improving relations between the two countries and is essential for the progress of the country and its people", he said.
The Spanish government didn't make any money off the CIA flights.
The Spanish government has not made any concessions regarding the CIA flights transporting captured Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guantanamo Bay through Spanish territory, as expressed in a cable by the United States Ambassador in Madrid.
This is according to documents provided by the Wikileaks server of the newspaper El País, which also states that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may show that it has adequate oversight over foreign aircraft flying over Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "has taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide on the issue.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights through its territory.
"They just want to be informed", so as not to be "caught unprepared", Aguirre says in one of the documents.
Also, then-Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to keep the matter as low-key as possible, but with the matter in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating material or any sensitive information", the embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern more about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the declassification of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch with the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the Ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit", he had already instructed his collaborators "to avoid elaborate comments in order to reduce tensions".
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the behaviour of the Partido Popular (PP) political party in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government", he notes.
A confessed mother-killer complained online about maternal "worries"
A young woman was talking about the baby when it was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galician".
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She has been using this nickname since she was a child, communicating with her cousin and at least one of her friends, both from the village of Noia in the region of La Coruña, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know the wife's emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunes in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
Soon she had a new friend.
Her choice was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Cesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palma for a week.
But from the content of her communication, it's clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she's alone in Menorca and she writes, "Alberto is kind of mad that I left for work".
"When I told him, he seemed fine, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and can't do what he wants".
Then she talks about the text message she just got: "I want you back this month or give me the address where I can send the baby to you".
"If he doesn't like it", she complains, "I'll take the baby when I get back".
In May, she talks about returning to her place of residence: "I'm going this week, but I'm only staying until the 19th, because I have to go on the 20th for work so I don't lose the job".
He explains that if all goes well, he'll take his son with him.
"He'll be with whoever he's supposed to be with, which is me, and I'll never leave him with anyone but my mother again in my life", a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There's another entry in July.
When he types this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is pleased on one hand, but not on the other".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he's quite happy here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day".
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to summer school there, so I'll save some money for a nanny".
17th, greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come".
"Alberto says he's e-mailed you some video, watch whatever he wants, meet me, have sex".
The 30th, another report: "The boy is doing well, he's going to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner: "He gives me money".
Monica's blog posts on anime and manga are all over the internet.
She even had her own MySpace page, now revised, where she called herself "Muki Ex-Prisoner".
"Terror by the Galician motto".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and guilt.
She doesn't want to believe that all this happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Provincial Chapel in Palma yesterday, where she came from the detention center in Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant had no memory of what happened and "did not intend to harm the child in any way".
But before that, she confessed to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a trunk.
The defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the Chamber and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP could have the keynote at the municipal councils in Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes and experienced MPs in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has a vision of the general election, whether or not there will be an increase, and its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually one compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalans won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 elections, the number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, continues, the party's analysts have calculated that if general elections are held, the PPC could gain 12 seats in the House of Commons against the current 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió, in Czech, Shoda a unie - ed.) would also gain 4 seats (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of vital importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the population, the ERC would lose one MEP - now 3 - while the ICV would retain one seat, or win another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next delivery will be in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist domination in the four main provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest budget projected - €661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree on the possibility that the PSC could lose city councils in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the Socialists would not retain a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona legislature - as it needs to win at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its vote count in four capital cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party under the current mayor, José Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only won 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marián Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The population also increased in other important towns such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
A Catalan cell has provided thousands of passports to al-Qaeda.
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian detained by the General Information Office in Barcelona were part of a Thai-led jihadist cell that provided passports to various Al-Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the latter of which was responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" weakens the Al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "thus limits its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, it could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaeda organization so that their "warriors" could travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units were involved in these investigations, and it cannot be ruled out that similar interventions like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night will not take place in other European countries in the coming days.
In connection with this operation (which captured the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another operation was developed in Thailand, which captured the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikan Kilayajbumrung.
It was these same men who ran a cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the demands of the Islamists.
That means the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, they had to be valid for several years and they had to be unmarked visas.
The investigation documents emphasize that no facts are known to link the Catalan detainees to the Mumbai bombing, although the perpetrator of these attacks, Lashkar-e-Taiba, was said to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
It is worth noting, however, that a few days before this attack, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a wire agency, which were "put" into the purchase of mobile phone cards, which were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands that Mas stop the fiscal deal
The PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) president, Alicia Sánchezová-Camachová, had the opportunity yesterday to present personally to Artur Massa her conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are similar to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and to abandon risky ventures such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wants to propose during his mandate.
The Catalan People's Party leader arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the assurance of the 18 seats she won in last Sunday's elections, a figure more than sufficient to win her support, so the CiU candidate needs at least one opposition party to abstain from voting for him.
The future alliance that the nationalists would like to keep in the House when the general elections are held depends on the possible agreement with the PP, but so far the talks he is holding with the rest of the political leaders in these days are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, to get her support for taking office, "she will have to end all sovereign and liberationist talk", as well as an economic deal - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to narrow the political apparatus of the overwhelmed self-government and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's inauguration will be discussed by the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
He has already met Joaquín Nadal (PSC), who has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths were not due to "lack of precautions".
The Olot Center's performance doesn't rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage done to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joano Villa Dilmé, a carer who, while employed there, killed at least 11 seniors in his care.
The director of the home for the elderly, Joan Sala, arrived accompanied by the facility's lawyer, Joan Canady, and announced that "by the wish of La Caritat, charges could be brought against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "legitimacy and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the appropriate authorities".
In addition to the damage to the institution's reputation that may result from its failure to disclose the caregiver's criminal activities in a timely manner, the demands for material compensation, which are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the deceased, are a major threat to La Caritat.
Joan Vila Dilmé has admitted that his first crime was committed back in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then
The judge ordered the exhumation of the bodies of eight clients of the nursing home, suspecting that in many cases the deceased had not been examined by a physician in person but that, because of the age and poor health of the patients, the procedure was done by telephone.
Yesterday, through its director, La Caritat strongly rejected this extreme and stressed that "lack of action could in no way be the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party other than the defendant himself committed any error".
The man now nicknamed "The Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday, specifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later, he killed the second old lady.
In this case, he caused death by administering too much insulin, unlike the first time he used a combination of sedatives.
The director of La Caritat said that it is complicated to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably the means this caregiver used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve their suffering in six of the nine cases.
However, it is only now that the analysis, which is now underway in the laboratory, should reveal whether Vila was lying and was really looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by administering a blow to the head, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe in medical claims nor does it rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he admitted, and justifies his behavior in various versions that Vila has presented to the court, knowing that he must change his behavior when it is revealed that he killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to a threat from the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal differentials closed strongly and European bank shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market which, although it is declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It's gonna take a while for the investor to lose his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank summoned us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested that the State debt repurchase plan for inefficiency be terminated and all emergency liquidity measures eliminated within a time limit and that unrestricted access be maintained for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast liquidity levels 'at least until March' and to hold a three-month auction with unlimited access until the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying program and even announce an intensification of it.
If they fail to meet the expectations created, they will create a market reaction of yesterday, and if they continue to blindly pull the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the May convention, where they said they weren't even thinking about buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and durable.
In May, the armored fist announced on Monday and on Wednesday it said it had already bought many, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's auction for a year's exchange in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
This resulted in a 30 point drop in rates in Portugal, reflecting the change in market sentiment that followed Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures have been published representing losses by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts are about 10 billion in short-term securities and another 15 thousand potential, by February, they have a chance to become private capital, or else they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after failing to detect the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the relief plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get a new budget approved by parliament and still does not have enough support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has toned down her speech to ease the tension in the face of the next EU summit on 14 December, which will require a political compromise that shows that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the rest would rather play Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - to investors, this sounds like the Four Years of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet-Zapater effect explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose by 4.5%, twice as much as the other European stock exchanges.
In contrast to February, the government and the Spanish National Bank reacted quickly and convincingly - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
We have a key three-year bond auction here today that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will create a strong demand that will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
To ask for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash we don't need -- there's $40 billion in cash at El Tesoro, three times what we had in March -- and high rates and access to markets would close us down.
However, the strategy of the Caesar woman must continue to be used - "not only be it, but also dream it".
We can do this.
The President of the Eulen Group challenges the Vega Sicilia negotiations requested by his children
The storm of open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not going away.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, is challenging, after what he perceives as "completely irrelevant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro scheduled for the 16th of this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, at which they should try to enforce their majority and seize with the help of the administrative authorities of the prosecution of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are finishing up the legal team for a new chapter in their dispute over control of a piece of the company.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to ease into his dispute over membership of the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed as directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, have been removed from its administrative committee.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has renewed the thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Until the dispute is settled, the appeal to the judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of the commission.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriza, David Álvarez considers as "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial cunning and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which was completely invalid".
This argumentation will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this action as 'completely irrelevant'.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the court convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group which owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the group claims, according to the family protocols, the right to use 51% of the capital.
This is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when he reviews the challenge to the proceedings.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been one of surprise and success.
At first, no one took the prospects of this new team very seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without wanting to diminish the riding abilities of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful ride-simulation software that a German company launched in 2007 for the purpose of long-distance motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software tool, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants, and for high-precision machines.
The aim is to reproduce the product or to simulate the process faithfully before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expense.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that using this software device, the Red Bull team was able to make "in a matter of hours, in near real time", modifications and improvements that would otherwise be detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians, who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly skilled young professionals equipped with powerful IT technology, who analyse and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing cars with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Modifications to materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation on this technical capability is the amount of $40 million, which is the maximum that each Formula One team can spend in each season to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech factory about 30 miles outside London to design and build its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are off limits to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered "a great secret".
The list of participants in this project is 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull in Formula One is undoubtedly the new champion Sebastian Vettel.
But behind the immense technological resources the energy drink brand has invested in its participation in the racetrack, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, yet unknown.
Steve Nevey, chief technology officer, says that five years ago, you could say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to 50 percent of the victory, and the rest was due to the riders.
Today, that ratio has changed and technology accounts for 85% of the successes, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores in cooperation with local distributors over two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrer, Vice-President of HP Spain, cited as an example the newly rebuilt Gran Vía store in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 points of sale in Europe by 2013, including 20 shops in Spain.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest, Romania, and Belgrade, Serbia, with the third in Barcelona.
Herrer declined to say where additional stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrer, who also runs HP's human resources systems, ensured that the philosophy of opening stores would remain the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company is advising on an exclusive design of shop equipment (with products that can be tested interactively) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in the provision of staff for the shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aimed to 'improve customer service, services to SMEs in purchasing, service, after-sales service and even packaging'.
The Barcelona sale is part of a pioneering pilot programme at world level to address any problems with the warranty's computer equipment.
The online service is linked to a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We can solve problems in 10 minutes that could take up to two days".
'This system is specifically designed for SMEs and ordinary customers, as large firms already have a contracted technical assistance service,' Helena Herrer stressed yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on stealing a million clients from its competitors in three years.
More optimistic than other bosses, the deputy board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it is expected to reduce interest rates, which will be compensated by lower bank charges and lower credit prices.
Sabadell expects to have a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, but also to gain market share by attracting one million new private clients - or 700,000, if we exclude those who might leave the bank - since the institution has hitherto been more interested in SMEs and large enterprises than in small clients.
The Bank has already attracted 250,000 private clients and 50,000 business clients this year.
Its market share is 3,5% for private customers, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
The Commission notes that the Bank's financial performance is not reflected in the Bank's performance in the financial year 2011-2013.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set targets and make them public, since the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, which was set up four years ago, although it was initially for three years, but the market situation required an extension for a further period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be long".
In addition, in two or three years' time, "it will be very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the risk premium price that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to get liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, compensating for the decline in margins.
'The liquidity and financing issue is structural and will be a stressor for lending.'
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto had already issued orders to its networks on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now to reduce commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The strategic plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not exclude corporate operations.
He assures us that in Spain "more sizes will be required".
"There will be no stone on the stone next year", he assured.
It confirms that capital requirements are 'very low' and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will be among the red numbers.
And it shows that the FROB can supplement the fundraising on the market before a new capital measure.
After the assurance that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, it is possible to receive short-term financing through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of mergers
The Director-General of the CECA rejected yesterday the idea of another wave of mergers in the savings sector and again insisted on the speed with which the sector was being reorganised.
When the process of associating Spanish savings banks started, several institutions had assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a new wave of such operations would emerge.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are the conventions".
"Most of them are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter", the Director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA (Aragon's Association of Directors and Executive Officers), Olavarrieta described the process of concentration as taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as is shown by the instalments that have appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank in the past, not now", he stressed.
'The move from 45 savings banks with an average assets of 28,000 million to 17,000,000,000 is a process that has no precedent in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty', he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of unfortunate opinions about the slow pace of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on schedule before the end of the year".
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain had the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "lack of knowledge" to those who questioned this.
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and the system, which has managed a "very important" process of concentration and is proceeding at "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking had performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but it set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Tensions in the markets provoked a two-pronged government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from a reduction in taxes for SMEs, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies and the abolition of the 426 euros for unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Management), the managers of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgadova, supported by former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in triggering the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is the next step in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which contradicts the idea of keeping old traditions that is held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while the southern countries would leave the currency area.
The second is a return to the march - although it may seem like sci-fi now, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, fiscal austerity, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals for some of them, and an extension of the possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for slander now.
First, after the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of the contradiction between what Germany considered to be the right course (fiscal austerity and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The other was shown by these Central European countries, as Merkel painfully delayed the decision to rescue Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has again come out with a clear position when she demanded that the European Union conventions be reformed to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time to make it mandatory for private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it hastened the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved and we should be following the Union's reform process over the coming months, which should enable these measures to be taken from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And he tells us all that although measures are now needed, which he apparently disagrees with, the old euro will be finished by this date.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new currency area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare a deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we must take a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
The alternative, based on debt and building, with the huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed during the boom years of Spain, is simply not going to be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand that.
It is not just a matter of restoring the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we could be wrong.
I hope these current turbulences will be replaced by a more calm atmosphere.
And that we will take the opportunity they give us until the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his double declaration (reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the idea that things need to be fixed has been opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of less serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that they warned us.
Sport and circumvention
The finches Alonso and Ramos showed against Ajax show ingenuity, not the intention to escape punishment.
The allegedly fabricated expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramose) from the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November has caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether, eventually, UEFA should not punish both players.
It is well known that a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won), the players named one by one deliberately lost time at the time of the foul to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in the top of their group - and will be able to proceed to the next stage, stripped of their cards.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary committee gave coach José Mourinho a two-match ban and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos of football, the rules that are not written, but they're followed.
Part of the debate in this case has been the participation of Real Madrid (which boasts of its generosity and honour in its anthem and has already fined its players for similar acts), and apparently also the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
In any event, the debate is whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts are circumventing the law; they are indeed acts which respect the rules of sport, the meaning of which, of course, it seems to be trying to circumvent.
The damage to the sporting spirit is being dealt with.
One of the requirements of sporting conduct is the physical inviolability of the opponents, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. no violent play took place.
Another of the characteristics of a clean game is to avoid that players have an advantage over the opposing team by their offence - which has not happened here either.
So the paradox of the Real Madrid players' actions is that there was no what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumvention of the law, no hidden violation of the rules to avoid punishment, but rather this behavior was to be as visible as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
Another question, though, is what benefit will be gained by the guilty ones from their willful transgression.
It is important to note that the opponent is not at a disadvantage and that there is no advantage in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The obvious advantage is that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage in the long run and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team may be eliminated, and besides this action, the players will reimburse the penalty and go to the second round of cards, where one card less than in the first round is enough to eliminate.
So as the rounds continue, it's not entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations are not against the spirit of sport, which is to make strategic decisions that allow for maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we are discussing, the players did not aim to avoid a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running from it.
While the line between common sense and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly common sense.
I think the controversy stems from two things: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way the instructions were passed to provoke them from the leadership.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
The bidding war for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictates that this year's avalanche of reservations will be on December 16th and 17th.
There are increasingly more celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or the lottery, the arrival of December brings back the pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but which have been reduced by the crisis to a fight to win customers by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, according to the businessmen and associations in the sector surveyed.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) concentrated requests for the week from December 13, creating an avalanche of reservations for the peak days (16 and 17), while the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, many companies have cancelled group parties for budgetary reasons.
To keep up with the tradition, many employees pay for parties out of their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices that are too high, says Gaieta Farras, president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona.
The restaurant's representative is hesitant to predict the festivities this month.
"People think twice before making reservations".
"They want to go out, but they're cautious about the price", he adds.
Shops will do well "by offering quality and good service at a favourable price", he says, recalling that the crisis has led to a downward trend in customers, with most customers now willing to spend around €25.
A survey of the various facilities shows that the largest surge in reservations is on the evening of December 17th.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most requests being for spending up to 30 euros, which they have adapted to the menus offered, whose total prices are between 25 and 30 euros.
In another important company, Andilana, which has 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible and impossible to keep up with last year's prices, and our menus, which are for everyone to choose from, range from 19.95 to 30 euros", they report.
The AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remain optimistic after recording an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources from the company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be a pre-Christmas celebration among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of €30 or more, as they noticed a trend of guests spending 10% more compared to last year in exchange for other items such as cava.
They also noted that companies are already appearing to recall their employees, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Enric Goma, vice-president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Centre Association), believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients are "dealing to the max".
This impression has not diminished during the Christmas season, whoever pays, he points out.
Pakistan 's nuclear program has caused great unrest in the United States .
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that is being stirred up in Washington over Pakistan's nuclear program.
Besides providing clarifying and meaningful details about the content of the communications and the thoughts of the North American diplomats in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two states on nuclear security is "on the decline" rather than increasing, and that this unstable Asian country is producing "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled but are stored in pieces to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what Ambassador Anne W. Patterson to Pakistan calculated in a report prior to a visit by then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of nuclear materials transport".
The increased number of individuals associated with nuclear arsenals and missile programs is now being observed not only by the US but also by Russia as a widespread cause for caution.
"Pakistan has had to hire people of strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; with the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs", said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev in a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news in the documentation released by Julian Assange's server is the increasingly decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy dispatch that described communications with Pakistan as "frustrating" said: "Transparency often lacks; offers of help go unanswered or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a South Asia national intelligence officer, states that "despite economic disaster, Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons at the rate of no other country in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to make "very clear" during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani military must stop its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama is appointing a high-ranking official in charge of counterterrorism to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red alert" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be certain of the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued an "emergency call", a so-called red notice, to "locate and track the movement" of Assange.
But this is not a standard arrest warrant.
Moreover, this call is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it's not about the latest leak of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents, but about the sexual abuse charges an Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was on November 20th that the International Police Corps, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but it was not made public until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries have instructions for Interpol to identify or locate Assange "with a view to imposing temporary detention and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person who is subject to a red alert, many member states, the organisation explained, consider the so-called red notice to be an arrest - this must be ensured by the national police - especially if countries have a bilateral extradition agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
This move was angered by Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a statement claiming that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder had expressed a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who they compare to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter states.
While the world is searching for him - and his mother is defending his innocence from Australia - Assange is still in the dark, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine, in which he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If she is found to be responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations, in violation of international conventions to which the United States is a signatory, she should resign", he said.
His comments were rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has assigned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views being proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to consider listing WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization "so that anyone who financially supports or otherwise assists them can be targeted and prosecuted".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, saying that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently recanted.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use a drone or something".
The one who didn't apologise was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak, has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient", he told Fox News.
Puigcercós seeks tranquility in the ERC by "glancing" at Caro's supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuation.
Huguet proposes more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for dealing with the internal revolt in the ERC, which has already been unsuccessful, losing 11 MPs and half the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of the former leader, José Luis Carrado-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot be concerned with the same as he was with other vanished currents.
So the leader of the Left will try to win new critics by winking, which will help him to turn in the municipal elections.
Puigcercós first announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to vote in secret for him to remain in office.
With ballots, not by raising a hand.
If Carr's supporters want to pass a criminal vote to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
The boss really wants to avoid the division and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would not be a good result "after Bulgaria" either.
Carod's supporters are demanding more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture they consider of no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest body at conventions.
But since they don't have enough votes to force the resignation, they're going to try to get the executive to recall the plan between now and May.
They therefore expect to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document to be put to the vote by the management at the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for promising to move the congress as early as the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "multilingualism" is detrimental to stability and that his goal is to ensure that the organization is able to wash its laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, an article written by current adviser Josep Huguet on his blog seems to be characteristic.
After considering Puigcercós' ideology, this innovation adviser took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named five, two of them excellent.
The first is to "recompile" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means including new faces who are from the Carod-favorite sector.
The second target could be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely abandon the meeting as a functioning mechanism.
So he's fighting for a constitutional reform to allow congresses to be held through elected delegates.
The end of the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercós' team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 conciliation assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on constitutional reform.
This matter is still unresolved as the situation within the Party has deterred the resolution of this matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to re-engage with this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico has recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In Mexico, 23 people were killed in November, four fewer than the previous month, reported the newspaper MILENIO.
The murders include the cases of three women and the discovery of two separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 murders in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, the discovery of a body in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca, stands out.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a gunshot wound to the head, and was bound in a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that had been stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early Thursday morning, November 4, the co-operatives discovered a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a note signed by a criminal organization, probably La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight bullets after leaving his home to start collecting trash.
On November 7th, two victims, aged 30, were shot in the head in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, a man was found dead on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony, shot in the forehead, and a .25-caliber cartridge was found underneath his body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage drain in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue crews have conducted a thorough search for other parts of the vehicle, but they have not found them.
Tepotzotlán residents reported finding a body with hands tied behind and head wrapped at the site of the Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
In mid-month, the murder of two men was reported, who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the trunk of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district, and death threats were also found on the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz County.
In a nearby colony, the remains of a body were found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan, Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning, a man was found dead in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellowish-blue sheet, who was tentatively identified by the note the killers left with his body as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca, in the San Francisco neighborhood of Acuautla, a woman was found without signs of life with two stab wounds to her back.
The woman's skin was found to be tattooed with the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") and also bearing necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man was found dead in a car in the village of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped in tape and a note were found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victims had a message, probably from one of the criminal organizations, that said: "This is what happens to those who do not adapt".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found, with signs of torture and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi outside the Justice Center in the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl counties.
The first was cut and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with tape and had a message left with him; while the second was tortured and was found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China sticks to its greenhouse gas reduction target
The country's representative at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and made clear that it was insisting on its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, Su Wei assured that his country had made an enormous effort to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country had already invested $245 million in the past four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He referred to the four pillars of the Chinese strategy on climate change: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said progress had already been made on all these points, including the adoption last year of a new energy law, which includes proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It further underlined that in China, the federal authorities have worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
Furthermore, various multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project, the project to replace incandescent lamps with energy-efficient ones and the mitigation and adaptation project are also underway, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he pointed out, China's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are 6 tons, while in the United States it's 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
The expulsion of Espino was legalized:
The National Chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech: Národní akční strana - ed.) stated that the former Chairman of this party is entitled to claim his right to the National Order Commission.
The National Chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been legalized and that the former chairman of this party was entitled to appeal to the National Commission of Order and claim his right.
In an interview with the state governor Gabin Cué Monteagudo, before the objection, he said that the expulsion of Espino was in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Planning Commission".
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal his case to the National Council's Disciplinary Committee to make it a decision made by the competent authority", he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that he has never been at the negotiating table for the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This [the 2012 alliance] is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was a plan for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he pointed out.
The PAN president said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, but rather benefit from it and strengthen it", he added.
He said that the committee could, without debate, elect the best chairman or chairwoman that PAN deserves for another three years, so he would hand over the reins to "whoever the committee chooses".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of those five I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman".
He predicted that the party's rise in the last election in July would be reflected in future factions, although "it's not time to think about 2012 yet".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have their roots in the alliances of Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the object of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to these expectations".
When asked about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionario Institucionalista Partido, Czech: Revolucionário Partido Revolucionário Partido Revolucionário, Czech: Revolucionário Institucionalista Partido Revolucionário, Czech: Revolucionário Partido Revolucionário Partido Institucionalista: Revolucionário Partido Nacionalista: Revolucionário Partido Nacionalista: Revolucionário Partido Nacionalista: Institucionalista Party of the Republic: Revolucionista Party of the Republic: The Party of the Republic: The Party of the Republic: The Party of the Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Party for the Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The Republic: The
"If the PRI thinks that the Zedilla and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Claderon governments, then let them defend them, let them come out of their shells", he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during his speech at the National Auditorium, since there is no rubber stamp or censorship in this country.
Obama is promoting the Student Aid Bill on Twitter
"If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama, in a tweet on his personal Twitter account, joined the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students.
"If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", Obama tweeted.
His brief notes a link to a broader document asking the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on this bill approaches.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard", he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any legislation unless the expansion of the Bush-era tax cuts and funding for the government is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the voting on the Dream Act and other bills, such as ratifying a new nonproliferation treaty with Russia called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman expressed his belief that once the fiscal issue is resolved, it will be possible to draw up a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there is still time"...
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year"...
I believe we can reach agreement on this at some point and then we can plan the order of other matters", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will request a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, so a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though more likely next week.
The Senate's approval of the Dream Act, or the "American Dream" law, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, had lived in the country for the past five years, and had been accepted into institutions of higher education or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of several Republicans, so his supporters' organizations are conducting intense agitation to ensure that the bill passes.
The Democrats, who have a majority in support of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed his opposition, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
That's why the Dream Act supporters need to get a few Republicans in case more Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are negotiating the most are Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who has completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
The other Republican who supported the bill, John McCain, has yet to comment at this time.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts believe the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
literature, they put a finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is the Czech equivalent of "hit a nail on the head - see translation).
The second round of the pleasure from language cycle was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in Language, but... What's expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to launch the second round of Pleasures in Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another fair, the roundtable was devoted to Sex in Language, she explained).
"It's getting us into trouble", the Argentine writer said to a mostly young audience at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear the roundtable discussion, hosted by Marisol Schultz and featuring Valenzuel, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Monter, and Luisa García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz then described as a great story, in which Luisa is the first-person protagonist, who, in search of knowledge, what is the "wound", goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get an answer, although the trace of the same story does.
She leaves the infectious disease doctor convinced, "Patience is not my strong point, maybe it's my wound".
Finally, after frustration with the trauma specialist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who will reveal the secret: "wound represents what is really opened and the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded that "she had only learned so much about the wound, that it is really unfolded and that it does not exist", but she had become convinced that pleasure and traps in language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuela played with both.
And then there's Sergio Ramirez from Nicaragua, who came up with a lovely story called "The Glory of Invention", where the finger is not named in the wound, but in one moment it appears.
with elements of magical realism, tells the story of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or restored the dignity lost by a virgin, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning there was no shortage of his own chroniclers who told it, and here is a quote from Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration of the narrative of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the fake testimony that was presented in stories as real, but in no other way has the story of America ever been told with such imagination that it lacked even shame".
However, he stressed, "it is the fools and liars who have the most imagination", and it is precisely where reality and lies merge, where it is no longer known which of the stories belongs to one group and which to another, that fiction literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the Cervantes tradition.
"Because of his legacy, we have what we have".
Mayra Monter then highlighted and praised the variety of interpretations made possible by the invitation to the International Book Fair with her essay Finger in the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed to the great wound of social violence that is passing through her country - and shared by Latin America - as a result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which is obviously not intended", she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and mind control, that is overrun with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every push is a little no, and behind every denial there is also a little yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must colour: and colour means many times to put a finger in the wound and to harass those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without colouring, and also to harass the authorities who prefer this black and white world", he said, to promote the meaning of writing.
Romano is going for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has had good and bad times in his career, but he has already reached the decisive series on three occasions.
In addition, the two teams will face each other in a duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, with two different styles of play, with different techniques, and with different results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has had good and bad times in his career, but he has already reached the deciding series on three occasions, but until now he has gone undefeated, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team in the next final.
Santista's first final as a coach was the Apertura 2002, when he was in charge of Morelia, who lost 4-2 to Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003, he again played in the decisive match, also losing 3-1 to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, again against the "Diablos" of Toluka, Rubén suffered another defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenarios" (Deportivo Toluca - nickname of the club - see translation). After 210 minutes of play, he was undefeated 2-2, after a series of penalty shoots, he got the advantage three to one and had two chances to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed 11 steps and the team suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important institution is the one.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I am committed to, and the title would be obviously for me, but the first one is the most important", the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
In his vivid memory, he has a previous final, in which, he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee writes the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, and so must the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to celebrate, and I think in this match we learned that until it's over, we can't celebrate".
He is not worried that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts, he confides to his players: "You never try to reach a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you have to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were ready, unfortunately fate prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands but we lost it, that left something in us and let's hope that something like that doesn't happen this time".
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and taste the glory of titles for the first time.
The United States changes the rules for issuing visas
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centre before the interview at the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time shorter.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa processing process at the United States Embassies and Consulates will change.
The new procedure will require most applicants to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centre (ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total cost of the visa will be lower, with no more fees for arranging an appointment, processing the application and delivering the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only a single fee covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for an applicant visa (including a temporary worker visa) and $390 for a business and investor visa.
People who want to renew their visas will not have to go through a consular interview, but will simply go to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
As the biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who require a second interview at the Consular Section will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for visas at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26 USD.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could spell a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that may confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When inviting reporters, NASA assured them that it would present "a discovery that would cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", which aroused speculation from experts in other countries.
This discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were once considered uninhabitable, and that they might one day become intelligent creatures like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that has been considered too toxic for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it's this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that don't have atmospheres like Earth's.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will prove that "there is another, another form of life, different from the one we know".
The Space Agency will announce the true impact of the findings at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón are creating an opposition "block"
The reforms to the Congressional Constitution are leading to the advent of "bipartisanship", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term had not even begun when an opposition bloc was formed in the Congress, led by MPs from the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia (Consensus), and Manuel Jesús Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" in the House.
Before the start of the session for the opening of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "brought down" the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excluded them.
This reform, they repeated, begins "dipartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the PRD party coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brites of the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms constitute an institutional political marginal at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and the PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will and if they do not have it, they will be subjected again to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When [the opposition coalition] came here, I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that they are in agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and will therefore form a plurality group.
It is not possible, he continued, to allow Congress, once monopolistic, to become "bipolar".
The intent of the bill is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
The group started with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, added Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that the Congress has become "the prey" of two parties - the PAN and the PRI.
"It used to be controlled by one party, now it's divided between two".
Patron Montalvo asked that the MP's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"To ensure that we five Members, who are probably already nine, but who are now five, are not left out because of agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed, we are outside, and we do not agree with this reform".
Another 200,000 pesos are being spent on the "supplier"
The city council in Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the company that supplies the electrical equipment.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the city council to Lorena Guadalupe Camachova Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material in this second half of the year to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall's transparency page, this latest check, number 9258447, was sent on November 16 of this year, was issued for the amount of 200,144.56 pesos and stated as its subject matter "the settlement of unpaid payments".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for selling at high prices, a further amount.
What wasn't said is the total amount the city still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, like other suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last one on November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states for companies inspected by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer assured that she did not re-use the services of the City's contractor.
In the past, after 25 July, the Noroeste daily published an audit of the checks issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the City of Camachó Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
She also conducted transactions with Jumapam, where she cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist Places Need to Be Maintained
Tourism managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Sanchez Taboada's residence in Mazatlan.
After a foreign tourist fell deep into the Sanchez Taboada cliff, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and thus do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Business Association, recalled that they had repeatedly asked for attention to be paid to the destination's impression, and for the bad things that tourists find there to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects the tourists who walk around and see the mess, which adversely affects the nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business in one day, and they have no idea of the revenue that's being lost, or they wouldn't have solved these issues so long ago without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist drop was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city.
"The council will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just fixing existing faults", he said.
We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should do maintenance, because we as citizens deserve clean housing, the city should change its strategy of maintaining the city".
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer).
"Today, to attract tourists, it is not just about promotion, it is about offering a good product, a city with clean beaches and streets, where tourist attractions are constantly maintained", he said.
"It has not been given the attention it deserves, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, the lack of maintenance.
He talked about a number of places that need to be fixed in cooperation with the city hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and tidy to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that rescuing tourist sites in Mazatlán was urgent because they were not being used properly and did not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites, but these will need to be cleaned up first in order to attract them and put them on the list we have for promoting this destination".
IP is asking Congress for results.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like the MPs to take on a great responsibility by leading by example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period of decent work and no agreement between the parties and the State Executive is what the business sector in Mazatlán demands, as Sinaloa is mired in convulsions and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th parliamentary term began, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI, 13 PAN, three Partido Nueva Alianza, two PRD, one PT, one Convergencia and the last PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The expectation list for new members of Congress is that they can exercise decent leadership, with commitments to society and to various fields that require responsible legislative work, and that the same partisan and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the 40 recently elected members of Congress take on great responsibility and lead by example in the path to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect the MPs to actually exercise their right, without any agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary groups".
He therefore spoke of the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary intersections to move the ruling class forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and be committed to society and the sector first of all, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives would be to combine all forces in an effort to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
Most importantly, they should stimulate economic growth, create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation.'
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it more weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that it is the second lowest budget ministry, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currency and investment, which in addition directly competes with agriculture".
In addition to spending money on startup tourism projects, Congress should help bring the state to safety and help with the alcohol law that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
Searching for the Three Kings
Dolls, cars, and bicycles are among the toys on the Coronado Valenzuel family's children's wish list.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their dreams of the coming Three Kings Festival, as their household numbers exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not give up hope that Kaspar, Melichar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it is difficult because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the 'plebeians' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuelova Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he'd wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would want a one-year-size outfit.
"He (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I said, 'We'll see my son,' because it was very expensive", Cayetano recalls sadly.
For older kids who were just in school, it would be the perfect outfit and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, and eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
14-year-old Jose Juan is missing sneakers, so he could use a size five and a half or a size six.
To help fulfill the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuel children, you can join the "Three Kings in Search" campaign and bring a gift or cash at the Noroeste newspaper reception.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Dozens of searches were carried out in Estria on Wednesday as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The searches were made in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce it were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including two alleged bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to appear at the Palace of Justice in Sherbrooke after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing cannabis, possessing it for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections followed a long-term investigation lasting almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 officers from the Estrie Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec City Police, the Sherbrooke Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand squarely with the party that built the gravel under your feet", declared Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by lawmakers after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a bill that would allow the detention of up to one year of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading for the wrong end.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does", Mr Duceppe said.
NPD critic Olivia Chow on the immigration issue has rejected critics who want her party to be weak on illegal immigrants.
"The NDP agrees that we take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be a key part of another bill, C-35", Ms Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and jails children for at least one year", Ms. Chow explained.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition parties.
"Canadians are telling MPs collectively that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that take Canada by surprise and treat it like a pathogen".
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to an election leading to its rejection.
One Conservative told QMI that the government would call for a vote to hold any MP who opposes to the bill accountable to his constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and corruption, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry into the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to make sure that this idea does not fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue as early as January next year.
The Met has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council of the Police Service of Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
It took little more than that for the public security critic, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate the announcement as "a rabbit in a hat" and "an amateurish solution on the knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll settle for confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it".
"We are aware of this problem".
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for the establishment of a public hearing of witnesses.
"Furthermore, Mr. Charest insists he doesn't want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I do, that he's hiding something", he explains.
"The only way to get a commission of inquiry is to dismiss Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
To break this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General", he decided.
He also feels that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent task force is not the only proposal in the Charest government's files.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it more appropriate for this type of crime.
This request would have been based on the authorised representative for the Marteau operation (Hammer), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
Federal Public Safety Secretary Vic Toews has confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments related to this file.
In the 2001 Operation Spring, which targeted biker groups, despite the fact that the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had the Gangster Act amended.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several water flows have been placed under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
There was another landslide tonight in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is paved.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, from 40 to 70 millimeters.
Another 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The northern sections of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the hardest hit.
It could drop a total of 100 millimeters.
If we add these precipitations to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can fear flooding in some waterways.
Quebec's fire department issued a flood warning Wednesday night for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become subject to flood alert and continuous controls.
In the Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to flood, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down by heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the discharge of some lakes from the shores has caused the closure of some roads, in particular in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The emergency services are on alert and monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center issued a severe flood warning Wednesday for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partly blaming
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial defeat before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Board (RRTV) for controversial statements about welfare and Haitians, as well as for rude language during broadcasts.
The Broadcasting Board believes that Mr. Dupont and his group at CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on welfare and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians in rude language that does not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their own lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint from the Joint Front des bénéficiaires de l'aide sociale du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts reported in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, host Stephane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the message was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the 'Dupont Noon News' have struck a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner".
No reprimand was ever made.
The last controversy was over a statement made after the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort got into a media shoot-out that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host stated that he did not send any donations to help the Haitians because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of Haitians.
"I've already paid my three-day delay on the thing".
"My file has been untouched for a year and a half", the presenter declared.
In all its decisions, the Commission refuses to use rude language in broadcasting.
In any event, CHOI-FM cooperated 'beyond its duties'.
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within three days.
King of the Kung Fu in Montreal.
Montreal resident Nacereddine Zemmal, originally from Algeria, has an extremely peculiar temperament.
An athlete who excels in sandy (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing, and Thai boxing enters tatami and rings around the world, looking for new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for matches pretty much everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game that appears in martial arts, competitions in North America are rare".
Recently, this security guard and UPS assistant just gave his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he said.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the World San Sho Cup".
"The top four finishers in each category at the last World Championships have been invited".
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007 in China I finished fifth in the tournament, while in 2009 in Toronto I finished third", he added.
"The interesting thing is that in every competition I've made some progress".
"At this rate, I'll be first this year or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the pitch and less often in the ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
However, Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This is the highest and most prestigious competition in China", explains the nice guy.
"It's kind of like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzing".
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category".
"Then the winners of each category will battle to be crowned the one and only champion, the king of kung fu".
450 million without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed, by mutual agreement, to award 450 million in contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor,which has won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of 295 million dollars without a public tender.
This consortium, Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004, in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec, to entrust the private sector with the management of this major hydroelectric project worth USD 5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium won a lucrative contract without any call for competition.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of undertakings poses a serious ethical problem which risks excluding competition and causing prices to rise.
"It's a new way to realize the collision and eliminate the competition".
"It means that people are no longer making side deals in secret, they are now making them openly", PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard asked the National Assembly this question because he says he is very concerned about how the public interest can be sold like this.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, strongly denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way", she said, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacking in accuracy".
She said it would be the least of her apologies to PQ.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex, given the scale of the work.
Construction is already underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being negotiated; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of the engineering consultancy consortium is the subject of a government investigation.
If we swiftly fly through the business register of Quebec companies, we can discover over 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been established.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, namely CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular that 'the Bay James region is characterised by a special labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s'.
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), has given an explanation which forces us to face the fact that the contract for the management of the project was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public tender and there are few tenderers bidding, your bids may be higher".
"You have two choices: you take the people who are in the contract as contestants, and you say, 'Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and good value.'
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of the people", Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 that the Parti Québécois has received.
The contracts were awarded to Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil sample analysis.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without holding a stake in 'Energie gérance'.
All the contracts were closed.
The total is $449,783,344, including the contract with Energy Gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau omitted a report that PQ was also linked to the companies that 'fund' it, before specifying that it was more about its management staff.
The responsible consumption barometer - the 'green' label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Québec consumer has little confidence in the sustainability actors, but also in the 'impartial' labels and eco-certificates to guide his product selection.
The worst thing is that even as we bathe in a media universe that urges us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to meet obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, reports Barometre Consumption Responsible, whose first article appeared yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them are still not very confident
Two-thirds of us actually say we don't believe in the environmental promises of companies, simply because the green advertising of companies detects a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that label themselves as environmentally responsible, reports Barometre.
Similarly, the debate among politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be a priority to stimulate this side of consumption, which is now being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Barometre has identified, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the statistics on the "green" products or services we are looking to get our hands on.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products in order to respond to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them preferred to buy from local merchants and preferred to buy food grown in their region, reports Baromètre.
More green and responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving to minimize its impact on the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But their social and environmental awareness is clearly left somewhere outside their car, reports Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or recommend using a car for at least two people to protect nature.
Walking and cycling also supported the behavior of 39.1% of the participants in this large-scale survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company Angus et le Parallèle, which sought a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a lover of the art of cinema, did not get what it asked for.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government is proposing a loan, which would otherwise be lower, which was the initial expectation, which could lay the foundation for a viable solution on favourable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests had already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by François Macerola, President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), who manages the eXcentris film project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to reply.
However, it seems that the state gift hypothesis must indeed be rejected.
It should be recalled that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de centres de cinéma du Québec opposed direct State investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion have demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got the cinema art into his premises within a decade after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which could have been the reason for the change by the state finance board.
There's a shortage of independent theaters in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its helm, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the hope of securing $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three theaters on February 27th of next year and showcase Xavier Beauvois's most beautiful film, Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir and so he ignores it, he and his group think about the proposals for reductions that are made to him.
The curtain is raised on Canada as a whole...
New American diplomatic sources made known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of Canadian inferiority to Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
Four new reports, including the US Embassy in Ottawa and the US Embassy in Washington, released to the public yesterday, provide additional sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets being discussed by political leaders.
Much to the surprise of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"Canada's near-constant inferiority complex is conditioning potential political leaders to talk about domestic stakes instead of realizing that these elections apply to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
"The United States is thus", he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the party or better still the party leader to manage these important relationships should be the key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls".
Another expression of this sense of importance can be found in a message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's continued support in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, which Canada will publicly admit to its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan", writes Breese.
There is no mention of the government having to postpone the Christmas session of parliament to avoid defeat by the coalition and that the opposition parties are conditioning their survival on the quality of the proposed reconstruction plan.
Another report, from January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws attention to the increasingly negative image of the United States from the dramatic series aired on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts from Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which have been observed to contain not very subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even abductions for the purposes of violent interrogation at the CIA.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some of the prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner replied that he would, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paperwork relating to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the Secretary of State".
"Secretary accepted with the understanding that she would review the file".
Let's just say that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
It's been reported and Mike Huckabee in the United States has heard about it.
Worldwide plan for the restoration of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to restore lighting in homes, shops and industrial spaces in 100 countries, with the goal of achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that is nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planet's climate between now and 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of hard-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of the industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent light bulbs or, better still, LEDs, a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet from lighting would be reversed.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the entire fleet of cars on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with significant emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GHG emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we're going to have to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize global warming at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to avoid it getting out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5% is the product of light.
With fluorescent light bulbs, we reduce energy consumption by 75%, and with new LED bulbs, we reduce that consumption by a factor of two.
Fluorocompact bulbs have an average lifespan of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as the one Philips introduced this week - the company reportedly participated in a UN study - have a projected lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a burnt bulb, giving us a sense of the potential savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs, because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection centres.
However, the report states that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorescent light bulb, but rather the thermal coal plants, which emit a lot of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in the light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the benefits that each country would derive from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants costing 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the immediate publication of the results of the Ivorian presidential election after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the preliminary results without delay", the UN president's spokesman stressed.
'Requests all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the latest date - midnight on Wednesday - to expire without releasing the results, three days after the Sunday vote.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls around the world for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara, multiplied.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" voting in the north, which has been run by former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the FN (New Army) voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country have discouraged the supporters of the president of Côte d'Ivoire from going to the polls.
The elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dre, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any links to former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the results because he knows he has suffered losses and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election, which took place on Sunday, was seen as the crowning achievement of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the political faction in Ivory Coast on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara,who gained the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas regions), according to provisional data with seasonal adjustment (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolitan area is 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed for 9,3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9,7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 percentage point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market has worsened further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 who were literally out of work.
As regards the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6,4% in metropolitan France (+0,2 points over three months as in the year), i.e. 482 000 persons aged 50 and over and 6,6% including overseas regions.
Only the population aged 25-49 years benefited from the stability of unemployment at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to compile monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and a brother of the PS Bouches-du-Rhône board, was charged and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly subversive public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misappropriation of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, bribery, accepting bribes to influence the government, and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions the judge is going to ask him, and not some delusions".
"It's easy to prosecute him for many criminal reasons, but it's another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client was questioned.
Mr Guérini stated through his lawyers that he sent the judge a brief statement before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his close associates, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the landfills he was supposed to run.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he never knew anything of the kind, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former general manager of services for the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and left the protagonists of the whole affair free under judicial supervision with a restraining order.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation for all the facts that are being brought against him".
"The investigating judge will look into it and let him go", said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released on Tuesday night, with two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy State Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is charged with accepting bribes for the purpose of influencing the office and with passive corruption.'
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "the embezzlement and misuse of company property", the other for "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing the misuse of company assets".
Among those confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a similar case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped launder money from a large-scale gangster ring.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill at La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the Marseille Metropolitan Municipality (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: the Elysian Palace overreached by mediating Syria
Over a period of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", united opinion in France, put diplomacy on a combat alert and highlighted the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
All of this is being closely watched by U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to advise them on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by US justice for insidious trafficking of materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they shed a bright light on the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything about it.
The diplomatic cable written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled: "Iran: French comments on the hostage situation".
The strategic adviser at the Élysée, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the US diplomat, Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do as much to be repatriated as their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "continuously emphasize" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "instant liberation".
We need to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more, the more they ask you to stop".
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "silence solves nothing", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of 'political blackmail'.
It announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (to be held on 16 August, the day she is granted asylum by the French Embassy) "will require payment of a large financial sum to the Iranians" (€230,000 bail).
And announce that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that will "be intensified".
The Iranians "could arrest an additional 1,800 French people living in Iran in the future", he says.
28 August 2009
Klotilda Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she's still locked up in Iran.
Information spreads: Majid Kakavand, an Iranian who the United States says was deported for illicit trade in sensitive electronic material related to Iran, is released in Paris by a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing match.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to acquire material intended for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has joined the negotiations?
Freeing an Iranian for freeing a young French woman?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysian court, he says, was not only "surprised by the judge's decision" but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by French intelligence.
The Elysee Palace counselor pulls out a phone number, hangs up the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy".
At the time of Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, through negotiations, communiqués and organised leaks to the media, to convince Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad that he is playing a "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blitz" of French officials.
The Embassy in Paris asks what is the basis for the "gratefulness" expressed towards Assad.
"Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The documentary then explores the reasons that made the Elysian Palace pay off in this fiction.
Intensive communication "aims to validate the policy of opening up to Syria by President Sarkozy", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the role of Syria", Paris is trying to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them anyway".
"This should at least create confusion and ambiguity among Iranians".
Clotilda Reiss is returning to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving her at the Elysee Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecival" that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, officials said.
The bill will be introduced to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for people under 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the senior official in charge of the draft law, told AFP.
Online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the law, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official in charge added.
It will also make available to people who request it, free programs to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected", and the daily press regularly reports various facts related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed world champion in online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 FIFA World Cup: FIFA determines the host countries for the tournament, which will be held in the following months:
Full of unrest over suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday sets the host country for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a choice overwhelmingly politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk outpacing the technical criteria.
The thing is, the 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Europe, the traditional home of the sport (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to either win new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its 2010 African premiere, or continue to be staged in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities attending the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Prince of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of the economic and political stakes around the world.
The negotiations behind the scenes risk going to the last minute.
For the rest, it's difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of an advantage to the State in the form of State aid.
But those reasons won't carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour set for the vote.
The Sunday Times at the start of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the European Commission for corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of their country, a cradle kicked, which has so far only hosted the World Cup once a year.
The BBC put the crown on the line on Monday when it aired a documentary that "pinned" three influential members of the EC (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA unhappy and get the English top officials in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the bid to host the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new lease of life with the EC?
Nothing is less certain, as the Spain-Portugal pairing does not lack the triumphs of the already-prepared stadiums, its goodwill (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided that the championship would not be held in Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in word hints barely twisted to the English press' accusations against members of the EC (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them", Mr Putin declared.
For 2022, the United States, with its considerable experience from 1994, seems to be the logical favourite.
The world's most powerful economy, home to the top sponsors of FIFA, this country seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have come up with a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which passed the "test" together in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which FIFA is eager to win, has made Asian chances for 2022 null and void.
With Qatar pulling out the big ace in futuristic stadiums and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries pose more risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could be blamed for the shoddy TV (time-shift) fees paid by European countries, which are the driving force behind FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand has given the impression of hesitation.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not hesitated in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they did.
The mandate for the Elysian Palace calls for someone else.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But transparency doesn't go well with the secrecy that comes with being president.
So you have to act like doubts are constant.
In both senses.
In 2006, unbelievably, Jacques Chirac's friends were making demands that a third term be ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he will decide sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminded the UMP parliamentarians at the Elysee Palace on Wednesday evening, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was a statement, not an announcement.
This isn't the first time he's made humorous references to the presidential election at these meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half years with me", he said in July 2009.
May 2010 rebellion: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage".
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; it will not make him a candidate any less.
If they're causing any comment, it's because of the double truth.
Speeding up the road to running for the D.P., on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the Ségolène Royal's clubhouse, pressing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
It is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS want a regimentation into the fighting formations rather premature than intended.
Bad polling on the other side.
First, the right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this matter with the UMP", people in the Prime Minister's immediate vicinity reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win", Alain Juppé corrects, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the exit from the crisis or, at the very least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European demand is bound to make it difficult for the issuing institutions to be so categorical, under the threat of a deterioration of the already tense situation on European securities markets.
The political price would be all the higher.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in helping to resolve the debt crisis of the European states.
She did not say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
'I would like to express my thoughts to my European partners (...) '
The evening before, in Brussels, during his questioning by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, content to say that the secondary market bond purchase programme was "continuing" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its base fixed interest rate at 1%, its historic low since May 2009.
In fact, the European Central Bank's treasury bond purchases have doubled in the past week to almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And thanks to the misunderstanding of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
The total purchases by the Eurosystem central banks since May 2010 totalled EUR 67 billion.
There is no doubt among market negotiators that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Even economists don't expect any major changes in the exchange rate.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter shall make unlimited liquidity provision on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine she would change her program in any significant way".
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating new short-term tensions", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
'The progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,' predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to the Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds that the ECB's intervention plan in the public debt market "would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases in order to revive a sluggish market".
Given the exposure of European banks to the euro area sovereign debt markets, they have no choice but to maintain their market presence.
"It needs to make up for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in a way that prevents the bursting of the most fragile states' payments", a prominent bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, countries will be more concerned about reducing their debt than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is backing down
After a start of the week for Italy, the situation has eased somewhat, with a return on interest on 10-year bonds yesterday.
Back to the temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the Presidents of the Regions said that they had heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as "irresolvable" and that he expected a "unpredictable" weekend, which was later denied by the participants.
In any case, the deviation from long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points on Tuesday, and the price of CDSs soared to 263 points, causing some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation from German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "turbulent market developments" and a possible outbreak originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and uncodified, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of significant fiscal inputs, which go hand in hand and put the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will be 4,3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3,9% forecast by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Hence the rumor of a new set of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to €7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken", said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we've been saying it for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Executive Board under pressure from Italy.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilization effort required in Italy is smaller than the effort required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the election could begin, which is expected to take place at the end of March.
This would open up a period of time which is not particularly suitable for decisions in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking of strengthening their counter-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: 'I think the Europeans demonstrated this all day and night on Sunday, they are clearly very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency area.'
Although everything is relative, the expansion we saw yesterday in interest rates on European government bonds has brought water to the mill for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt record, the target of the most speculative speculation.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clarity in the policies, which are mainly based on banking systems", says Exane BNP Paribas economist.
Especially since "political time is slower than market time".
Aware of this disruption and the danger it poses, European countries are stepping up discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts are progressing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Group starting early next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
The programme is devoted to unconventional market-oriented support measures for euro area countries (see above).
As for the European Financial Fund (EFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the developments in Europe.
If the objective of this route is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for achieving that objective.
The first issue of the EFSF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in the funds mobilized by additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The countries concerned, first and foremost Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are coupled with strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, seeking international assistance before they have applied their own budgetary adjustments and decided on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Finally, the participants in the European funds are talking about the options available to accelerate the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-engage in the stockpile of securities.
The economists at Barclays Capital, which is a player in the very first European sovereign debt deal, consider that an additional €100 billion would be sufficient, 'preferably' in the form of direct liquidity provision.
The instrument exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been subsidised to date by €60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snowfall is still causing traffic problems, particularly on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now under an orange emergency for the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne joined the 20 districts already under an orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and slight snowfall in the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and coverage of 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the regions of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions are affected by the measures.
Snowfalls are large enough to cause traffic disruption and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some districts have banned heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tonnes on the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, police say, and they recommend that you only drive when it is absolutely necessary, and some trucks have been cancelled for the day.
Schools in Picardy have been banned from meeting on Thursday.
No special measures are planned to restrict freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district office "calls on all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt to the nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services should contact their airline.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on transport modernization in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been pouring in.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion Grand Paris metro project, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable the construction to start, the State announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is an amount which will then allow SGP to use part of its financing from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first amendments.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which is being considered by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and the increase of the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, that it is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the restructuring of the existing office rate 'in order to modernise it in order to increase the revenue generated by it and to affect the increase to Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would that be?
It's a delusion.
It's not in the text.
We're a long way from 4 billion.
'It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of capital grants to be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project', we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
For us at SGP, this system doesn't seem shocking.
"Once we've generated revenue, we can cover the study for three years and then go to 4 billion, it explains here".
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as needed".
SGP considers that the 2014 budget will be allocated EUR 4 billion only in 2013.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion belong to non-existent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7th.
Vengeful Hackers and Avid Intelligence
The WikiLeaks case has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, there is a blatant scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and it foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's sex life are what everyone has been reading in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi owned), and the unfortunate caricatured profile of Gaddafi has long been the subject of sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents should only consist of reports that are already known is fundamental to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore that specializes in esoteric literature, you will find that each work repeats (the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
Not only is the author of occult texts reluctant to seek out new information (or to find out where to look for information that does not exist), but those who practice it believe only what they already know and that confirms what they have learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited spirit) the head of the secret service (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération), who only believes what he admits to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to a government agency was the same as that published by Newsweek a week earlier.
Why, then, was there so much hype about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly out for dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have been transformed into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public disgraces the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could get the most top-secret information in the most powerful country in the world is a severe blow, not insignificant, to the prestige of this government agency.
Scandal affects both victims and perpetrators.
But let's move on from there to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, it was possible to hold all power, like some Big Brother, controlling the every move of his people.
Orwell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every move by telephone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, has made the citizen a complete victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate, as we do now, that even the tombs of the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can power be maintained if it can no longer keep its own secrets?
It's true that Georg Simmel said that a true secret is a bottomless secret (and a bottomless secret can never be revealed); it's also true that any information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a topless secret because it's pulled out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was a bottomless secret is to take away all of her power.
WikiLeaks didn't do anything wrong with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound to the endowed power?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be like posting it on a street corner poster.
But it's also quite obvious that with today's technology, it's pointless to hope that you can keep a message on the phone classified.
There's nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future ?
I know that my prediction for now is science fiction, and therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials discreetly carrying out formalities on uncontrollable routes, carrying only the messages they know by heart or, rather, hiding precious information in the heel of their shoes.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-locked drawers: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now moves sideways forward, which means backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutioned communications, the Internet rehabilitated the wire-based telegraph.
Video tapes (analog) allowed cinema lovers to record a film step by step, sliding it back and forth and revealing all the secrets of editing, whereas now CDs (digital) only allow you to jump through chapters, i.e. macroregions.
By express train, we can reach Milan from Rome in three hours, while the journey by airplane and the transportation it involves takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communication technology are returning to horse-drawn carriages.
One last note.
Other times the press tried to understand what was being concealed in the embassy.
Now it's the embassies that are requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the progress made by developed countries in delivering on their promises of rapid unblocking (also called fast start) financing.
And the great French hacks were exposed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled out the big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to funding fast start: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations, invaluable and valued for their true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it has made €2.2 billion available in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its pledge of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the details, we find that things are much more complicated.
The financing is 'new and additional' under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is realised without detriment to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, has taken 2009 as a reference year: international funding has been maintained and it is adding 150 million to the three-year Fast Start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with ODA deadlines.
In contrast, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the overall level of public development aid d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of aid granted by France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) in order to comply with its commitment to finance 'new and additional' ...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, think that 1 euro lent is equal to 1 euro given.
Obviously, it's hard to prove: the effort is incomparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments which are profitable (often these are emission reduction projects involving more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro we receive as equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not understand it as the title of our commitments but as the price of the loan to the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only justify itself by saying that it 'meets' its commitment of €420 million, of which 91.5% is a loan (€389.8 million) and 8.5% is a donation (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan on such a scale.
Germany has claimed 46% of the funds, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, if the absolute majority of the European Union gives 1 euro to fulfill its promise, France gives only 10 cents and considers this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful piece of cake!
In summary, France's 'fast start' financing is based on a double-entry approach: on the one hand, the stock's evolution over time and, on the other, the real financial burden.
Although it spends only €36.1 million, it can convince that it spends €420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why should member states continue to donate when all they need is to lend?) and in negotiations because developing countries are not completely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its accounting practices for 2011 and 2012, in line with its commitments and in a spirit of decency and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on long-term financing contributions (another key chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of 'sufficiency' or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France should change its attitude to become as progressive in these deposits as it is in others.
So everyone's hopes are in the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizeta, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of a fast start by France and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international trust necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alert about pesticides that children will ingest.
A 10-year-old child will ingest 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study released Wednesday by the Future Generations Association.
The association, which points out that its results "are not of significant statistical value given the low number of samples analysed but are characteristic of the problem being addressed", bought between July and September four meals of food normally consumed and one light meal as a light snack per child for about a decade in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, which include the official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sweets, have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are classified as clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptors to the PE glands, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we can clearly see in our research that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking", the association states.
Breakfast butter and milk tea alone contain about ten residues with potential carcinogenic effects and three that have been shown to be certain carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apples imported from Brazil, which the study described as a snack, contained traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans included in the lunch, which the study found to contain strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, ground beef, canned tuna, and even caterpillars and chewing gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water was tested for nitrate and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not escape analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this 'cocktail of contaminants' is probably underestimated,' the study concludes.
The Green Europe Group (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on pesticides to stop the "growth of civilization diseases" in the "face of an emergency".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
