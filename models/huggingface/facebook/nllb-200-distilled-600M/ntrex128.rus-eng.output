Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to go to the mappeets
Some members of the National Assembly are dissatisfied with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (from English Member of the Welsh Parliament  member of the Parliament of Wales) for their names.
The problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour Party member expressed concern that the new abbreviation rifmings Twp and Pwp.
For our readers, it's not Welsh: in Welsh twp means tuppitsa, and pwp kacka.
According to the member of the Assembly from the Welsh Party, his organisation as a whole was unhappy and offered other options.
Conservative party officials are not opposed to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced approximately like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently working on a draft name change bill, made the following statement: "The final decision on the names of the Assembly Members will, of course, remain with them".
The National Assembly for Wales is authorised by the Welsh Government Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the 'Parliament of Wales' instead of the 'Assembly' found widespread support among the local population.
As regards the names of the Assembly members, the Committee expressed preference for the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are offering other options, but the presiding member, Elaine Jones, will find it difficult to find a solution that will appeal to everyone.
The reform laws will also include other modifications to the Assembly's working process, including new rules on disqualifying Assembly members and the structure of the Committee system.
The Assembly members will vote for the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is to resolve a longstanding dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name Republic of Macedonia implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly expressed opposition to its northern neighbor's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgy Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has said he will not recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the country's name  is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in the parishes of Harlem: the bell of St. Martin is silenced forever
"The elders I spoke to said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Adams says.
And now there's none left.
The disappearance of bars can be understood as follows:
The communication format has changed.
The bar ceased to be a kind of living room for the whole district, where they came regularly.
But what worries the churches is that the proceeds from the sale of assets will be short-lived, no matter how much their leaders rely on it.
He added that a multi-unit house would be built on the site of the church, and residents would not be expected to support the remaining parishes.
"Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white", Adams said. "And it will be close to the day when these churches will finally close down, because the new neighbors will never become their parishioners".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first Methodist parishioners left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, where blacks were denied employment or promotion.
In 1939, the building suffered extensive damage as a result of a fire, and during the restoration work, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, who succeeded him as head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells for the poor".
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it something else: a cultural heritage and a unique historical tool.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that the St. Martin's church carillon was the world's first instrument of its kind played by a black musician, Dioniscio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Merrieuser, the church of St. Martin still hasn't found a replacement.
In the last few months, a difficult situation has developed around St. Martin's Church with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Church's diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese would try to transfer the cost of the work to the parish council, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed displeasure at the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark shot a 13-year-old diver who was working in the lobster industry.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old California diver was attacked by a shark and sustained bodily injuries.
The attack happened around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV (San Diego) that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning and about half an hour later he heard the boy crying for help.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was happy to catch the lobster, but he soon realized he was screaming, "I'm bitten!"
I was bitten!
As he approached the diver, Hammel noticed that his skin around the tip was completely torn.
I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: "Here's a shark!"
The boy was taken by helicopter to Reddy Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark attacking the teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a rescuer, told a press briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was not listed as a threatened species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury plans to take over the UK perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury's going to set up a cosmetics and perfume department at Butts, SuperDrag and Debenhams with cosmetics consultants, modeled after luxury department stores.
The UK perfume and perfume market is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while sales in fashion and home goods are falling. To capture a significant share of this desirable market as an experiment, spacious cosmetics and perfume departments will be introduced in 11 stores across the country, and if successful next year, many more stores are expected to do so.
Supermarket owners looking for shelves that used to be used for TVs, microwave ovens, home goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market are good solutions.
According to Sainsbury, the range of cosmetics is expected to double to 3,000, including the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, as a type of merchandise organization at Booth stores.
In addition, the branded product line Butique-cosmétique will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products to meet the demands of young shoppers.
Two Sainsbury's stores will feature fragrance shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Selley Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet and the tendency to buy small amounts of food every day in small shops near home have led to supermarkets having to attract customers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury's, says outlets will gradually become department stores, and his supermarket chain is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight with cheap stores like Aldy and Liddle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury's supermarkets have Argos outlets, and some of them have now been Habitat's stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago, which has led to increased sales of food products and revenue from those acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new lease on life to its cosmetics and pharmacy departments have failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was formed between Seinsbury and Butts, but later there were differences between the participants over the distribution of pharmacy sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsbury pharmaceutical business (total 281 stores) to Selecio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury La Roche-Posay and Vichy skincare products to its four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's: "We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favorable environment for our customers.
We also invited specially trained counselors who would always be willing to help with advice.
Our range of brands, a pleasant design and convenient location will attract a lot of visitors to look for cosmetics and perfumes.
Peter Jones has reacted angrily to Holly Willoughby's exit from the £11 million deal.
Star of the show Dragon's Log Peter Jones is angry at the departure of TV presenter Holly Willoughby from the £11 million deal she was planning to make with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead opts for new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Goop's actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the show announced her decision on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon Logos.
Our sources report that Jones was "outraged" when a fan favorite during a tense meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday admitted that after signing new contracts worth up to $1.5 million she would not have enough time to buy their shared brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
Their brand was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow's baby, and it was expected that its sales would double Willowby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram, and Jones himself left the UK on a private plane to one of his villas.
According to one source, Truly's brand was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision shocked all parties involved.
Everyone was stunned by Tuesday's events, as the stamps were still weeks away.
There's a whole warehouse at Marlow headquarters full of merchandise ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the UK's most popular star this morning could cost the firm millions of pounds because of significant investments in goods from pillows and candles to clothing and potential delays in the line.
It is also a matter of breaking up longstanding friendships.
Raising three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over the company's board in March.
The two couples often spend their holidays together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of Dan Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of ITV's Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We can't comment on his business dealings".
Difficult negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media's criticism of him for the president's undignified comments and positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse to accept such claims?
Trump said, mimicking the voice of the news anchor.
I didn't give up on anything.
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step toward reducing North Korea's nuclear weapons stockpile.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho addressed world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday with a statement that North Korea still awaits "appropriate retaliation" from the US after the DPRK's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S., the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
Things are going great with North Korea, he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a wonderful relationship.
Trump said his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have paid off: missile tests have been ended, hostages have been released, and American soldiers who remained in the DPRK have also returned home.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there was nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but instead of the 10,000 people on the street who are rushing into this crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, deaths estimated in the hundreds
In the first few days after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost their roof over their heads, the government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which is a mandatory condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, so it was not easy", says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palos, but we don't know if the foreign team will be able to work on site.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is evaluating the situation in Palau to determine the feasibility of involving international organizations.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Acheche, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, the Palo was not equipped with a warning siren, which most likely resulted in so many casualties.
Transportation between the many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital, previously based in Lombok to help earthquake victims, is heading to Palau, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made strengthening Indonesia's outdated infrastructure a highlight of his campaign and has spent countless money on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko's administration, which is running for a new term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president is also criticized for the intensification of interfaith enmity between Indonesia's conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more were left homeless as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arrows and other self-defense weapons.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score against Chelsea with a goal in the far top corner of the goal
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge.
Starridge received a pass from Jernan Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and drilled into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and landed in the far top corner of the net.
Goalkeeper Cape Arrissabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said: "It was all about being in this position and getting the ball, players like Shaq always play the best offense, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible".
I saw Kant coming towards me, got the ball and, shortly after, knocked on the door.
In the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 with the goal scored by Belgian Eden Azar in the 25th minute.
Chelsea's central striker, passing the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field and broke through half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic played a one-run home run.
And he gave the pass to Azariah, who went out to the gate.
Azar overtook the defense and struck from the left flank to bypass Liverpool goalkeeper Allison Baker, striking the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage, and the match will be played at the Stade de Saint-Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play the club at the UEFA Euroleague match, which will take place on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Management Office said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people are still living under the ruins of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, which caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high on Friday, Supopo Purvo Nugroho, the official representative of the Bureau, told a news conference.
The city of Palú, with a population of over 380 thousand people, was overrun with the ruins of collapsed houses.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation is underway.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with multiple stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Muse complex on John Street.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among local residents.
O'Hagen, the Criminal Police Inspector, says: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I strongly urge anyone who has been to the John Street area of Birkenhead and could have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on a video recorder, please contact us with any information that may help with the investigation.
A police official confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found on the compound.
Presumed acquaintances of the victims arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and the police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Muse complex tried to get into his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned about what had happened, he lost his gift for speech.
Residents were told they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the officers told the resident that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
One woman was crying.
What a horror! She repeated.
At 2 a.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another one was left outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a personal message to @MerPolCC's Twitter subscriber, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 (case 247 of September 30).
The Cromwell Memorial in front of the Parliament Building has sparked a heated debate about the rewrite of history.
Cromwell's exile would be a deserved revenge for the barbaric destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society has called Mr. Crick's proposal a "craziness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the icon-fighting movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering from the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hameau Thornecroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man who many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion is historically accurate remains a matter of debate among scholars.
But we can safely say that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century influenced the further development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also highly regarded and respected.
A Chinese farmer was bitten to death by a pig killer.
In one of the markets in southwestern China, a farmer was the victim of a pig, local media reported.
The victim's bloody body (only his last name,  Yuan, is mentioned in the media) was found with a ruptured artery near a market in the Lupanshū district of Guizhou province in southern China, Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Sinin County, Qinghai province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered the body of Juan, with the door to the neighboring pig barn open.
There was a huge creek in the pigsty with blood on the reel.
During a forensic examination, it was determined that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs were covered in blood and crippled", Wu, a relative of the victim, told Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate cage during the investigation to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that Yuan's family is negotiating with the market administration about compensation for the farmer's death.
There are very few instances of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, USA, severely injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal hooked a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let him go, only to be frightened by his mature wife.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs. According to one Canadian farmer, the pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "launch mechanism" for their undercover aggression.
The pigs are playful,
They're biting and very curious, but they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to instill a sense of respect and respect in your animals, he explained.
Hurricane Rose will bring rain to much of the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves through a zone of cooler water toward the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, it will bring rain and flooding to the northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
As of Saturday morning, 5 a.m. on New York, the cyclone has reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, 360 km southwest of the city of Ponta Euhenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
On Monday, Mexico is expected to receive more than 25 centimeters of rainfall.
Under the influence of tropical moisture, which has fallen into the forming low pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the Southwest in the coming days.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous flooding, mudflow and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, precipitation rates can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mostly in much of Arizona, up to 510 cm of rainfall is expected.
The risk of sudden, rapid flooding due to uneven distribution of tropical rainfall is not excluded.
With the threat of tropical rain, walking in the desert can be a serious risk.
Rains can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause strong winds and dust clouds to rise.
With the advent of the low pressure zone, rains will fall on the coast of southern California.
Rainfall of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause small mudstone flows and create slippery surfaces on roads.
This is the first rainfall since the start of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, Arizona will experience some tropical rainfall, which will spread to other areas by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, the rains will continue in the Four Corners area until Wednesday evening.
In October, the United States will see a sharp drop in temperatures due to the low air temperature in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to strong temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such a sharp drop in temperature will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missuri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will build up and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
In New York City, the temperature could rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States by mid-October.
The Senate hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh were watched by more than 20 million viewers
Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaze Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew the attention of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels on Thursday.
The political standoff over Kavanaugh's candidacy has taken an unexpected turn, with a press release on Friday saying Republican Jeff Flake has offered a condition that the FBI investigate the lawyer's charges within a week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, saying he was 100 percent sure it wasn't.
According to Nielsen, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account the average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network have not yet received data on their audience.
Also, Nielsen ratings don't always take into account the viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison, it's the average audience watching a game of American football in the playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose hosts warmly supported Kavanaugh's appointment: The day-long Senate hearings were watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS's audience was 3.1 million, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC's 2.89 million, while CNN's was 2.52 million, Nielsen reports.
After the hearing, there was no lessening of interest.
There was a real drama Friday with Jeff Flake.
After a moderate Republican senator from Arizona announced his intention to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS caught him on camera on Friday morning en route to a law committee meeting, where he encountered a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him, with his eyes down, getting a bang from angry women on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one of them.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You're the force, while so many women are powerless, trying to explain your position as a woman.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would speak on the subject at a committee meeting.
When the Judiciary Committee was preparing to approve Kavanagh's nomination for judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels broadcast the hearing live.
However, Flake made one condition  to conduct an FBI investigation into these charges against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority had sought.
Flake claims he changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made the final decision after talking to Koons and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect, as it was obvious that Republicans lacked enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of playing a political game around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is arriving at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on the same channel as May's interview, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticized her so-called 'Shakespeare' plan for Brexit, saying he considered the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU 'absolutely ridiculous'.
Death of Wade Sims in a shootout: Police arrested Dayteon Simpson on suspicion of murdering a Louisiana State University forward
Police arrested a man suspected of killing Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge police said 20-year-old Dayteon Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional CBS news channel, police have found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed to killing Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson is being held on $350,000 bail.
The coroner of the eastern Baton Rouge district released a preliminary ruling Friday: The death was caused by a cross-linked gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the local residents who helped conduct the search and seizure that led to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, athletic director at Louisiana State University, thanked law enforcement for their "good faith work to catch a criminal".
Sims was only 20.
The two-foot forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father, Wayne, also played for the Louisiana State University team.
Last season, Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Coach Will Wade issued a statement Friday morning saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused shock and grief for all players.
That's what I've always been afraid of, coach added.
The volcano has covered Mexico with ash.
The Popocatepetl volcano has burned the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center advised residents not to approach the volcano: activity was recorded in its crater and 183 vapour emissions were recorded in a single day.
The Center observed that the volcano often received a roar and a tremor.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users posted photos of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash.
After a magnitude 7.1 Mw earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
The Popokatepetl Volcano (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand-strong rally was held in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalonia's withdrawal from Spain, which had divided the country into two camps.
Police officers were pushing back the independence protesters, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powdered paint at the guards, raising a cloud of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police set up a stakeout to contain the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For several hours, independence supporters chanted: "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!" and their opponents answered with the slogan: "Long live Spain!"
According to local media reports, 14 protesters were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
On October 1, a referendum was held on Catalonia's withdrawal from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish government but became an important milestone for the separatists.
Catalonia voted with a huge margin to withdraw from Spain, but attendance was low because opponents of the withdrawal largely boycotted the referendum.
According to official Catalan sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block the holding of a referendum at the country's polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists staged a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it took a different route.
Electrician Narcisse Termes, 68, who attended a separatist rally in the company of his wife, complains that the hope of Catalonia's sovereignty gains is becoming increasingly slim.
Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying from happiness when they got the chance to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of suspended silence, he says.
In the recent local elections in December, Catalan parties for secession from Spain won a major victory, though with a small margin, but this year their movement is losing supporters as many of the movement's prominent leaders are either on the run or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording a police rally on the phone, said the conflict was heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
The tension is increasing, he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
Participation in the next European Parliament election as a candidate  is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,  he says.
Londonerry: car hit a house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was hit several times by a car; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested.
The raid was made on Thursday around 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Crescent area.
The barrel damaged the gate and the building itself, according to criminal police inspector Bob Blemming's.
There are reports that the car may have been hit by a bow gun.
Livingstone's win over Rangers thanks to a goal from Meng
Dolly Mengi 's first goal guaranteed a win for the team Livingston
With the goal scored, Livingston won an unexpected victory over Rangers, only the second defeat for Scottish club head coach Steven Gerrard in 18 games.
Dolly Mengi's precision hit tied Harry Holt's team with Hibernia in the second place.
Gerrard's club have been left without a win on their way out this season of the Premier League.
On Thursday, the Rangers will play a European League match against the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
Livingston continues their unbeaten streak in the division, having won six games and not lost since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missing moments for Livingstone in a fight with a struggling guest
Holt's coaching staff had to keep track of the numbers from the start. The Rangers clearly couldn't handle their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defensive line, but his weak attempt failed, and then defender Alan Litgow, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball from reaching the net.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their defensive line, counting on dangerous moments in the resumption of play.
That's how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers gave up the free throw, and Livingston took advantage: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a pass to Meng, who scored from the center position.
By that point, the Rangers had the ball in their hands, but the defense of the receiving team was unbeatable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued on the same pattern, although Kelly still had to take a shot from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman with his leg, and Litgow made a wide pass from the standard position.
The balls were constantly hitting the penalty box of Livingston, but all attacks were repulsed, and the two penalty requirements of Glenn Middleton's backup player, one for provoking Halkett, and the second for playing the hand, were not met.
Fenomenal game  Livingstone  analysis
From BBC Scotland  Alasder Lamont, a report from the stadium Tony MacAroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympiad.
Their style and lineup have remained virtually unchanged since their rise to the top of the rankings, and Holt's great credit is being a mobiliser of the team from the very beginning.
He had a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halckett led a splendidly organized defense, and Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall from relaxing.
The Rangers couldn't get in the rhythm.
Although they had some good times with Coach Gerard, they didn't live up to our expectations this time.
In the final minutes of the game, they were not good enough to own the ball, and they only managed to pass the defense of the host team once.
Cold reception of Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and both of the top figures were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to repair relations between the two NATO countries  visit, and already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find an understanding on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey lives in Cologne.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a crowd of 25,000 to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters were in the vicinity to see their president.
Opponents of Erdogan's regime, including Kurds, gathered at the same place to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Accident on the roads of Deptford: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, a car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident happened near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of Deptford, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile and a half from the scene, on Childress Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver had disappeared.
London police say they are currently working to identify the victim and notify his immediate family.
The road is now closed and buses are being diverted to the area.
Long-Larten prison riots: six police officers wounded
According to the Long Lartin administration, six policemen were wounded in riots at the men's prison.
The Long-Lartin (Wustershire) men's prison has been in a state of disorder since Sunday, starting around 09:30 local time.
To quell the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, an opera group called Tornado was called.
The police received minor facial soft tissue damage; they were treated on the spot.
According to the official prison spokesman, specially trained personnel were recruited to solve the incident at Long Lartin Correctional Institution.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our facility, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be turned over to the police and their restraining order may be changed for a longer period.
Long Lartin currently holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that a prison warden had been taken to hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison administration was forced to recruit special operations to calm the rioting prisoners who threw billiards balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit the dry areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of intense tropical cyclone, but this time it's been a hit: early next week, the hurricane Rose, having made its last leap, must pass over the desert of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of rainstorms.
The National Weather Service has already warned of flood risk on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass through the Phoenix Line on Tuesday and rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression, located within 320 km of Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Weather Service, rainfall will fall from 5 to 10 cm, reaching 15 cm in places on the Arizona plateau of Mogollon-Rome.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall may reach up to 2.55 cm, and in some places it may reach 10 cm.
For areas that are overwhelmed by torrential rains, the rain brought by Hurricane Rose can be a blessing, since the region has long been plagued by drought.
Although flooding can be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season that is not happening in the southwestern United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least one severe drought (second in severity), according to weather.com.
First, the storm will hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Ponta-Euchenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has been in a cooler zone on the Pacific coast and is losing its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of tropical storm.
Heavy rain is expected in parts of Mexico, with flood hazards.
From Lower California to the northwest, the Sonora can receive up to 710 cm of rainfall, and up to 25 cm in places,  reports the website weather.com.
Next, the storm will move north through Mexico and will reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical cyclone, and from Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is associated with heavy rainfall in Lower California, the northwestern Sonora and desert areas of the southwestern United States, reports the National Weather Service.
The rainfall is expected to cause dangerous flooding, mudflow in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects arrested in attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was severely stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attempted murder was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After being hospitalized, his condition is assessed as stable.
Four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area that evening, according to Avon and Somerset County Police.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to a crime that may have any video footage of the incident on their cell phone.
Donald Trump: "Cavanaugh has been the target of all the hatred, all the evil of the Democrats".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrats", Trump said at a rally of his aides in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of confirming Kavanaugh's nomination for the Democratic Party, all the hatred, all the malice, came down.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address, categorically rejecting Christina Blaze Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her indictment hearing.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
The vote to approve Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to approve one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unblemished public service record, the president announced to a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly touched on the issue of Kavanaugh's nomination, saying that it was important for Republicans to run for Congress and the House.
There are only five weeks left until the most important election of our lives.
I don't participate in them, but I do participate in the race in a different way, he said.
I'm dressed like a burner and I'm fighting for our great candidates.
Trump believes the Democrats have set themselves the task of resisting us with all their might.
The first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy is due to take place on Friday, the assistant to the Republican Party's top official said.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many by giant waves that swept over the beaches of Sulawesi Island, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
Hundreds of guests at the festival were the first victims of the disaster, and on Friday evening, waves of nearly six metres in height hit the coast, dragging everyone on their way and killing many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
When the storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of immediately fleeing to shelter, and lost their lives, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, official representative of Indonesia's National Disaster Management Authority, told a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come, the water was in the flow of cars, logs, entire houses, the storm destroyed everything in its path,  explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its might.
Some of the people who were present climbed trees, saving their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pal.
The AED's aerial photographs show the ruins of houses, shops, collapsed bridges, and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by the earthquake.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Utilization Agency (BPPT) said the earthquake's energy emissions were about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was more powerful than expected because of the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nuggroho called the damage "large", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found beneath the ruins of the collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured, and 29 are still missing.
Nuggroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Pal, in the Dungal village, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with the Dungal were completely destroyed, no information was received.
The Dungal area is home to more than 300,000 people, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, whose staff and volunteers have already made their way to the disaster zone.
"There's been a tragedy, but it's not over yet", the statement said.
On Saturday, the Authority was criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palua in time, but authorities believe the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in effect.
An amateur video on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building screaming about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to get people's attention on the street.
A few minutes later, the water wall collapses on the shore, taking home and car with it.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, causing a power outage in Palo Alto, making it very difficult for rescue services to do so.
Military transport planes were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian aid, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, government sources report.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed to other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers from the charity World Vision have arrived safely from Dungalla to Pal, where staff find shelter in the broken-down brass tents in the courtyard of their office building.
"They saw a huge number of destroyed houses", he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NGOs have failed to reach Palau.
Indonesian law allows for the attraction of funding, humanitarian aid and staff from foreign organizations only after the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
It is believed to be a local disaster,  reports Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government declares a natural disaster national, we can accept foreign aid, but the status remains unchanged.
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Paula, the friends and relatives of the missing people still hope for their miraculous salvation that will restore the people's faith in the best.
A little boy was rescued Saturday after falling into a sewer drain.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble of a building who had spent two days there, next to her mother's breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paraplanetry team, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I'm not the last person in the sport, and emotionally it's hard to survive", he said.
Gendon recalls how, after learning of the collapse of the Ro Ro Ro Hotel from other parachutists, he spent the next few hours desperately trying to reach out on WhatsApp to his colleagues from Palo who were vacationing at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray dot, not two blue ones.
That means the messages weren't delivered, he says.
The brazen theft of $ 26,750 while servicing a bank in Newport-on-Livy .
On Friday morning, the attackers stole $26,750 from Brink's, a cash register operator in the city of Newport-on-Lewis, according to a Newport Police press release.
According to Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored van took cash from a cash machine in the entertainment complex and was about to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, a man ran from behind Brink's and stole a bag of bank notes to refuel the ATM.
Witnesses said several suspects fled the scene, but police did not say how many were involved.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: Person, formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been using the alias for a long time and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news came on the eve of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will serve as counselor in place of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to emotional issues, the author of the show said.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also has religious meaning.
Ye  is the most common word in the Bible, meaning ty, wy,  so West explained the title of his album in one of his recent interviews with Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us.
First there was Kanye, which means the one, and now I'm just Ye, which means the reflection of all the good, the bad, the incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.
Kanye isn't the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddie or simply Diddie, asked this year to call himself Love (love) or Braza Love (Brotherly Love or Brotherly Love).
West's rapper Jay-Z also changed his name several times: with a deff and without, with letters or lines.
Mexican President solemnly promises not to use military force against civilian population
Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Tlatelolco Square on Saturday, President Lopez Obrador promised never to resort to the army's help to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful student demonstration, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youths through monthly scholarships to study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of prospects for education are leading young people into a criminal world.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for AI development
China and its AI efforts should not be underestimated  The US should double its investment in its research, says Lee Kaifu, an AI investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier, several U.S. departments made statements about AI work, although the U.S. generally does not have a clear AI development strategy.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are way behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in AI", Lee says.
A doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book The Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest ranking player in American Otello, and then he was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with nontraditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
It's not China that's taking in academic leaders, it's corporations, Li believes.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee believes that changes to immigration policy can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to AI candidates", he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li claims.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which partners from industry and science should be involved in, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been taking no action for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but opponents-nationals argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will match the minimum of 50 percent required for a referendum.
The question raised in the referendum was: Do you support NATO and EU membership, provided that the treaty with Greece is accepted?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay the price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of MPs have said they will respect the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it has no binding legal force.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said no reports of violations had been received by 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent at the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", says 62-year-old Josie Tanewski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumitz, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, setting up chairs in front of tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with our heads high, not by insulting the thresholds of the civil cabinets", Kavadarkov says.
Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-worth.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring investment to Macedonia, which is so much needed in this country, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be the key to our prosperous future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that's below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those say they'll vote yes.
For a referendum to take place, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure will be the first major blow to the policy of a pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City bypasses the defence of Brighton to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over the defence of Brighton, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored in the 65th minute, it seemed like he had no problem with it.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker got a pass in the center of the field.
He jumped between three of Brighton's three defenders before breaking out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green shirts.
He's outrunning one defender and outrunning several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, in the penalty area, returned the ball to Aguero in one touch, who hit goalkeeper Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate with his right foot.
Aguero is having some leg problems, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Sky an initial lead in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball, being deep in the territory of Brighton.
He gave a great cut on the left flank at Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before handing the transmission to Sterling on a long-range stick.
The Blue Sky forward scored the goal in the gate just before he flew out of the field.
Manchester City faced off against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Nekkar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is going to take the points from the Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to push things forward.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, one game ahead of the West Division's Los Angeles Dodgers, start to struggle in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least the 7th or 8th spot, but they still hope to secure a first division title.
And while we're playing this way, at least we can hold our ground, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in front of the audience and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss something like this?
The Nationals haven't announced a pitcher for Sunday yet, but according to recent reports, they're inclined to put Sherzer in the position.
Scherzer, who's about to play his 34th game, pitched on Thursday at pitcher's field, and on Sunday, his vacation, he'll pitch.
The right-handed pitcher's statistic is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running for reelection in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republicans coming to the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, the presidential nominee for the Supreme Court.
Everything we did was mapped out in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, although I'm running, fighting for good candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, and we are witnessing malice and disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, and that's what they want, but we're not going to give them power and control.
Democrats, he says, set the goal of resisting and obstructing.
And you've been watching this for the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, ugly and lying.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused a loud outcry from the room.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to leak?
Mm... um... what document?
No, no, body language gave it away, I've never seen body language deny words so much.
The Labour Party is no longer a different-looking organisation.
She's not tolerant of people expressing their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of no confidence in me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of parliament from the Labour Party to have been told that we are not welcome for expressing our opinion.
I have a similar attitude toward my colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe  ironically, these are issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday said that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is what the GC's Friday evening meetings were like.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with many of those meetings, and the promise of a more humane and gentle policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that no differences of opinion are allowed in the Labour Party is becoming increasingly evident, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy took over; colleagues whose political outlook I previously viewed as similar to mine began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions I would never agree with  whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak publicly, no matter what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media calling for an election to be cancelled, condemning the policies of the Centre, or saying I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments on me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never back down.
What's most frustrating about this policy is that this amount of abuse is now considered normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church, and with every vote of no confidence or change in election rules, the party is already.
Over the past two years, I've received a lot of recommendations to sit down and not speak out so I can be okay.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, upset by the Thatcher government's disdainful attitude that literally broke my schoolroom, I've been striving to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most -- whether it's a local MP or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, I never did in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have misinterpreted my political positions and areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who voted for this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is so hard on the road to a Brexit that is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I don't understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only audience I really want to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancellation or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I see fit in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Er 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Er comes in first place
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Er deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennis.
Now they're leading the table, the only undefeated team in the top 10.
After all, it's all because of their excellent defense, and their ability to pick the right moment, which gave the receiving team and coach Peter Mercy the full right to be satisfied.
"All this time we've been tested for strength, and we're still unbeatable, so I have no reason to be sad", Peter Mercy commented.
Robin Christy, Melrose: They did better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Climax led the way, but the yellow card issued for the Warriors to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to advance, and Jason Baggott caught the unrealized attempt.
Klymo increased the gap from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, scoring a point, and then in the break he made a single attempt, making the score 17-5 in favor of Klymo.
But the Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggott cut the gap to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury to Ruard Knott, who got stretched, and after a repeat exit, Er progressed further thanks to the attempt of Stafford McDowell, implemented by Climó.
The current captain, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose was forced to pay his opponents as a player for the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climó without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind the incoming moal Er.
Climax realized the advantage, practically not stopping from the very second exit, after Kyle Rowe was hit by David Armstrong and sent out the extreme forward Gregor Henry on the field's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is about to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to start his career in the hotel industry: it's been revealed that he's been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he also writes and stars alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Craigslist.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kirnan was planning to take part in a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
Our sea: Bolivia, without access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are hung on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are outlined with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to pay him back.
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century conflict over resources is still alive; the desire to swim again through the Pacific is alive.
These hopes may have been the most daring in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 following five years of debate.
Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and balance of mind and, of course, a positive outcome, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadelia.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that a tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's claim that after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president who is fighting a tough re-election battle next year, is also eagerly awaiting a decision on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that if so, that will change little.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to administer Chilean territory and has already said it will not affect the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's decision was made only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, Bolivia's case has not progressed, but has been delayed.
The current administration of Bolivia has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,  says Zarate.
According to her, Morales's militant rhetoric destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to have discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court's decision was made too quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with an exclusive opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements to mutual benefit, he claims.
Calzadelia also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, uses the naval issue as a political bait.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he says.
The court's ruling is an opportunity to reassure ourselves that we need to move on from our past.
North Korea says it won't disarm until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his country will never go to nuclear disarmament unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of their countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is gradually returning to the path of resuming stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri argues that the dream that long-term sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is utopian.
Washington fears it will ratify the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive headwear that promises to go on sale and will be worn right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, there's no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a host of unusual headwear that are part of their SS19 collection and have blinded visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats were gaining popularity among Instagram followers, and designers decided to send their amazing creations to the podium.
A distinguished Valentino: a head beige suit, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included precious stones decorated with turquoise, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but not all of these headwear are designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which was a big hit on Halloween.
Many of these furry masks had their mouths sewn together, and they resembled a portrait of Hannibal Lecter rather than a work of art.
One of the specimens resembled a swimming device with a tube and protective glasses, and the other was melted ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into the mass market right at you.
The huge size of the hat is on the heels of La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The cult label that produced this extremely impractical hat, which gained such widespread popularity on social media, spawned and sent another huge accessory  straw beach bag, almost as big as the model wearing the bag.
The orange bag of burnt raffia with a white leather pen and raffia scarf was a bright specimen of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
FEMAIL celebrity stylist Luke Armitage says: "I think big hats and beach bags will be on the market next summer, and since the designer has created such a stir with his work, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories".
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue their tradition of brilliant education, which was confirmed again in 2018: outstanding results in the exams have demonstrated individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other socially important disciplines.
These schools are members of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and they have over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, and they aim to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, and the status of world citizens.
As part of the education sector that is responsible for developing and implementing individual school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, you're calling to their mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you are turning to his heart.
This is a convincing proof that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with the citizens of other countries.
And from the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages are leading the league table and have the highest score in the test scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high grade of A.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin (a Chinese language), while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received A.
This proves that in Scotland's independent schools, foreign languages are undoubtedly vital for children and young people in the future.
Nowadays, language subjects are in demand as well as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employers found it difficult to fill vacancies were language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, he will gain a real advantage in the future by learning another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage  15 percent of respondents spoke it.
That's why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, there is a fairly wide distribution of languages taught in schools.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in light of the country's future development by 2020  such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff that is specialized in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland strive to create an environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
At present, there is no denying that languages remain vital to the future development of the country in the global business environment, and that this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages are really needed to be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
It must be well done.
John Edwards, Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fan's longing to see LeBron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he's still got to figure out how much time he's gonna have to make up for it.
"More than one and less than forty-eight", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudeley, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason games on the Lakers' schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the season", the player replies.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting the wave of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his nomination for chief justice was postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at 7:00 p.m. eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at a hearing this week on the nomination of his nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for the position of chief justice, a move that has generated a lot of negative reaction as Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault and the vote, which was due to take place in the Senate, will be delayed by up to a week until the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans running for office in November to boost the election momentum.
President Trump's campaign is thus aimed at helping to "activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their Senate and House majority", Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible as we enter a hectic campaign season", a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event could draw fans from ...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump's visit to West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit to the state in a month, as he gained more than 40 percent of the state's 2016 vote.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is running out of votes.
The fact that Morrissey has to come in for the president to get ahead of his competition in the polls is a bad sign for Morrissey himself says Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University (Reuters quote).
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight and feeds hope by heading to paired competition on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game was probably just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transitional initiative is an exceptionally fictitious sports concept, but it is what players believe in, and it is particularly expressed in such competitions.
So who's in charge?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so I guess it's a small initiative for us", Jordan Spit said as he left.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead, and a further 12 points on the line.
Americans, according to Spit, feel the wind in the sails, and they have reasons to keep their spirits high, not least because of Spit and Justin Thomas's form, which they played together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleep was unyielding from the tip of his tongue, as a personal example.
The victory shouts got louder as his round continued, pushing the deciding ball into the pitch, closing the game when they and Thomas gave up two-by-two.
His strike, which gave them a win in the 15th hole, was met with similar applause, one that speaks of his belief in a chance for the American team.
You have to put all your might together and focus on your game,  commented Spit.
That's all the players have left.
You can go 18 moons and win.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly made the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four out of four, and they don't seem to know how to make mistakes.
The Mollivuds were the only couple not to have a goddess on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided goddesses on a Saturday morning, a Friday afternoon, and again a Friday morning.
This series and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the angry fans, reinforces the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun shines behind the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player to secure Europe's potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both on different lanes at the same time.
However, it is too early to speak of Europe's glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly settled with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggs and two double gods on the first nine moons dug a Spanish and Swedish pit, from which they never got out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball and four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange and they deliberately keep quiet, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far Europe has played better as a team, and has come out stronger on the last day, but this quarter-final session also showed that the US team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup , Europe leads 10-6 .
Europe will gain a tangible lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the Saturday match in four-ball, quarter-finals with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two wins over wrestler Tiger Woods to bring the score to four in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, seeking to recover the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltin, dominated the American team's mistakes in the morning games by four goals, winning 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they failed to close the gap.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from 12 games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Mollywood after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed by four balls, they then teamed up to beat the spirited Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCabmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he has lost 19 of 29 matches to four goals, and four to seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the quarter, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and enjoyable daytime hike southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas earned two points on Saturday to become the American benchmark.
They won decisively with a 2/1 score over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Polter and Rory MacIlroy 4/3 in the quarter, losing the first two laps.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have the team come out of a four-point gap, coming out alone, considering that the team of Ferrick, as hosts, had to play a draw to retain the trophy.
However, after two days of second place, the Sunday counterattack looks like it's beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are increasing distrust of the United States and that his country will under no circumstances unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "essential goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear testing site, and a commitment not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles and develop nuclear technology.
But we're not seeing a symmetrical reaction from the US, he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally be the first to take action on disarmament.
While Ri repeated the North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "stage-by-stage" approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral, uncontrolled denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; Kim promised to start a movement toward "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearization must be done first, and is increasing pressure through sanctions to force its goal and even opposes declaring the war over, says Ri.
The idea that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are increasing our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If this issue of denuclearization was the side of South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a dead end".
However, Ri's tone was markedly different from last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile targeting the US was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much more had to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms itself.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't set any time limits for the process: "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions should continue actively and compulsorily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the backdrop of the UN General Assembly summit and said after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second high-level meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of his visit, North Korea condemned him for his "bandit" demands.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was talking about were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to relax in special courses
A new course introduced this year at Harvard University has helped all elementary school students learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine intake to stay awake at night.
One academic found that the world's most successful students often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a clinical specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was inspired to introduce this course by giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'I'm sorry I didn't know about this until now, when I'm almost finished.'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered to students this year, discusses how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and athletic performance, and how it improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Health Services, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was discovered that students experienced severe sleep deprivation during the academic week.
The class lasts one hour, and students complete a number of interactive tasks.
One of the classes offers a picture of a bedroom where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, exercisers, and books, get information about how each of these actions and substances  coffee, the light that causes sleep deprivation  affect sports outcomes, and how important it is to get enough sleep each day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages the participants to reflect on their daily lives.
We understand that these classes will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as anyone else has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health, Professor Chesler added.
He said the false sense of pride in being able to "stink all night" is still common, and modern technology, along with the increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He says that enough quality sleep is a student's secret weapon to fight stress, nervousness and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, because lack of sleep translates the brain into starvation, making it feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop the course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread the word around campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to go through a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students set an alarm to warn them to go to bed and wake up, and to remember the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LEDs that disrupt the human biorhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Meng to win over Gerrard
The Rangers survived another sad away meeting as Dolly Meng's goal led the untied Steven Gerrard team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Aybrokses hoped to secure their first away win after a 4:1 victory in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's side only beat Gerard for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind, giving a light win to the Harts, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their temper, didn't seem to be going to level the playing field.
While the Rangers were now down to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, and only gave up to the Hibernates in goals ratio.
And Rangers could have additional problems after linear judge Calum Spence had to heal a head wound after an item was thrown from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for the team that went through to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, followed the same strategy of the Livi 11, which increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-adjusted lineup squeeze in on the opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have been the first to own the sword, but Livingston pushed it much harder when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes when the first pass by Meng to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the halfback took the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs hit a penalty shot to team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Litgow, only managed to send the ball away.
The Rangers took over, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he should have hit a penalty kick at 45 minutes when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers only made two strokes in the first half, but former Aybrokse goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned about Lassan Kuliballi's head hit and Ovie Aguirre's weak hit.
Although Livy's first goal in the 34th minute may not have been a match, no one can deny that they earned it solely by their own efforts.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' play from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying hard to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard started acting in the break when he changed the Coulibals to Ryan Kent, and the change came almost immediately when the quarterback gave Morelos a pass, but the impressive Kelly was running off his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into their planned game with the participation of Litgow and Halkett, continuously making long transmissions.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgow gave up the corner.
Rangers backup Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity  an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter also became a staple of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Coronado Bell, starring cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the seemingly unlike scientists in the lead roles:
Man: What kind of thing is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms generated by the radioactivity in minerals.
I can hear you right now.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see abnormal cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the cure for the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and alter them in laboratory conditions .
As a result of this change, the cells get the ability to see the type of protein that is typical of many cancers, and then the cells have to be re-identified.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One patient who received this vaccine and whose immune system learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer, has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells and changing them in a laboratory setting, after which the modified cells can see the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then the modified cells are re-inserted into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says, "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine".
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar method has been successfully used in the treatment of leukemia, including fencing the immune cells of patients and teaching them how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It went badly.
Kanye West was interviewed in the studio during a concert on Saturday, where he spoke out in defense of US President Donald Trump, claiming he would take the position again in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost City", he put on the hat "Make America Great Again", and gave a speech against Democrats and supported Trump.
I talk to white people a lot, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", the singer said.
SNL made a parody show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blaisey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
The TV show didn't show the crowd getting angry at West's remarks, but the video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West by taking this step.
Besides, West complained to the audience that his hat was being ridiculed behind the scenes.
They were joking about me on stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really kidding me!
The Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, "They also said my position was not cool".
West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Wear Superman's coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.
His comments caught the attention of the audience at least twice, the cast members of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication: "The whole studio was in silence".
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest people:
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just who he was, and that's absolutely amazing.
However, I do not want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his work) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us, she said.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now officially known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddie, also known as Puff Daddie, Puffy and Pi Diddie.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lion, and as another example, of course, we can cite the recently legendary performer, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the name of the artist previously known as Prince (Prince).
Attempted murder for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a visitor died of a knife wound at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihacamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast International Court of Justice on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Star of the Game of Thrones Keith Harington attacks a toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO horror fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, recently, the 31-year-old actor has been a vocal critic of the macho-hero stereotype, saying that such characters often instill in young people the idea that to be respected, you have to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something went wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his fellow Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, a teenager, admits he is very indifferent to the issue.
I take this question quite seriously: where have we gone wrong with our perception of masculinity?,  asks the actor.
Why do we teach our teenagers that we have this problem today?
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge in toxic masculinity because of the overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it that is taught on television and on the streets that makes young men feel that they should only display one particular aspect of masculinity?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because with young people today, there's really something wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to the series after the series ends next summer, stating that he had "put an end to the battalions and horses".
From November, Keith will play the lead role in the newly filmed True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of the film's producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best ending to Game of Thrones for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future", says the actor.
Rose played the passion of Keith John Snow's character, the Emmys-winning Fantastic Series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at their family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases of the disease were sexually transmitted, indicating a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China through transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections by this means has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of adequate protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak was the fault of Republican Party senators, complaining of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected the accusation that one of her employees posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the lawsuits were forged by far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more vile lies", Waters says on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual harassment charges filed against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanagh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to the Waters office, and released information about Waters employees, Hill reports.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false,  Waters assures.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is a complete lie.
Waters' statement immediately drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
It's a furious denial, Fletcher writes.
It means the author has a temperament that is not suitable for Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself.
And you shouldn't dig into the motives of the prosecutors either.
We need to stay calm and cool.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to a Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the seat of Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
If it's true, it's very important, he writes.
In her statement, Waters says her office has warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about the fraudulent activity.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are found, she writes, and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to everyone and every one of my employees.
Johnny English is hitting a weak parody on spy Rowan Atkinson again.
Today, it's a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that features Britain in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise of Agent Johnny English, which began production in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: Reboot.
Will the self-ironic, self-motivated picture make it obvious that we're all a shit-up new attempt at national export?
Anyway, the full-eyed prof Johnny English with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time  this is his name most clearly hinting that he is a wide-screen comedy work intended for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of glamorous smoothing, got a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits and a portion of that guy who contributed one single note to the tune of Chariots of Fire in London at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, this character was created based on the identity of a traveler and the mysterious international Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind a complete chaos.
There's one or two pleasant moments in this latest edition of JE.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the shovels were climbing down his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift for performing comedy, but humor itself seems rather weak and oddly unnecessary, especially because serious film trials like Agent 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an element.
I feel that humor is for children, not adults, and I find Johnny English's bizarre misadventures not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a security guard, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately got an episode role.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, a hard-working and hard-working figure who is already suffering from a huge political underappreciation: Emma Thompson is doing her best for the quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she'll have to get someone out of the job.
And here on stage is the clumsy Johnny English himself, who is now a school teacher at some point-of-care institution, but also gives informal lessons in secret operations: here are some good jokes, because English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of rock.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reconnects with his former unlucky buddy, Buff, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, subordinate to the commander of a submarine, playing the role of a cheerful hockey goose, in which Vicki Pepperdine loses a little bit.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because of a terrible mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, they're facing the beautiful, fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova as Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously ensnared by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems  the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxurious yacht of the Volta; English generates a complete anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are a sweet and fancy fabrication, but there's something very childish about all of them.
It's a very moderate thing.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies they're working on a plan to cut the British work week to four days for five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that British people will work four days a week but get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers the savings they've made from the AI revolution, giving them extra time off.
It would allow employees to enjoy three days off for the same salary.
The sources said the idea was part of the party's economic agenda and would help the country's population to side with the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions has approved a shift to a four-day workweek so workers can take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week  is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in favour of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used a Labour conference last week to articulate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the shady directors and speculators of utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current waterway shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make a 'calculation' based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the private sector firms' capital to workers who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk for 60 minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment as chief justice for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could motivate any Republican senator to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelly interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham to see if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, of course", Kennedy said.
I went to the courthouse and told him I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information came out, I said, "Did you do this?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unambiguous.
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained unchanged.
"I'm firmly committed to Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are powerfully comparable to dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know for sure: Brett firmly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaisey Ford.
None of the witnesses she called could confirm these facts either.
This story's been going on for 36 years.
And I didn't notice anything new about it.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York City is an annual musical event featuring an impressive star cast with an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival is gathering tens of thousands of people on the large lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to share the event's true purpose: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of a global project to fight poverty, which is being carried out by an international human rights group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (if you're not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or email a world leader, make a phone call, or do any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12 year World Citizens' Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert attendance really to convince citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of what's called "clichéism" when people believe they're making real changes by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen's organizers say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters, which pursue many different goals.
World leaders have pledged to allocate more than $37 billion to help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided have directly helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to helping children reach their full potential has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about undernourishment a historic thing, Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Allman said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the 'Food Power' project, which will reach 5 million women and children through measures aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website: Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global citizen's organizers say: "It's going to be a long, hard road, and we're going to stumble and fall from time to time.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monnet -- here are some of the artists that will perform at this year's event in New York City, and it will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinka argues that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy the way they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe", he says.
And according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, together with our fleet, has the ability to ensure the open sea and, if necessary, blockade their energy supply to the market", the minister says.
Zinka addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He then compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
Iran and Russia's economic strategy is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,  says the minister, calling Russia a pony with one trick whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements came as the Trump administration set a goal of increasing its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "North Stream 2" that Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project North stream-2, which should double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, led by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), have urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"When a third country interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will be closely considering the possibility of running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for reelection.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's what women need at the top", says Warren The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll be considering running for president.
Warren put President Donald Trump's actions at the meeting: "It's going to lead this county in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump himself and his nominee for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we can vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most voters don't think Warren herself should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Research, 58 percent of the "likely" Massachusetts voters said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The poll found that the population is more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent support his possible election participation, and 48 percent oppose.
Other well-known Democratic names that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims he will make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about Trac Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's constituents
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the Army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experiences as other family members who are suffering from PTSD and who have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries", she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "blame in the face" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They are already returning with other hard-core ones, wondering if their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military personnel are being treated with the same respect they have shown their country".
Track Pailin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, the District of Columbia, support the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims of domestic violence or flight.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and counties filed a court adviser's analytical memo in Washington on Friday about support for an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The plaintiff's full name in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband and his sons, who are members of a criminal gang, abused her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala are making large claims to asylum in the United States as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Rusin, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such a ban violates this principle,  the court counsel said.
Lawyers also argue that immigration bans are damaging the U.S. economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic or gang violence.
Asylum will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief, Sachns said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pal: deaths are doubling in search of survivors
The situation was getting more and more difficult for the survivors.
"It's very difficult now", says the 35-year-old mother of Reza Kusum, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palau.
Every minute, the ambulance is bringing in the wounded.
Clean water is in great scarcity.
Residents are returning to their destroyed homes, digging in wet stuff and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake are overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near the Palau Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to the ongoing strong tremors.
He cries as he remembers how a powerful earthquake destroyed the room he was shooting with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
There was no time to save.
I think I was crushed into the rubble of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're safe and all right now.
US Ambassador blames China for attacks carried out through propaganda
A week after one of China's official newspapers published a four-page ad in a daily American edition that described the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited the Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper, as a pay supplement, accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election confirms a fact that US officials told Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, which has led to them equalizing tariffs on their countries' imports.
China's response to tariffs at the beginning of the trade war was designed to shock exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday Des Moines Register, is now doubling the amount of waste by placing propaganda in our own free press.
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press, which we cherish, by paying for and posting ads in the Des Moines Register,  writes Branstad.
However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you're unlikely to hear dissenting voices and not see the true diversity of opinions that Chinese people might have when they learn about China's alarming economic policies, because the local media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party,he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers, lovko, had declined to publish his article, although he did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: Republicans are pushing women voters out of the midterm with the Kawano vote
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that could affect the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about the situation have been heating up to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared they want to continue voting.
You can't go back to that stuff later, says Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in his article published Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow, they won't forget it in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is ahead!" in front of the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasie Ford, reports Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the limits,  said on the news website, non-partisan political scientist Steve Rothenberg.
People say the situation has already gotten pretty bad, and that's true.
But things can get worse, especially for suburban female voters and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while disliking the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Court nominee, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts speculated that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could provoke a backlash.
"This is already a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reports.
It's not just about voting in the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench, but how Republicans handle it, how they treat it, says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to trust anyway, Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more inclined toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is true or likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh is true or likely.
Additionally, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh was more likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is to gain global dominance.
We have to do it now, he says about his startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own personal online data warehouses or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, business, as well as a calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools for data processing.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify  you can use everything in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that it is fully user-controlled, which can access any information you need.
The company calls this principle the "personal expansion of rights and opportunities through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes, and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several full-time developers who have signed contracts to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make radical changes that would change all their business models completely overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet", says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a churchwarden, awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Bellenglish and Leucur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had received Britain's highest military award.
The monument was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was very symbolic that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette dated September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Canton in a very thick fog and under the fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later he jumped on the line of fire and with the greatest courage led the group forward, and then with one hand he threw a field gun, knocking down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918  just over a month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said he's unlikely to have done so heroically, but it's humbling.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the end of the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor for him to take part in the parade and added that the true hero's bravery is confirmed by the support that many people will provide.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they showed them Peppa Pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206 but you weren't allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six of the main program, and the fighting was broadcast live all night on UK television channel 5.
At 6am, as Geogard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, UK fans were stunned to see Peppa Pig on the screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all, for they stayed up until the morning to watch the fight.
One Twitter fan called the change to a children's cartoon a sick joke.
There was a government order that the content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming,  said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why this happened.
Yes, Peppa Pig.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they plan to schedule the fight so that the UK viewers can also watch it in the future.
"As for the repeat, I think we can solve this issue", says Cocker.
But it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't solve this until Sunday, which is Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there were a lot of text messages coming out, and they were all far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, thinking it was some kind of technical flaw.
Turns out it wasn't, it was a matter of state importance.
I promise you, next time, it won't happen.
We're going to cut the number of fights down to five instead of six, like we usually do, and for the fans, we're trying to increase that number, but it's overkill.
Yeah, it didn't work out.
Tom Daly felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that everyone was like him until he was in high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that winning the Olympics became less of a concern to him after he had a child.
The longtime host of Kirsty Young's show took a few months off due to illness.
Daly, who was the main guest on Laverne, said he felt "more inferior than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: "Until now, these feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy were quite real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.
He wanted to prove he meant something so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "got a little bit of a shock".
Last year, Daly married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
If so much is going on in your life at such a young age, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find a peer who would have the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son, who they named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that his whole worldview had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about me winning a gold medal", says the athlete.
But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daly said his father didn't want to accept his dying, and one of his last requests was first-row tickets to the London 2012 Games.
I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you're not gonna be around anymore, and you can't sit there in the front row", says Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", says the athlete.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of my whole life" "diving in front of a crowd of my compatriots at the Olympics", he says, "was the best feeling I've ever had".
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song  Proud by Heather Small  which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still appeals to him.

Mickelson, who's not in uniform, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to pull up his uniform to avoid a nasty setback.
Mickelson, who played in a record 12th Biennale, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for four goals and four assists.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time major winner split his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what was troubling him.
Never having the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be in the ninth match on Sunday against the eventual British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a quick start, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Ferich expressed confidence in his partner, though what else could he say.
"He fully understood the role he was assigned to play today, he patted me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Ferich.
He's pretty confident about himself.
He's a Hall of Fame walk-on, and he's done so much for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fold's record for most Ryder Cup games.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched his individual record highs.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferix said his presence was of great benefit to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to get people off, and he's a great guy to be interested in, he explained.
I think this week the young players had a lot of fun with him, and it was interesting to watch.
His game is much more than just a game.
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead in the singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn against you.
The Danish made his debut in a match in 1997 at Valderram, where the team, led by Severyano Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only got a little ahead of the finish line with the slightest difference, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage at Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost and at Walderram where we won, but only recently", said Bjorn, captured in the photo, after watching the Class of 2018, winning at Le Golf National 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, giving the score a 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that this is not the end.
You'll be on the full list tomorrow.
Go and do it right.
Until the glasses are put on the board, nothing's done.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I've been talking about the 12 players on our team, but we know what we're up against against against the greatest players in the world.
Pleased with the way his players played on a golf course that was uncomfortable for them, Bjorn added: "I would never outdo myself in this.
We're going to have another trial tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're having a solo show, which is a whole different story.
It's always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're just trying your best as a professional golfer.
That's the kind of thought you have to instill in your players to be able to play tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind, and he must do his best too.
Unlike Björn, his rival, Jim Ferich, believes that his players will perform better individually than their partners, except for Jordan Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferix himself went through this whole carousel of the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the "Miracle in Medina".
I remember every damn word about it, he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought his players together before the last day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it as fast as you can in Brooklyn, as you can in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We've got our game plan right and we've got the guys right, you know?
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory MacIlroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
"I picked this group of guys, and in that order, because I think that's how they're going to cover all the possible shortcomings", Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of the new German warship is postponed
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but this will not happen next year at least because of faulty systems and avalanche-like cost increases, local media report.
The launch of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the main ship of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a variety of anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, and some stels technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods  the possibility of deploying the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant delay in commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to expand its power abroad, will be outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidental F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of critical programming and hardware defects that rendered the warship useless in combat.
The software shortcomings were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors  only half the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to implement upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of anchoring the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peters Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was effectively running out of deployable ships.
The official said the problem had grown worse over time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no ships were given to replace them.
He maintained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could be taken up by the navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in one of the Scottish Highlands' estates, aims to show how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the data will give a fresh perspective on the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help in the future conservation efforts.
The study, organised by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will examine the common notturbo, the soprano notturbo, as well as the brown long-haired Dobanton bats and night-birds that inhabit Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at certain points around the site to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the screams and the types of activities that the various groups of these animals are responsible for.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dwyer, NTS's conservation advisor, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the main areas of environmental management, such as the formation of meadows, and ways to maintain forest ranges in a state that is optimal for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can pose dangers, as can fly adhesive tape, chemical treatment of building materials, and domestic cat hunting.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat population issues very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who conduct surveys, field trials, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, a great place for bats", he says.
There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good environment.
But there's still a lot that's unknown about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It reminds us of the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance on private property, as accidental destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, and their destruction, harvesting or destruction of their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation officer, is calling on the public to help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many different species live".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape, calling them fake news and claiming that people are just trying to make a name for themselves using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Špigel, which published the charges against the footballer.
The forward from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga, allegedly in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to tell her about the incident, Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram that the footballer has 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were announced, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information fake news.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they've been telling us today is all fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They just want to make a name for themselves using my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
I'm a happy person, and I'm doing great, adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for charges they called "unconvincing information about suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player intends to claim damages for the moral damage of the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident is alleged to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Major says that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her he was a 99 percent good guy, but he was a one percent good guy.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and that the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt she was being avenged and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to move now because she continues to experience the traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was due to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he was transferred to Italian giants Juventus in a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain regrets carmakers lost forever
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark has said that Britain will regret this forever if it loses its status as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
We need a deal, Mr. Clark says.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of the delay at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The plant in Bernstone produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped", says Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Bernstone.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to carmakers, in the absence of a Brexit deal, the supply chain will be put at great risk.
Toyota's production line is launched on time, and parts for custom cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, the border could break down, which industry officials say could lead to delays and spare parts shortages.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store supplies at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU, announced in Checker's, was calibrated enough to avoid these border checks.
"We need a deal. We want to make a better deal that will allow, I repeat, not only to be successful now but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers say we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains
Toyota could not specify for what period production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsvalllaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is the union's head, says the concern among the organization's members is growing: "In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can't get them back".
A government spokesman says: 'We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed another week as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for chief justice continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential presidential obstructions to justice.
Whether Trump will remove the deputy attorney general from office, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a source of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wires to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeachment of the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blaisey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints about Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week given all the other events taking place in the Supreme Court".
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders hasn't held a White House briefing since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings is not caused by the "social media bias" of television reporters, though she added: "I will not deny that they are playing for publicity".
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
The president holds more meetings, answering questions from journalists than any other president before him, she added, without giving any exact figures:We have these figures.
Sanders assured me that the briefings would continue, but if the press had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions from outside the White House, attending open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The president's frivolous, sometimes bizarre behavior in front of reporters gathered in New York this week may be the answer to why.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter about concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed the EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country's heritage and to wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote this letter to the staff less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applying for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal have continued, and this fall an expected decision is due.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
So right now, I want to stress once again how much I value the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury .
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
"He went out to the side of the line and just collapsed there", said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of the line before putting him on the carrier and taking him for medical examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/degree of injury yet, and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who had just entered the sophomore year, this was his first season as a member of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which totaled 18 for the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher landmark fee when buying real estate in the UK.
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher landmark fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the additional money raised will be used to help the homeless.
This move will nullify Corbin 's efforts to attract young voters .
The increased flag fee will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher landmark fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
This move will derail Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more affordable and increase citizens' incomes.
The increase in the coat of arms will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds raised should stimulate government efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge to the existing coat of arms, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London properties are bought by non-British residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy their first home to improve their living conditions later.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of undercutting property prices by buying land but not actually using it, and urged Ms. May to waive quotas on affordable housing to rectify the shameful housing situation in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include controlling rent and ending unreasonable evictions.
He also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I had dedicated my premiership to the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
And that, in turn, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that for non-British citizens and foreign companies, real estate is as accessible as hardworking Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is far too far away, and the threat of being outdoors is too real for some.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman enjoys the revival of the North East club, which currently sits third in the Premier League, three points clear of the Championship.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's it, Ross Sportsound told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching as a child with my father over Scotland in Hampden, and it always drew me back.
But that's only possible if I can be a successful manager.
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not afraid of such reputable names at such big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
The club is undoubtedly in the Premier League by structure and capabilities, says the coach.
To get him out there is a tough task, but I will consider myself successful only if I can get the club back.
Ross was a manager for only three years, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third tier and the following season led St Mirren from the bottom to the championship winners.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
I honestly believed that management was more for me than a game.
It sounds weird, because I did everything right, I made a good living in this position, and I got some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still stressed out, stressed out at work, but I feel good as a manager.
I always wanted to lead, and now doing so, I feel most comfortable, like a fish in the water, in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, on Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 English time.

The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, while restaurants fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consulting firm CGA, which obtained the statistics, says: "The prolonged sunshine activity, as well as the longer-term than expected, of England's participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when pub sales increased by 2.8%, and restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly".
The June drop in restaurant sales of 1.8% continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol performed much better than restaurants.
Food-only pubs were also hit by the heat of the sun, though not as badly as restaurants.
It's like people want to go out just to miss a glass.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% in a month, and food sales by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, says: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
It is no wonder that restaurant chains continue to struggle, especially as a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year will be particularly painful because of continued price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved to be unprecedented for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, will provide much needed rest.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brands' downturn.
Coffer Peach Tracker's industry sales monitoring of the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 networks with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.

Twenty percent of the students said they had a primary account that their parents knew about.
However, one in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake accounts inst  i.e. Instagram, a photo sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic, clean account that their parents have access to, but also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, came across a teenager who was urging others to rape him.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Principals (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one is generally classified.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are looking to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and this is a worrying fact".
Elid Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish athletics team.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete in track and field, and Chairman Ian Beattie says the move is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from the athlete's extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elyde is highly respected in the Scottish, British and international athletics community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland", says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I am striving to be a voice for athletes, and I hope to be able to make a real contribution to the development of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator for the BBC, having lost the ability to walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and if so, how much.
It was a tiring job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I'm doing some skill exercises today!
Thank you so much for your support!
A milkshake ad that compared nursing mothers to cows has divided the opinions of Internet users
A dairy company has sparked controversy online by posting an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to dairy cows.
Releasing what is said to be the world's first breast-wearable silent milk soap, consumer technology company Elvie has released a promotional music video that demonstrates the freedom the new milk soap offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms are dancing in a haystack to a music track that says, "Yeah, I'm feeding my own milk, but you can't see my tail".
And then the choir: "We're breastfeeding, we're breastfeeding, we're breastfeeding, we're breastfeeding, we're breastfeeding".
This video, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received mixed reviews from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within days of their birth, writes one user.
Elvie milk suction is directly dressed under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: It's obviously equally traumatic for mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk suction for mothers who leave their children behind?"
Another user adds: Advertising cut off from reality.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding a baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, of course, but that's pretty much how it feels.
A brilliant product, written by one user.
And another comment: A cool ad for moms who are breastfeeding (often they do it right at their workplaces or in the bathroom), and who, in fact, feel a little bit like cows.
This ad is not meant to praise or curse our dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women shows them all dancing with these unseen milkshakes hidden under their braces.
The concept of this ad campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk suction is completely unfeasible, has no wires or tubes, fits freely into the breastplate for feeding, and is unnoticed, allowing women to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early child development specialist at Mother, comments: "Elvie Milk Suckers is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative publicity.
By making a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring breastfeeding and all of its problems to the forefront, while showing in a humorous and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that new milk suction gives.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk sucker has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Yakubovskaya, using this product for her purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border unhindered
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policies made it difficult to place children under guardianship.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear putting their stay in the country at risk by taking a child under their custody.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to be taken into custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
About 80 percent of the people who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
So we're continuing to pursue these individuals, Albanes said.
According to the shelter, in an effort to speed up the process of enrolling children, officials have introduced new rules that some of them must appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days as before.
Many of them are present via video rather than in person to declare their legal status as immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported promptly.
According to shelter staff and information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer children stay in prison, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these problems are intensifying in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs of a child experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them emotional time to prepare or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for eight years.
Mu'allim, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally", he told the crowd.
Muallem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus will continue to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who mostly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Muallem said that good conditions were created for their return, and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that encouraged refugees to stay outside the country.
We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help bring the citizens back, he says.
They're politicizing what should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped in the reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has opened up an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had a clear deadline and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, will be convened soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's work should be limited to "examination of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency prematurely, which is probably what many liberal audiences hope.
And this will undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale in history!
There's no sign of the audience being tired at this point.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has surpassed cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers on the screens in the evenings during the mainstream news show.
"This is the fire that people crave because it's beyond our grasp", says Neil Baer, director of ABC drama "The Named Survivor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scowell, long-published comedy writer and author It's funny: a few unpleasant truths about infiltrating the Hollywood Boys Club offers a different theory.
She remembers once driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Yes, because he's funny!"
There's something valuable about all this chaos, it's fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content on television, the storylines of Washington's events can shape the future of Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, for the sixth hour in a row, when you watch a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of deep background for his book Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 strawberry jacket (a garment warm with pride, as the Washington Post writes), or the stark description of Stormy Daniels, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it's already beyond ordinary awareness.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
Part of his job is to make us feel like the reality show is feeding you something every night  says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns of the story (a N.F.L. dragon, a tribute to Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees north of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't get off the screen, at least not exactly when they show Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", says Mr. Fleiss.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Outsider money pouring into the most brutal midterm elections the White House has ever held.
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is getting cash flow from a change in congressional districts where two officials are in the race for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh suburb, whose geography has recently been changed, is backed by Democrat House member Connor Lamb, who won another district seat in the special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which essentially intersects with the new 17.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were being framed by Republicans in violation of the constitution as a result of pre-election machinations.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate about campaign financing between the main party's financial forces  Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small margin in the widely watched March special election to Congress in Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The Republican has held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points ahead.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight edge.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which provoked a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelo, who also owned the property in Panama until his partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to conclude a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, effectively ending the discussion of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it to signal that the administration is giving this meeting a real importance.
Three U.S. diplomats returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was told by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst from the administration, but they also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn about history
The next step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is currently well documented in public reports.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating the existence of a conspiracy by Trump's campaign against Russia and its attacks during the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to a jury of his peers.
But there's a lot of "ifs"; I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is the downfall of his counterparts in Europe.
We're all gonna make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
But we didn't, and we missed the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds at these very points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are going through some of these turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the paper, he offered to make secret records last year about the president's activities and discussed his unsuitability for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times's data is incorrect.
What would we do if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh was not complete or true, or if he was still confirmed as chief justice despite credible sexual harassment charges and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe we can pass them well thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she took me lighting Saturday candles on a table with the symbol swastika.
With a family history like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of Last Palace: Europe's Troubling Age in the History of Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the upcoming match against the Vienna Rapids.
The Rangers will host the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take a strong position in the Europa League's G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first ever goalless appearance of the season with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this as a springboard to achieve great results.
"It was a good moment for us because 'Villarreal' is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We entered the game thinking we could get something, and we left with no one.
Maybe we could have made it in the end, but overall, none of it was likely a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half where we showed better.
There's another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, considering all the injuries I've had and the club's own replacements, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly chosen, and the kids really enjoy it; they've been training for a while.
I hope we can move forward, put last season behind us and make it work.
Women are losing sleep because of fear of their retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about the subject.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't try to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children about how you can prepare your family for the fact that they will likely have to care for you if you do not give them your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where you will receive medical care, as this can be a major cost factor.
Consult your financial advisor, who can help you to develop a plan for paying for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help you cover these expenses or insure yourself with your own property provided you have money.
Get your legal papers in order: get rid of legal battles.
Write up a healthcare certificate and appoint a trusted person to monitor your healthcare and ensure that the specialists fulfill your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that you consider making a financial trust.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor your bills if you become incapacitated.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Because of the communications failure, rescuers cannot get any information from Donggala, a district north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In Palos, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggala, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people (2017 data).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county that extends along 300 km (180 mi) of the coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, the administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and in particular, the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important to the province's economy, but is mostly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has devastated Pala and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily left in ruins.
Sarah Palin 's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Pailin, 29, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence situation, and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in Mat-Su detention center and will be released on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his "clear innocence".
Payline is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B felony punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in the earthquake on Sulawesi island in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media is showing up videos of the incident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palú when the tsunami struck the shore.
The federal prosecutor 's office wants to hand down a rare death sentence to a suspect in a New York terror attack .
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bike path on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight people and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to carry out the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court filing, both charges could lead to a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury read Saipo's 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of racketeering murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of assault and vehicular destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "carefully planned and deliberate", and Saipov carried it out in what is described as "abhorrent, brutal and criminal" manner.
Saipov has injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decadata, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Ernana Ferruchi, Ernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuckko,  said in the notice of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty for a crime.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching a video of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He denies all 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who sided with Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that a decision to use the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only aggravate the pain of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Naijil Farage should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Faraj swore to mobilize the People's Army.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the urge of eurosceptics, as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone told a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have left by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is exacerbated by the fact that Tory party members opposed to leaving the EU are joining a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, announced in Checker's midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Boone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wants to beat the Checkers.
He proposed that Mr. Faraj be leveled and put in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
If he was responsible, we'd be out by now, he said.
MP Wellingboro added: "I will continue to support Brexit, but we need to beat the Chequers".
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our laws in our country.
Mr Boone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, commenting to journalists: "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people".
Checker's unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he's unpopular with our party members and our activists who are actually taking to the streets and voting for us first.
Please put the Checker's aside and start listening to what they're telling you.
In her sharp address to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers stay in their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they need to be made to feel guilty.
"It's now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class", he says.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, we're not going to let you down.
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel the sting.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration in Birmingham, followed by a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists have been waving banners of "Tory against Brexit" this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party's mobile app.
And these people claim they can configure the IT systems and technologies of Canada plus plus, to work across borders, to trade freely without borders with Ireland, he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit in principle, he says.
Warren plans to thoroughly study the possibility of running for president.
U.S. Congresswoman Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will be carefully considering the possibility of running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's talk that she has a chance to run for President Trump in 2020.
She held another election meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon; it was her 36th election meeting in the city hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that it would take a woman upstairs.
As a result of the murder of Sims (shot), an LSU player was arrested.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which occurred on Friday, has been arrested.
At 11:00 a.m. local time at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting asking for help identifying the person who was caught on video.
20-year-old Sims was shot near the South campus Friday morning.
Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death, Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade got involved with his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a weapon and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 1 m 82 cm tall young man grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaching the title of world champion after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a big role in the race.
Bottas was already starting well from pole position and practically hung up on Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettle was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton behind behind the rest of the group.
Mercedes went to the pit stop one lap later, and then got out behind Fettell, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, broke forward, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior space free, risking to get stuck after a double move to protect in the third lap.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then spent most of the race on his home tyres, with the goal of finishing fast, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually went to the pit stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, as Rykkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Walter did a fantastic job on the weekends and he showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a few tricks in stock", Hamilton said.
The Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dayan Feinstein at a voter meeting on Saturday for her claim that she did not publish a letter from Christina Blaisey Ford accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were "screwd, ugly and lying people".
The only possible reaction to all this, and what's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, anger, anger, disgust and lies, he said.
You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get any information?
Remember her answer... you sent the information on the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't spill.
All right, stop it.
Did we? No, we didn't, he added with the senator's intonation.
In July, Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, but I didn't leak her information", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.
However, the way she denied the allegations of leakage did not seem to please the president, who commented on it during a rally on Saturday: "Here's what I'm telling you: body language has failed her greatly.
She may not have been a squirrel, but body language was the worst thing I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend his Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They're definitely trying to regain power by any means they can.
We see the viciousness, the disgust, they don't care who they offend, who they must step through to gain power and control, Mediaite quotes the president.
British elite hockey league: Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee.
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dandy Stars paid for Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants, winning the replay match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of the Dandy.
The Giants had an early lead on two goals thanks to the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowie.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the home team before Dwyer led the Giants to the playoffs.
Francois Bouchar tied the score against Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For Adam Keef's men, who won the 2-1 victory over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat of the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, as the Giants had won their previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after a goal pass by Kendall MacFall with David Rutherford, after which Bowiller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the opening period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Markward helped Cooney tie the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first half when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bouchar again tied the score, scoring a goal in the numerical overlap of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dandy his first lead in the second period, after which he and his team secured the win by keeping the opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are headed to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people aboard the plane could escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously given the title of hero after he deliberately died to ensure that the plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing as a result of a strong earthquake on Sulawesi island on Friday that caused a tsunami.
Strong underground shocks continue to destroy the area, leaving many of the residents of the city of Palú under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old António Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the horribly rocking control tower of Mutiara Sisi Al Jufri airport, Palau.
He remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then when he saw the tower collapse, he jumped off it.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Syrait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the controller died before the helicopter could land in Palo.
We are very sorry for this loss, he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of people killed by the earthquake could reach thousands, as according to the Natural Disaster Relief Agency, access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is likely to rise, as a large number of people are still under the rubble and many have never been able to get out", says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres high ravaged the city of Palo, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The emergency services are bringing the victims every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
The tragedy has taken on a pretty serious scale, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, saying in particular: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by a devastating earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports one person missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports one person missing, while it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini's report said that as of Saturday afternoon, it has no information about a single male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to locate the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline also said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens says the plane is coming in at a low runway.
And that's very good, Jane adds.
Jane's said he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane because the water level was below the belt.
He also said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming on board, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped rescue the ship by using a floating boat to take people ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m) below the water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in air crashes involving PNG-registered aircraft over the past two decades, but none of these crashes were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove the woman was burned alive .
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a lawsuit against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to capture the story of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several cell phones; according to this data, Tellis was spending time with Chambers that evening, contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but his cell phone was reportedly near Chambers; when the incident was discovered, Sanford was questioned by police.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tallis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to the phone records, they only called for one week.
Rowlett also revealed that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hale says.
The defense should begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip hop trio is going to fight the negative attitude towards this genre by filling their music with positive content.
Bristol-based band The High Breed argues that the content of hip hop has changed away from the original political and social issues.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sued a couple for a racist text
A New York nanny sued a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a complaint from a woman that the nanny was more than one black woman, who the woman mistakenly sent to a nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny being racist, claiming the lawsuit was filed with the intent of extortion.
Lindsay Placebo-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family for her first day of work in 2016.
She's not, but she's still black, Mrs. Placebo-Flexman wrote her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly sent him Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her disgrace, the confused Placebo-Flexman fired Morris, stating on the service that the nanny who turned out to be African American was doing poorly at work and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African American, the New York Post reports.
Morris was paid for one day's work, then sent home on Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and demanding compensation for dismissal of $350 a day for six months  under the terms of the initial oral agreement, which, however, was not secured by any contract.
I want them to understand that these things are unacceptable, she told the Post on Friday, adding, "And I know that's discrimination.
The husbands disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that firing Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since if they offended her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
My wife texted her something she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, my husband, Joe Plasto, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude to them, without your own will?
Would you trust your newborn?
Go ahead and do it.
Calling the lawsuit a "bribery", Plasto said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
And you're willing to pursue a man who's in this situation?
Not very nice of you, said a bank employee specializing in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and logical problems.
Paddington editors feared readers would not understand the movements of the talking bear, a new letter says.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads a book for the first time before it's published.
It's funny to know Paddington is a huge success.
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator for the BBC, and would have been optimistic about refusing to publish, adding that the 60th anniversary of his books was "both joyful and bitter" since their author died last year.
As for the Paddington bear herself, she describes him as a very important member of our family, and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally become famous.
"He was a quiet and humble man", his daughter says.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father, it was almost like his own child had achieved success: he was proud of it, even though he didn't really consider it his own merit.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the product of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong", Mrs. Ednan-Lapperuz says.
Then he called again and said she was going to die within the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors gave her to make her heart work gradually stopped working and left her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I had to just sit back and wait, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, I couldn't scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, coping with the enormous loss she had just experienced.
"No one around knew what was going on", she says.
I was so upset, I couldn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this all-embracing feeling of compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking that step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with words of comfort and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to experience what I experience every day", she says.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, says her son was a great cook and had a goddamn charming smile.
Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, the room was lit.
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was going through really terrible times.
It happened in 2014, and Tyler's suicide was found by his own brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm not afraid of a chain reaction.
Mrs. Davis made these cards up so people would know that there was someone to talk to and tell everything, even if it was your friend.
You can't just sit there and shut up, you have to talk to people.
Mrs. Humphries, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, to whom she lived for 15 years.
"He didn't say he was depressed or upset or anything like that", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was particularly ill at Christmas, not even looking at the children when they opened their presents.
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it, and it shocked our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: FBI begins an investigation
I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for, a time-limited and volume-limited investigation, we could bring a little unity, Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be torn apart amid growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6, and if things go badly for the Republicans, they'll be seriously weakened in their efforts to get the man they want and elect him to the country's top judge.
George W. Bush is calling the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equal votes and confirm his candidacy for the position of Chief Justice.
North Korean refugees have declined under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Ben Seug, citing the southern ministry's data, said that compared to the 2,706 cases of flight recorded in 2011, the figure had dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park says the key factors were tightening border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers who export people.
Pyongyang is not giving public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often makes them subject to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they reached common agreements on disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yun Ho accused the United States of impeding progress on the issue with its sanctions.
"If we do not have the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to begin unilateral disarmament in any way", Mr. Ri said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he's not fit for the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like this, she would be called a 'hysterical' person", Pelosi says of her reaction to Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and choking to death, telling about his family and school years.
He also unambiguously condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and well-planned murder of an active person" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi also said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he's targeting the Clintons and Democrats", she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt were proven and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only good for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's in now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justice advocate.
At his candidacy hearings, Kavanagh ignored the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time to let a hysterical and prejudiced man take the position of chief justice and say, 'How wonderful!' " says Pelosi.
And women should own it.
It's just a rage, months and years of rage, she can't go through it without tears.
When we're angry, we cry, Miss Stein told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was a great help to a woman who worked in a management position, and she said that she cried when she was angry, too, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interlocutor, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really pissed off".
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they're misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in a male-dominated office was one day when I cried out in a rage, but I was grabbed by an old woman, a soulless manager I was always terrified of, and led to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they've finally got you.
Patricia Schrader, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Harry Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some serious plot and dropped out of the race, and Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to stop her from running for president.
This decision was not well thought out, and she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was coming to an end, and she was way behind in the fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed like a perfectly defeated option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to men, offered her only 250.
I'm a valuable commodity to them, isn't it? She was surprised.
When she made the speech announcing that she would not run the official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions  gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access to voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she choked.
You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown, Mrs. Schrader recalls the press' reaction to her.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering what they'd write on my monument.
She cried endlessly.
How can a trade war with America be beneficial to Beijing?
Experts believe that the first shocks of the US-China trade war were daunting, and while the battle is still far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation was this week, when the new tariffs hit $200 billion in goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly inflicted equivalent retaliatory strikes, recently imposing tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion ranging from five to ten percent.
China has promised that the response to the United States will be the same each time, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to experience even the slightest difficulties any time soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means giving in, but publicly giving in would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards right, the US trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic turmoil in either of these countries is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized by observers says Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, a center specializing in Asia.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and is seeking help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
Currently, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept any aid under any conditions or aid from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe has secured victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team with a final score of 16.5  10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight times on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long jump into the water on the 16th hole of the par-3, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1-x-4 players who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5:4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Turbjörn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Polter, who may have been the last Ryder Cup player.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in all of Europe's history with 25.5 points per career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the trophy again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won the 2-1 victory over American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game.
"I'm incredibly proud of this win. I grew up watching Tiger Woods play", says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3.
These numbers are pretty odd for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, beating only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend, trying vainly to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to shake Europe a little.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were excellent.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward, making progress.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be good at losing.
We lost.
Red tide: microbes are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report reflects a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, areas in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties are reported to be flowering abundantly, suggesting a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Straits stretch approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinell to southern Lee counties.
The outcrops can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they've dropped significantly over the past week.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
