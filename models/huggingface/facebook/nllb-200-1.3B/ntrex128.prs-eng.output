Members of the Welsh Parliament are concerned about being seen as Muppet.
There is some debate among MPs about the proposal to change their titles to MWPs (Members of Parliament for Wales).
This was due to plans to rename the House of Commons to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this may lead to a mockery.
A Labour MP expressed concern that the term  is rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means fool and pwp means fecal.
A lawmaker from the PILED party stated that he was not entirely happy and suggested alternative terms.
The Conservative Party of Wales stated that its party was "open minded" about the name change, but stressed that it was a short cancellation leap from MWP to MP.
In this sense, the Welsh w is the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the bill on name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what the House members refer to is naturally a matter of concern to the members themselves".
The 2017 Welsh Government Resolution gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had widespread support for the dissolving of the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title MP, the Commission wanted the title WMPs, but the MWP option had widespread support from public consultation.
Members of the House of Commons seem to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus is a headache for Speaker Ellen Janssen, who is expected to submit the proposed amendments within weeks.
The Reform Act included other changes to the way parliament works, including provisions on disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
The assembly shall give the final vote on what title to call a law when it is debated.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was planned after decades of attempts to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership efforts in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Giorgi Ivanov opposed the referendum, saying he would not mind the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayed, argue that the name change is only a cost of membership in the EU and NATO.
With the efforts of churches in Harlem, the bells of St. Martin's are ringing.
"Historically, the old men I spoke to say that there was a pub and a church around every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is none".
He said the disappearance of the pubs is understandable.
He stated that these days, "people are socializing in different ways".
"Homes are no longer the adjoining living rooms that people regularly go to".
As for churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will go back to where they started".
He added that the churches would be replaced by residential buildings with shared apartments where people would live who would not be helped by the remains of the churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white and so the day will come when all these churches will be completely blocked because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches", he said.
Both churches were built by white settlers before Harlem became a black city - the city's largest community - in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white settlers left the Methodist Church in the 1930s.
A black cow that worshipped near the building was named after it.
S.T. Martin was ousted from power by a black settler led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a retail strike on 125th Street, the main street of Harlem's retailers, opposed to the leasing or promotion of blacks.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, but Carillon was used as a venue when members of the local church decided to rebuild the building.
The Rev. David Johnson, Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly coined the term "poor man's money" for the Carolingians.
The scholar who called July Carillon called it another term: "cultural mess" and "tools without historical counterparts".
Tiffany Angie, an expert at the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first Graden carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved into a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether stated that S.T. Martin would not replace him.
What has been played out at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex narrative of architects and contractors, some introduced by non-clerical church leaders and others by the episcopal realm.
The church's boardroom - the governing body of the church, which is made up of non-clergy leaders - wrote to the church's boardroom in July, worried that the church would "pursue it to expand along the shores", even though the boardroom had no role in the leases and contracts the church's boardroom had sent them.
Some church members complained about the lack of transparency in the church's territorial division.
A shark in California injures a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while diving in a lobster barn in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamill told KSWB television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when they suddenly heard a baby crying for help, and they rushed to him with a group of divers to get him out of the water.
Hamil stated that at first she thought it was just a thrill to catch a lobster, but then she "felt the baby screaming, 'I'm the prey!'
I was preyed upon".
And all the ears of the beast were opened, and she saw that she had borne a child.
And I called to them, and said, Behold a great shark in the waters.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and placed on the critical list.
The type of shark attacking was unknown.
Sinking Rescue Guard Captain Larry Gillis told a press conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier but did not appear to be a dangerous shark.
Gillis added that the victim died from injuries to the upper hemispheres.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Punto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Escinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gillies stated that there were over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most were not considered to be endangered.
Sensboreus decides to put pressure on UK cosmetics market
Sensbore competes with Botts, SuperDrag and Debenhams by creating corridors inside a cosmetics store run by expert colleagues.
As part of a strong push into the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is growing amid falling sales of cosmetics and household goods, cosmetics aisles are being tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Investments in cosmetics are being made in a context where supermarkets are trying to use the front-end space once used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics volume for the first time with an offering of 3,000 products including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also take up more space alongside branded departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarkets are also reactivating the mini-store layout, making most products for vegetarians more convenient and increasingly sought after by novice shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fergrance is testing the licenses at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, while the second in Seeley Acre, Birmingham, is due to open later this year.
Shopping online and switching to everyday purchases of small amounts of food from local stores is easy, meaning that supermarkets must invest more effort to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Cope, CEO of SensorBoris, said stores will increasingly look like state-owned stores as supermarket chains attempt to compete against discount providers like Aldi and Lidl by offering more service and no groceries.
Sainsbury's is installing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of habitats since purchasing both chains two years ago, which it says have increased grocery sales and made the business more profitable.
Previous efforts by supermarkets to renovate the cosmetics and cosmetics departments ended in failure.
Sainsburys tried a hypothetical joint venture with Botts in early 2000, but their partnership ended after controversy over how to allocate capital from chemical stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Silesio, owner of the Lloyds chain of pharmacies, for £125 million three years ago.
He stated that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by adding an extended range of facial hygiene brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of SisenseBoris stated, "We have changed our view and feel about cosmetic aisles to make the environment better for our customers.
We also invested in our specialized trainees who are available to provide advice.
Our lineup of brands is designed to fit all needs and attractive environments, and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination for cosmetics that challenge old ways of selling".
Peter Jones's "disclosure" after Holly Willoughby's exit from an £11 million deal
The star of Dragon Day, Peter Janshaw, has become "notorious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with the household appliance brand to focus on a contract with Marks, Spencer and TV I.
Willoughby doesn't have time to brand clothes and trolley household items.
The two partners' business is similar to the Gopelinite Pallets brand.
This morning, operator 37 announced on Instagram that it was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has angered the Dragon Ball Z by stepping down from the lucrative lifestyle brand last minute to focus on her big deals with Marks & Spencer and TV I star Peter Jones.
Sources say that when the TV Golden Girl confessed during a press conference on Tuesday at the head office of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new deal - worth £1.5 million - meant she didn't have enough time to hand over the clothing and home furnishings brand to Trolley, it "made Jones feel overwhelmed".
A similar business was the Gopwyn Paltrow Company, which doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby 37 announced his departure from Trolley on Instagram, Jans left the UK to go on holiday to one of his homes.
A source stated: "So far, Trolley has been among Halley's top priorities.
This probably marked a long-term future for him that would await him in the next few decades.
He hath made all his companions to be ashamed of thee, when he is come forth.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as the Sabbath was about to begin.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlowe's head office that are ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's CEO, who is among the biggest investors in the UK, has been influenced by his massive investments in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothing and home furnishings, which could potentially cost millions of dollars and delay the launch of the business.
And it could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Don Baldwin were in a relationship with Janice and his wife Tara Kopp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cope, and Janssen, 52, joined in March.
The couple went on holiday together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is set to represent the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm a Celebrity on TV I.
"We will not comment on his business affairs", a source close to Jones said last night.
"And then we fell in love" is a phrase that comes from the Pratt-Nixton
He joked about the media criticism that some might consider it "unfit for the presidency" and his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why was President Trump so forgiving?
Trump joked that he was "the news anchor".
"I have not given up anything".
He said Kim expressed interest in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which was welcomed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Re Yang-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Monday that North Korea had not seen a "reciprocal response" from the United States to North Korea's initial efforts to disarm.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump had a very optimistic outlook in his rally speech.
He said, "We get along very well with North Korea".
"If we were at war with North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship".
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, ending rocket tests, helping to rescue hostages, and allowing the remaining American crew members to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this closed arena, we're going to have about 200 people stationed there", Trump said, referring directly to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastate island and kill hundreds
After the Lompoc earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok, a national emergency that requires accelerated international assistance has not been declared.
"Unfortunately, in most cases they have been very clear about not needing international assistance, which is a bit challenging", Ms Sambang said.
While the Child Protection Agency is organizing a team to travel to Palo, there is uncertainty whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesperson for the National Crisis Management Office, said that Indonesian officials are reviewing the situation in Palau to allow international agencies to cooperate with relief efforts.
Given the frequent earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they do not have a common visual area across the coastline.
Although there was an alert, the apparent absence of an alert beacon in Palo likely caused casualties.
At the most convenient times, travel between Indonesia and some of its islands can be challenging.
Natural crises make logistics provisioning more complex.
A floating hospital on board the ship, which was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is on its way to the south of Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on restoring the infrastructure that was destroyed, and spent the budget on roads and railways.
But the budget deficit has disrupted Mr. Joko's administration, although he is running for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko continues to face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as the majority Muslims follow traditional Traian.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced by Christian and Muslim mobs using sawed-off shotguns, bows and other light weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge scores a dramatic draw against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by a single point in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Zinedine Zidane when he was 0-1 with his team about 30 yards from the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting the goal.
The ball was thrown at a higher altitude than the penalty area and then changed its course to the right and up the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the kipa Arizaballaga that was scoring and then entered the net.
"It was just an attempt to get into the position to get the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far as they can, so I just tried to take the initiative wherever I could", Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and he hit the ball with just one call before he thought much about it".
Chelsea scored the first goal 0-1 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Edin Hazard.
In the process, the blue forward passed the ball back to Matthew Kvasik before it quickly entered Liverpool's midfield near midfield.
And Quashik took it by cunning, and ran to the midst of the field.
He then threw a direct ball that caused the ball to enter the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defence and threw the ball into the goal arch with a left foot kick as Alison Baker left Liverpool behind.
On Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, Liverpool will take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage.
On Thursday at 3pm in the UEFA Europa League, Chelsea will play against Videotron.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
According to the Crisis Management Office on Sunday morning, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
A large number of people are reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that have been shaken by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday with waves reaching up to 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sotopo Puru Novogruho said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with a population of 380,000, was destroyed by the remains of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman killed by knife
An investigation into the murder began this morning after the body of a woman was discovered in Breckinhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was discovered at 7.55am in Grayson Mews on John Road, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people of the area to testify to what they had seen or heard.
Brian O'Hagan, the investigation's investigator, said: "The investigation is in its early stages and I would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of John Road in Breckenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have captured images by a dash camera, to contact us as they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confessed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Breckinhead and was found inside a building.
And it came to pass after the morning that certain men came, who said they were friends of the woman, to inquire of the place where she had been found this morning.
According to police statements that they are informing the victim's next of kin, the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mice was returning to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he saw what had happened, he was silent.
Residents of the building were told it would take hours before they were allowed to enter.
A police officer who was speaking to a man was heard to say that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
There was another woman in the scene with tears running down her face.
"It's very terrible", he repeated.
At 2 pm, two police cars were parked, one inside the seat belt and the other outside.
A number of officers were stationed inside the security belt and were guarding the apartment blocks.
All persons with information are requested to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 111 555 0800 with the log 247 of September 30.
Tendes Karamool in Parliament is the latest monument targeted by the "rewrite history" riots
His deportation would be a just punishment in return for the Taliban's destruction of the British cultural and religious heritage by its fanatical and fundamentalist followers.
But the Cramwell Association has described Mr. Crick's proposal as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cramwell Society, commented: "In the ongoing debate over the demise of the Tandys, it was unlikely that the statue of Oliver Cramwell outside the Palace of Westminster would one day be targeted.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the destruction of the English Civil Wars.
In fact, Cramwell's mistake is that he was the victim of the actions of his predecessors, such as Thomas, in the last century.
William Hammond's glorious portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century views and part of the character historiography that most believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cramwell was probably more widely regarded as the defender of Parliament against foreign pressure in the late 19th century than he is today, and in his day he was certainly a king.
Whether this representation is fully valid is a continuing historical debate.
What is important is that the mid-17th century war marked the subsequent evolution of our nation, and Cromwell is a distinctly recognizable figure who represents one side of that conflict.
And his works are praiseworthy, and his works are honourable.
A Chinese farmer was cut down by a wild boar
According to local media reports, a farmer in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The South China Morning News reported on Sunday that the body of the man, identified as "Yan", was found near a tavern in the Liopanshi Market in Guizhou State, bleeding heavily and drowning in blood.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China, a farmer prepares to inject pigs with a vaccine in a pig pen.
Reports said she had come to Markit with her son from the neighboring Greek state on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
And his son-in-law came to the dead body early in the morning, and behold, the door was open, and the door was open.
He stated that there was a large male pig in the pond with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig had dismembered and killed the farmer's man.
The Xinhua news agency quoted the man's cousin, who calls himself "Wu", as saying that "Kakaim's son's legs were bloody and torn".
Security camera footage shows Yan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed her pigs.
Her body was discovered an hour later.
And the beast that hath smitten him shall not be his, nor his offspring.
The marketing manager told the Evening News that while police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was further confined to prevent the animal from attacking other individuals.
It is reported that Yan's family and Marquette officials are negotiating a cash settlement for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, previous cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife scared the animal into running away.
After an Oregon farmer was preyed upon by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS that pigs are not generally aggressive but that blood tasting acts as a "mouse".
"They're just for fun.
They're kids, they're very curious ... they don't want to hurt you.
You have to give them the proper respect", he added.
The effects of the Rosea storm will cause extensive heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to weather forecasts, the storm has weakened as it moves toward the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, torrential rains will continue to occur throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time Saturday, Rosa had winds of 85 mph and was a Category 1 hurricane 385 miles southwest of Punta Eujana in Mexico.
It is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, a mid-ocean wave will begin to form in the Pacific Ocean and flow eastward toward the west coast of the United States.On Monday, it will begin to push the deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwest United States as it approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm.
Monday's rainfall in parts of Mexico will be up to 10 inches.
Then, over the next few days, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching waveforms forms extensive, intense rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, damaging wetlands and possible landslides in deserts.
Extreme tropical humidity causes rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
About 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
It is possible that the scattered nature of tropical rainfall could lead to rapid deterioration of conditions at the same time as flooding.
It would be highly unwise to go out into the desert on foot without caution in situations where there is a risk of tropical rain.
And he will cause the waters to melt, and the waters shall be turned into waves; and he will cause the thunder to flash, and the whirlwind to blow, and the hail to come.
Amid the approaching waves, heavy rainfall will bring localized thunderstorms to parts of the Southern California coast.
Overall, there is a chance of rainfall of more than half an inch, which can cause soil and debris to flow and make roads slippery.
This will be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
Late Sunday and early Monday, some scattered tropical cyclones begin to approach Arizona before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
And it shall rain on the four corners of the earth from Tuesday to Wednesday.
October will see extreme temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic cools but the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to sudden changes in temperature over short periods of time.
On Sunday, a prominent example of sudden temperature variations will occur across the central United States.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the current summer heat will begin again and increase.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to witness the onset of summer with temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to the northeastern regions.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Throughout the first half of October in the eastern United States, our long-term climate forecast suggests a chance for higher-than-average temperatures.
Over 20 million people watched the Bert Kavanaugh trial
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the influential testimony of Bert Kavanaugh and a woman in the Supreme Court who accused him of sexual harassment that apparently occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political deadlock continued with the regular Friday broadcasts interrupted, with a sudden last-minute change of situation: a draft agreement by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was submitted to the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was flirting with him and trying to take his clothes off at a high school prom.
Kavanagh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
Nielsen reported that it was likely seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculates the average viewing figures across CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC channels.
Statistics from other networks including PBS, CPN and Fox Commercial Network that aired it were not available at the time.
And Nielsen typically has trouble counting people who see in offices.
This is thought to be similar to the attendance at a football final or an academic award ceremony.
Nielsen stated that Fox News, which analysts strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leader with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day of the court hearing.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued to be high after the meeting.
Flick was the central character in the Friday adventure.
After the Republican Central Committee issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he walked into a Judiciary Committee meeting and protesters shouted at him.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes closed, so much so that he was severely affected by the reproach and the live broadcast by CNN.
A woman cried out, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the people?
She was told, "You have power that most women do not".
Flick said his office had issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the committee meeting before the meeting was closed.
Hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to raise the voting criteria to the level of a majority of Senators for Kavanagh's nomination, cable and television networks covered it live.
But Flick said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would hear the charges against the nominee next week, which is what the minority Democrats are also insisting on.
Flick was relatively persuaded by the comments of his friend Sen. Chris Koons of the Democratic Party.
Flick made the decision after talking to Knesset and later with a number of other senators.
Flick's choice was powerful, as it was clear that Republicans did not have the voting power to approve Kavanaugh's research without it.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend the Conservative Party conference.
In another interview in the same issue, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denounced the so-called Brexit Checklist Plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was "very ridiculous".
Wade Simms Shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson on suspicion of killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wade Simms for the murder of a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his jacket during the fight.
CBS affiliate WFB reported that police found the glasses at the scene and admitted that they had found Simpson's DNA on them.
Police said after questioning Simpson that he confessed to Wade's fatal shooting.
The defense attorney says that his bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Office of Trauma released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police Task Force for tracking down the fugitive, the state Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police, and local residents for their cooperation in the investigation that led to the arrest of the fugitive.
LSU athletic director Joey Aliva praised the law enforcement for "seeking justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball team.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the death of Wade had hit Geach and Tcon.
Wade said, "That's not something you always worry about".
Volcanic ash erupted over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico City.
After the volcano erupted from the crater, the National Center for Crisis Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano, confirming 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitors multiple vibrations and vibrations.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash covering windshields in Mexico City such as the Zucchimilco area.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck central Mexico in September 2017, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Gio has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands took part in protests against the first anniversary of the controversial secession vote.
Riot police threw eggs and powder at a group of masked pro-independence protesters, creating a black cloud on roads that are usually a tourist attraction.
Later in the day, protesters also clashed with police, which prompted police to use handcuffs to prevent clashes.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Not Forgotten, Not Forgiven", which was met with cries of pro-Spanish solidarity protesters.
According to local media reports, fourteen were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considered illegal but welcomed by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region still remain high.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low and opponents boycotted the separation vote.
According to Catalan officials, around 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to prevent the formation of protests in support of the National Police.
The protests continued but were forced to take a different course.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalan independence.
He added that "Last year we had the best moments of our lives.
I could see my parents crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are confused".
Despite managing a fateful, if modest, success in the regional elections in December, Catalan independence parties are struggling to maintain their resolve to move forward this year, with most of their known leaders either facing voluntary deportation or detention pending trial on charges of involvement in organizing the coup and the subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old man who recorded protests in support of police on his phone, said clashes were being fomented by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more complicated", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Janqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pretrial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections will be the best way to reverse the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he stated.
London: arrest of several men after car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The news of the incident was published on Thursday at 19:30 BST in Ballinaur Crescent.
Death Inspect Bob Blimings stated that the gates and the building itself were destroyed.
Some parts of the motor have also been shot with a bow and arrow.
Minga's 0-1 win over Rangers was a victory for Livingston.
Dolly Minga's first goal kept the win for Livingston.
Livingston's promotion to the top flight was shaken by the Rangers' defeat, their second loss in 18 games as manager of Iberrocks.
The double-stroke proved to be a clear margin as Gary Halt's side finished second to the Hibernians.
The Gerrard side remained without a win-loss record for the championship this season and will face the eight-point-defeated Leeders Hertz on Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston continues its undefeated lead in the division with six games under Halt's leadership since replacing Kenny Miller last month, who is yet to experience a defeat.
Livingston lost the chance to Blunt Visitor.
The Halt team, with a manager who also created all sorts of problems for the Rangers, should have progressed long before they scored.
Scott Robinson overcame the obstacles but reversed his attempt along the goal, then Alan Lithgow only managed to manage his attempt on the scoresheet after slipping to prevent Craig Halcott from hitting his head along the goal.
The hosts were happy with the Rangers' play in front of them, even though they knew they had the ability to catch the team in certain scenes.
This is where the fatal trick happened.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took the opening moves, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson both trying to pass Minga, who hit a slow shot and scored from his position.
At this point, Rangers were dominating but found the main defence impassable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was certainly not worried.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos defended to prevent a goal from scoring.
Scott Pittman's lead was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow with a wide-scoring touchdown.
The progression continued steadily to Livingston Field, which was consistently defended, although two penalty shootouts were abandoned after Halcott's claim on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for Handball by a point.
"Fantastic" from Livingston  Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony MacCarthy Square
A fantastic performance and a result for Livingston
These were great for a man who went beyond expectations on the ascent of the launch.
Since returning to the top flight, their playing style and players have changed little, but most points have come to Halt since he entered the field because of the way he motivates the team.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halcott was excellent, managing a very consistent defence while Minga worried Connor Goldson and Joey Worrall throughout the match.
Although the Rangers lacked internal motivation.
They were doing very well when they were under the care of GERAD, but they don't have those criteria anymore.
They were missing the final ball - they only opened the main wing once - and it was something of a wake-up call for Rangers to realize they were in a safe place.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting of the Turkish and German leaders at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) was overshadowed by laughter and fantasy.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's adventurous trip to Germany, which aims to rebuild ties between NATO allies.
They had tensions over issues such as human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new large mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish nationals residing outside Turkey.
Police prevented the large crowd of 25,000 people from entering the mosque due to security concerns, but the vast majority of supporters gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdoğan protesters - most of them Kurds - also raised their voices, condemning Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflected a different split in which the German Turks welcomed the visitor as a hero and the other side denounced him as a tyrant.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: Cyclist killed in collision with motorcycle
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision with a motorcycle.
The incident occurred at 10:15 BST near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver stopped and first responders arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childress Road, approximately one mile from the scene on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said that their officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road block and the route of the buses was changed and motorcyclists were instructed to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
The prison administration said six prison officers were injured in the riot at the men's prison, which is under intense security measures.
The riots began around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartine in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Tornado Special Operations personnel arrived on the scene to contain the riot, which included eight prisoners and a building crew.
The officers received minor facial injuries at the scene of the accident.
A Prison Service spokesperson stated, "Special trained personnel have been deployed to contain the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartine.
The injuries of six staff members were treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prison, and we strongly state that those responsible for the incident have been referred to the police and will spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to contain a violent riot in which employees were attacked by billiard balls.
Tornadoes threaten flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (dry areas will benefit).
It is rare for a tropical cyclone to strike Arizona, but it is exactly what is likely to happen as early as next week if the energy of the Rosea storm flows southwest along the desert, which will entail the risks of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has now issued flood watch warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, which will extend into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to make a direct path to Phoenix on Tuesday, closing with rain later on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "Since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical or subtropical storm status within 200 miles of Phoenix.
"Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Management forecasts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches and up to 6 inches in remote areas such as the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to see rainfall of 1 to 2 inches and up to 4 inches in total in remote areas.
For those who are not afraid of floods, for these regions are dry, the early rain shall be their blessing.
Although flooding is a very serious concern and because the Southeast is currently experiencing a drought situation, some of this rain is likely to be useful.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Drought Control, only over 40% of Arizona experiences at least one severe drought, which is the second highest category", weather.com reported.
The cyclone's path along the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico ends in a landfall.
On Sunday morning, a strong gale with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 mph, moved southward toward Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moved northward at 12 mph.
In the Pacific he is met with a tempest, and his strength is cut off.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with a strong storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico will pose a serious risk of flooding.
weather.com reports that "a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches".
After that, it will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning, then make its way from Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The major forecasted hazards or impacts are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and mudslides in the deserts and mountain slopes in the mountains.
Meadsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenage boy was found wounded at 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was transferred to hospital where he is in "good" health.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have called for any person who has photographed the incident by telephone to testify.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "involved in the post-war and Democratic anger"
Trump stated at a rally in Wheeling, South Virginia that "voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics".
Trump said Kavanagh had been "interference and anger" of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently and emotionally denying allegations by Kristen Blassy Ford that she sexually harassed him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing against her.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people saw the talent, the skill and the courage" Kavanagh showed that day.
"Vote to confirm Judge Kavanagh", he told his West Virginia supporters, "vote to confirm one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a rich record of public service".
While speaking about the importance of rallying Republicans in the midterm elections, the president made a marginal reference to Kavanagh's candidacy.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running for office, I'm actually running".
"That's why I'm fighting for the top candidate everywhere".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a "resist and deter" mission.
A senior deputy to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first key trial vote in the Senate chamber on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place by Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, casualties rising
Officials said on Saturday that a massive wave that hit the coast and triggered a powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people and destroyed many more.
On Friday, as hundreds gathered for a festival in Palo, a six-meter (18-foot) wave hit the beach, blacking out, killing many and destroying everything in its path.
The earthquake was followed by a tsunami with a magnitude of 7.5.
Soto Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB, said at a news conference in Jakarta that "people were still busy along the coast yesterday when the tsunami threat was raised and did not immediately flee and thus suffered".
"It was not a tsunami alone, it took away motorcycles, tree clippings, houses and everything on the ground", he said, adding that the tsunami was flowing along the high seas at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Space images released by the Natural Disasters Agency showed a large number of destroyed buildings and shops, dilapidated and destroyed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city was shaken by the same force.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force exerted by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He stated that the city's geographical location, at the end of a long and narrow bay, has increased the volume of the tsunami's spread.
Nogruho described the destruction as "extensive", stating that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels were destroyed.
He said several bodies of victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Novogruhu said that along the 300 km (190 mi) coast north of Palo, the area known as Dongola, and closer to the epicenter, casualties would be higher.
Novogruho stated that communications were "completely paralyzed and information was not available" from Dongola.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people were living there, and staff and volunteers have been deployed to the affected areas".
He said, "It is already a tragedy, but it will get worse".
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami that hit Palo, although officials said the waves arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In an informal video posted on social media, a man's voice was heard from the top of a building whistling warning of an approaching tsunami to people on the road below.
Within minutes a dam hit the shore, crushing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the tape.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power and communications outages, which made it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but the rescued people are in dire need of food and other basic necessities, according to officials.
The airfield in these cities has reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to more than 800
This is terrible.
Mr. Duseba stated that while World Vision employees had safely arrived from Dongola to Palo, where employees were busy setting up trampoline tents in their office premises, they had passed devastating scenes on the way.
And he said, They told me, saying, Behold, the houses are desolate, and the houses are left in ruins.
This is very bad.
Although relief groups were taking the necessary measures to help, some complained that travel by foreign aid specialists to Palo was prevented.
Under Indonesian regulations, equipment financing and recruitment from abroad is only permitted if the crisis area is declared a national crisis area.
This has never happened before.
"It is still a state-level crisis", said Ulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Yes, this is a national crisis,' we can move on to international assistance, but this legal status has not yet been created".
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami unfolded, friends and family members of the missing victims still hope for a miracle that will change the unpleasant lines of the natural disaster narrative.
On Saturday, a toddler was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman with her mother's body lying next to her, who had been trapped under the rubble for two days.
Gindon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Parachute Team, had trained two missing parachute players for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were locked in the hotel room, including Mr. Manan, were his disciples.
He said, "As a competitor in the parachute diving, I carry my emotions once".
Mr. Gindon recounted how he was paratrooping in the community in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Rova Rova Hotel was reported, as he sent numerous messages to the Polo competitors participating in the Beach Festival on WhatsApp.
However, the result of his messages was only one gray mark instead of a pair of blue marks.
He said, "I think it meant no texting".
Thieves steal $26750 from an earthen dam in Newport during re-deposit of ATMs
According to a Newport Police Department news release, robbers stole $26750 from Brink's employee who was depositing an ATM at an earthen dam in Newport on Friday morning.
A motorist at the amusement complex was clearing an ATM and was ready to add more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the newsletter.
While he was at work, someone else "run after Brink's employee" and stole a box of money that was meant to be delivered to him.
According to the news release, eyewitnesses identified several suspects who fled the scene, but police did not specify the number of persons involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should call Newport Police at 3680-292-859.
Kanye West: Rapper turns his name into Yee
Kanye West changes his rapper name to  Yi
He announced the name change on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, who had been nicknamed Yee for some time, titled her eighth album Manicure, which was released in June.
The change came in the wake of her appearance at a Saturday night live concert where she is set to unveil her new album Yandy.
The show's creator stated that he would be replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current name, West has said that the word has religious significance to him.
Speaking to Radio Big By host Wes Durvale last year about the album title, he said, "I think 'Y' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'".
"Well, I am you, I am us, this is us.
I changed from koné, which means only one, to just yi, which is simply a reflection of good, bad, confusion, and everything else we have.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Poof Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced the names Lou and Brother Lou as his preferred names.
A former West colleague, Jay-Z, also came up with a solution with a spacing line and uppercase letters.
Mexico pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged in Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military forces shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 as leftist student movements took shape across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youths studying with government subsidies and more openings of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving youth towards criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
This was after various U.S. government departments made announcements about AI, although the U.S. as a whole lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China unveiled its plan: it aims to reach position 1 by 2030 in AI inventions.
"Doubling AI research funding would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, we expect a major breakthrough in the field of AI", Lee said.
This week, Lee said in an interview with CNBC that doubling funding would double the chances of achieving the next big achievement in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "All Superpowers: China, the Silsson Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of SunVenture and has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
He worked on the artificial intelligence system that defeated Attilio, the highest-ranking American player, at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, and later became CEO of Microsoft Research and head of Google's China office.
Lee praised the former U.S. government for technological competitions such as the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and sought to organize a new round to help identify future concepts.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is turning away the scientific leaders, it's the institutions", Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired leading experts from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy would also help the United States to strengthen efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think the green card should be automatically given to people with PhDs in AI", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation AI development plan.
Li noted that the China Natural Science Foundation, like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that distribute money to U.S. researchers, funded members of academic institutions, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, with the goal of bringing together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 million investment in an AI Next initiative.
In conjunction with the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislature, which sought to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence, has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that will resolve decades-long tensions with Greece that have hampered efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers its northern neighbour's name to mean a claim to its territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the European Union.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slav majority population.
President George Iwano stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has led to speculation as to whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent criterion for a referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Do you want to join NATO and Europe by accepting a deal with Greece?"
Proponents of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaiavu, argue that Macedonia's bid for membership in the European Union and NATO is also worth the cost, a country that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country and the youth of Macedonia so that they can live independently under the umbrella of the European Union because that means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgiuska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they accept the outcome of the vote to be definitive.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.
The government's Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout in this poll was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Jos Taniewski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
September 30, 2018 In Stromeka, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaiev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardako prepared a small stage and set up checkpoints in front of the tent set up by referendum boycotts.
"We are supportive of NATO and the EU, but we want to achieve membership with a high head, not through the gate of service", Kawaradoko said.
We are a poor nation, but we are honourable.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go elsewhere like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zhao says NATO membership will attract much-needed investment while the unemployment rate is over 20%.
Zayed said after casting his vote: "I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO".
He said a "yes" result would "correct our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters below the required turnout would participate in the referendum.
The findings of another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telema showed 57% of respondents decided to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To win the referendum, the turnout must be 50 plus one percent.
The referendum defeat marked the first severe blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero Manchester City from midfield to goal
On Saturday at Manchester City's United Stadium, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling scored a 0-2 win for Manchester City with a quick spin from the defending champions Brighton.
Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute with ease.
The Argentine goalkeeper scored a pass from midfield at the start of the season.
He competed for the title among three defenders before breaking the free field.
And he saw the four corners of the green, and behold, he was in the midst of the green.
He ran quickly several times at the corner of the penalty area before he passed a defender.
Then he passed to his left to Sterling.
The English forward made his first entry into the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit the right foot into the right side of the net towards goalkeeper Brighton Matthew Ryan.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters, "Aguero is struggling with some of the issues he is facing".
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was our luck that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Stirling who gave the Blue Sky their first point in the Premier League fight.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball inside the Brighton field.
He passed a beautiful pass along the left flank that passed through the opposing team and was delivered to Leroy San.
San did a few exercises with the ball before running towards the goal vertical.
The Blue Sky forward caught the ball before slipping off the field.
At 12:55 on Saturday at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Schönheim, Germany, City will take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game.
Max Schreiser wants to go to the Rockies for a home run.
While the national team was eliminated from the competition in the final game, there was little reason to have to start over.
But the ever-rival Scherzer is hoping to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a final outcome for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies earned at least one warning card with a 2-5 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to hold on to the division title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we'll at least be able to create a problem for the final round knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is crowded and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any score I've seen in my current year.
Why shouldn't I compete?"
The Nationals are yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but reports suggest they preferred to allow Schreiser to pitch in a single-season.
Schreiser, who is set to make his 34th start, hit a hard hit on Thursday and will pitch with normal ease on Sunday.
This season, the Washington right-hander is 7-18 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is meeting in West Virginia
While speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the President pointed out the situation related to the selection of Bert Kavanaugh by the Supreme Court.
"Everything we do is in November.
We are six weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
This is very important and very important. I am not contesting in elections but I am actually contesting, which is why I am contesting for the top candidate everywhere", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the ugliness.
They don't care who gets hurt, they only want to get power and control, and we're not going to give them what they want".
He said Democrats are on a "resistance and deterrence" mission.
He said, "And you've seen it in the last four days", calling Democrats "angry, mean, ugly, and liars".
He was met by a loud cheering by the audience, referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee while referring to Sen. Deanne Feinstein, a Democrat, with reference to her position.
"Do you remember what he said?
Did you divulge the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, oh no, I'm waiting for one. It was really a nonverbal language. It was the worst nonverbal language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a party
This is intolerable to those who express their views.
When my fellow activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was absolutely amazing.
After all, I was the last person in the ranks of Labour MPs in Parliament who wasn't welcomed - all because we expressed our views.
My colleague John Ryan was treated in the same way, because he too stood firmly against the Jews.
In my case, my censorship movements were criticized for being anti-Carbinism.
Crime critically disagreed with former leaders on the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and other similar issues.
A statement on Friday for the East Nottingham Workers' Party meeting stated that "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During my eight years as a local Labour Party member of Parliament, the GC's Friday night meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this space is missing in most meetings, and the promise of a "gentler and more polite" policy has been forgotten by many and will never return.
It is increasingly evident that opposing views are not taken into account in the Labour Party and that attention is paid to views that are acceptable to the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy took over, as a colleague with those I had previously thought shared similar political views, who were expected to change course and take a position I had never agreed with either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - their peers make fiery speeches on social media demanding de-escalation and dismissal of central politics and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one.
In fact, I am happier than my other peers as opinions about me are more politically oriented.
I am amazed at the tenacity and determination of my fellow citizens who are flooded with sexual and racial abuse statements every day but never feel ashamed.
One of the most frustrating areas of contemporary politics is how levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Carbin called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer who we are, and with every "no confidence" move or change in election rules, this party will be further depressed.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years, being told to keep my head down, not to be so loud and to "be good".
But that's not why I got into politics.
32 years before the day I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy, I was inspired by the Thatcher government's neglect that had literally led to the collapse of my comprehensive school curriculum, and I was trying to fight to better serve those who needed it most - either as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was at all confused about the political positions and areas of opposition to the current leadership.
To those who launched the movement on Friday, I say to everyone that while the country is heading towards a hard Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I see no interest in spending my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I am sending is not to my client Nottingham, but to my clients, whether they are Labour or not. I am proud to serve you and pledge that no threat of disenfranchisement or political compromise will stop me from working in areas that I believe will serve your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 17-38 Milros: Ayr defeated undefeated
The last two attempts may have somehow changed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this amazing and entertaining Tennis Day championship.
They are currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the decade.
In the end, it was their superior defense that further increased the chances that the main wing did it, and coach Peter Murci was right to be pleased.
He said, "We were tested in this game, and we are not defeated yet, so I have to be happy".
Robin Christie Milros said: "The advantage goes back to Ireland, they had a better chance than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt was repulsed by Fraser Clemmo, with Ayr taking the lead but a yellow card was given to Scotland captain Larry Hoggs who was given up for the match by the Warriors, allowing Mirlows to express the numbers and Jason Baggott to take an irreversible attempt.
Clemmough hit Ayr with his hand, which was awarded a penalty, scored before half-time, then began a slow attempt to score to Ayr at the 5-17 break.
However, Milros started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort was repulsed by Baggott, who reduced Levy to five points.
A long hiatus was then called due to the severe injury to Rowrid Knott, who was lying down, and a resumption of the wave of fire passed through Stafford McDowall's effort, defended by Clemm.
Ayr were given a yellow card by captain Blair McPherson and again Milros was given an extra against an unsuccessful attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of a sudden-death attack.
However, the main wing came back, and when Strouhan Hutchinson caught a yellow card from the penalty mark by holding the ball without hitting it, McPherson collided with the back of the forward's head, causing him to fall to the ground.
Clemm started, while he did almost everything from the beginning again, punching Kelly Roy in David Armstrong's penalty area and throwing Gregory Henry to the wings on the fifth attempt.
Steel Game star prepares for her new career in the restaurant industry
Steel Game star Ford Kieran appears to be moving into the hospitality business after it was revealed that he was the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old, who stars and writes for the BBC's Jack Jarvis, starred alongside long-time comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
Both couples announced that the upcoming Ninth Dynasty would be the final episode of the show, featuring Keeran planning her life after Craigellong.
According to official histories, he is the director of Adriftam Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a Scottish source noted that Kearnon was seeking a partnership in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
"Our Sea": Surrounded by land, Bolivia hopes court will open the way to the Pacific
And the sailors, who were going with the ship, and who had the chain and the rope, made their home in La Paz.
Blue-water flags are waving above public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are engraved with the slogan: "The sea is legally ours".
To regain it is a duty".
Across land-locked Bolivia, memories of losing a coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century war still stand - as does the sadness of once again sailing the Pacific.
These aspirations are likely to be at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a determination to move, a spirit of solidarity and perseverance and naturally expects the result with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Most Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, and hope that the court in The Hague - after decades of irregular negotiations - will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim, that Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia on the granting of an independent passage to the sea.
Bolivia's indigenous and charismatic president Evo Morales - who is facing a controversial run for re-election next year - is also in limbo for his ruling on Monday.
He promised in late August that "we are very close to returning to the Pacific".
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and if it does, it will not bring about much change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to cede territory to Chile, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Paz Zarati, an expert in international law in Chile, said the ICC's ruling just six months after the recent arguments were heard showed that the case was "not complicated".
And not only did Bolivia advance, the last four years may have turned it back.
Zarati said "the issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government".
Morales's wartime adage has undermined any remaining goodwill in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on some issues, but it is difficult to maintain discussions after this decision.
The two countries have not exchanged embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez-Wiltz, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, rejected claims that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
He said Monday would bring "a tremendous opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of dissent and common interests" to Bolivia.
Calzadilla also rejected Morales's claim - still one of the most influential presidents in Latin America - that he was using the issue of the sea as a political prop.
He added, "Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific".
"This ruling is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past".
North Korea says denuclearization won't happen as long as it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said his country would never disarm if it could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the commitments made at the Singapore Summit between rival leaders.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a deadlock over three months after Singapore and Kim Jong-un on the brink of resuming nuclear diplomacy.
Ri says that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration of an end to the Korean War will forever bring the North to its knees, an "impossible dream".
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking the necessary steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are calling for a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows showcases the latest fashion from the big clubs on their way to the highway near you.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block out the sun completely, don't wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown displayed a row of unusual curls for their SS19 collection in a hallway that was stunning amongst the collections at Paris Fashion Week.
The most unusual summer hats have taken Instagram by storm, and these designers have been planting their eye-catching creations in the hallways.
A ball standing by Valentino had an oversized hat decorated with a wide, plump edge that supported the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories include jewelled peppers, witch hats, and even pineapples - but they aren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of amazing masks for use only on Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Leker than high fashion clothing designs.
One of these creations resembled a water-playing breathing stick with a breathing apparatus and water-playing glasses, while another resembled a water-based ice cream cone.
And if you keep up the great fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Light watchers predict that flat, non-spike-sized buildings can reach highways near you.
Large-sized hats are heated on the heels of the Zella Bombas, a basket hat with a two-foot-wide rim on the head of everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The cult tag on the back of the hat, which is so useless, was spread on social media - introducing another great creativity to the hallway - a beach basket box roughly the size of the swimsuit model that covered it.
The burnt orange raffia box, which was chopped up with raffia fabrics and covered with a white leather band, was the ball standing in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
"I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive on the highway for the coming summers - since the designer has made such a big impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-size accessories", noted noted noted top designer Luke Armitage.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a track record of academic excellence, and in 2018 this continues with another set of outstanding test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.
The goal of Independent Schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will go into his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, the message goes to his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the recent examinations of the current year, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest scores amongst independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who had mastered foreign languages scored higher A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students in Mandarin achieved a higher A grade, while 72% of those who spoke German, 69% of those who spoke French, and 63% of those who spoke Spanish also achieved an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now offered as an elective subject, in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) curriculum in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Labour and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers give for trying to fill vacancies were attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more, language skills are becoming essential in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities expected that require language skills, these skills are crucial in the globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, having a lifelong skill like this has a real advantage in the future.
The ability to converse directly with people from foreign countries will automatically outperform a person with multi-lingual skills.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75% were not able to speak a foreign language sufficiently for conversation, and only a two-digit 15% were able to speak French.
That's why it's important to invest in language education for today's children.
Learning several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children a better chance of getting a meaningful job.
Within Scotland, the languages of instruction will vary from school to school.
Some schools will focus on very modern classical languages, while others will teach languages that are more important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese, by 2020.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages offered in independent schools with specialized teachers.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a secondary education environment where children are prepared and equipped with the skills they need to succeed and what the future will require.
In the present day, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages are of vital importance for the future of the country, and therefore language must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "skills of international communication".
Independent schools continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
And ye shall do this thing.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
On Sunday, Lee Brown will host the Lakers' first National Championship game in San Diego.
The wait is almost over, and fans are looking forward to seeing LeBron James in his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James will play in Sunday's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He said, "I don't need any pre-season training at this stage of my career".
Trump Summit timing in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five planned meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump intends to win support in the upcoming midterm elections by voting to approve his nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump Summit is scheduled to take place in West Virginia on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch the live broadcast of Trump's West Virginia rally online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to make a speech at this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh, which was tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with the anticipated Senate confirmation vote for a week-long FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of the rally is to help Republicans, who are affected by the November election and want to hasten it.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign said the five meetings next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House".
A Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters that controlling Congress was so on his agenda that he would travel to all states he could if necessary, on the eve of the campaign season.
According to Metro News West Virginia, the rally scheduled for tonight at Whispanco Field in Wheeling could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media".
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help win the low-voting Republican Senate nominee for West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey.
"That the president should come and win the election for Morrissey is not a good sign for him", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show their determination to fight to keep the hopes alive in Sunday's singles match
After three seasons of one-sidedness, a four-man game on Saturday afternoons may be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging speed is a fairly original sporting concept but players who are really interested in it have never been interested in other competitions like this game.
So where do they say fast-moving is now?
Jordan Spithe said while calling for the day of the race: "They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I guess I'll give it a little bit of a boost".
Europe holds the points, but is four points ahead with twelve games to go.
As Spithe says, Americans feel like they have the wind in their sails and they have it exactly and they should be very encouraged, at least Spithe and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each have three points out of four.
Spithe's progress from goal to field is excellent and serves as a precedent.
As soon as it was his turn, the screams of the horns grew louder, and while he and Thomas were two points clear, they scored four extra points by throwing the ball into the hole.
The other pitch, which scored 15 points, was met with similar shouts, suggesting that he believed the U.S. team was not excluded.
Spithe said, "You really have to hit the target and be concerned about your race".
These are the only players left at the moment.
18 holes to create a mark.
The only players to score more points over the last two days than Spite and Thomas are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
A unique pair, but praised in Europe, four of four, and they do not err.
"Mollywood" were the only pair to not throw a par-over on Saturday afternoon, but they also refrained from hitting on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine back on Friday morning.
The manner in which the eager crowd apparently consumed their energy motivated the players to win on Sunday, and as the sun set over Lee Golf National, there was no longer a dominant player to score a potential win for Europe.
Preferably both were located simultaneously on different cavities.
However, it is still premature to talk about the glory and grandeur of Europe.
Boba Watson and Webb Simpson, along with Alex Norn, ended up defeating Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball champion.
One single and two doubles against the nine-man squad, the Spaniards and the Swedes were in the hole and they never climbed it.
Even on Sunday, no one will help you get out of the hole.
Because of the interaction between the two players, the advice they gave and did not give, and the way a strategy can make immediate changes, watching the four-man and four-man teams up close is very interesting.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and has secured a crucial lead to reach the final, but this four-man season also showed that the United States team is determined to fight against this number, especially as the Americans themselves were skeptical.
Europe won the Ryder Cup final 10-6
Europe successfully advanced to the Ryder Cup final after leading 6-10 against the United States in the quadruple and quadruple events.
The motivated pair of Tommy Flight and Francesco Molinari were thrilling, with a win over Tiger Woods to keep their points in the NL West at four points.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, trying to retain their trophy they had lost two years earlier at Hazleton, won the morning game four-a-side to the American defeat, taking the series 1-3 from the series.
The United States showed more resistance in the four-man event, winning two races but failing to come back from a point deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain their title.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four in a row, while she and Molinari, who are both dubbed "Mollywood", are only the second pair to win four since their four-race debut in Ryder history, after an exciting weekend away.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foursome, they went on a wild goose chase to beat Woods' undefeated rookie Bryson DiCampo by a score of 4&5.
Woods, who tied his game with two on Saturday, excelled in the special events but he lost 19 of his 29 games in the quadruple and four-man events and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, while resting for the morning foursome, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome, beating Johnson's 1&2 teammates and Brooks Kopka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe was not all that it was on such a pleasant and windy day, southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spithe and Justin Thomas, who won the grand slam three times, determined the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They won the double by 2&1 against John Rahm and Ian Polter of Spain in a four-hole playoff, and then came back to beat Trump and Larry McLaren by losing the opening two holes to score 3&4 in a four-hole playoff.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to play in the singles, although as the defending champions, the Forks need only a draw to retain the trophy.
However, after two days in the top two, it looks like the counter-attack on Sunday will be beyond them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament "no way out" without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would create mistrust of the United States and that his country could not unilaterally abandon its nuclear arsenal under such circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual meeting of the World Body of the General Assembly that North Korea had made "significant goodwill actions" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying a nuclear test site, and pledging non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States of America, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to unilaterally disarm first".
While Re repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization and to taking gradual steps in this area, in return for which North Korea would be rewarded, his comments were seen as important in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first withdraw from its nuclear arsenal.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first,' increasing the level of pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by forceful means, and even opposes 'declaring the end of the war,'" Re said.
"The realization that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an unrealistic dream for those who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions only increase our distrust".
Ri did not mention any plans for the second Kim-Trump meeting that the US leader had mentioned earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding, "If it was the opposing side of the denuclearization issue, South Korea and not the United States, the destruction of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this halt".
However, the tone of Rhee's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was unwarranted after President Trump's "Mr. Evil" called Kim a "missile man" for a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy North Korea", praised Kim for his courage in disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with seriousness and without fail until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in June, saying that within hours progress had been made only for North Korea, condemning him for having "similar demands from the terrorist group".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy the missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
He said Kim told him the "relevant steps" he was seeking were the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses for a rest
A new course at Harvard this year calls on all students who sleep more to combat the growing culture of studying nighttime coffee.
The findings of one university show that students at the world's number one university are often indifferent about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I being told this now that I'm a senior?"
He told the Telegraph that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains the essentials of how good sleep habits help students with academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatric health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a lily room where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, tutors, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of daily sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive symbols, then encourages participants to think about their everyday affairs.
"We know that this behavior of students will not change immediately.
"We believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking choices", Professor Chesler added.
There is still a culture of pride in "sleeping the night away", he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students that causes sleep deprivation has been a growing problem.
He said ensuring adequate and good quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even leading to weight loss, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old Californian who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sisler design the course, as he had one of his classes with him last year during his first year at Harvard.
She said that the course has opened her eyes and motivated her to pursue a university-level course.
He expressed hope that the next step would require all postgraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Zeisler advised that students should set alarm clocks to go to bed and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" exposed by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your daytime rhythm and lead to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Minga defeated Gerard players
While the strike of Dally Manga's broken wing defeated Steven Gerrard 0-1 at Livingston, the Rangers faced another scary match.
After a 1-4 victory on February 1 at St Johnstone, the Eburrows were looking to record their first win, but Gary Holt's team only recorded a second defeat to Gerard in 18 games as head coach to give up eight points of their lead to lead the Leeds Heartless to the Ladbrokes championship.
Minga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' lineup was unbalanced, lacking motivation.
With Rangers now falling to sixth, Livingston is third by goal difference, just behind Hibernian.
After an apparent object was thrown from a distance and hit the head of referee Colum Spence's line, he had to undergo treatment, and there may have been problems with Rangers' ambush.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that eliminated former Ayr in the semi-final stage of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same 11 leverage that earned him a Hertz point last week, and he will be pleased with how well he performed in each turn, preventing his opponents from being grouped.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston made more of an effort with the ball in their hands.
They were to score within two minutes of Scott Pittman's first Minga shot to goal from Alan McGregor, but the midfielder with the most chances tried hard.
Keegan Jacobs' strong free kick went to captain Craig Halcott, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, returned it only behind the penalty area from a good angle.
The Rangers regained their dominance but seemed more hopeful than certain about their play in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos definitely felt that a penalty should have been announced at the quarter-final stage, because he and Steven Lawold had faced each other, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers only managed to hold two shots in the first half on goal but former Iberrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly struggled with a Lasagna-Coli Bally attack from Ajax.
While Levi's 34th-minute penalty may have been against the flow, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their own touchdown.
Again, the Rangers were unable to resist Jacobs' deep punch.
While DeKlan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson and held himself until Minga could simply throw the ball into the goal, Scott Arfield showed no reaction.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent at half-time with a collie, and the change had an almost immediate effect as the striker hit Morelos but the amazing Kelly went off his own line to block it.
But Livingston continued to accurately capture the attention of the spectators by performing the type of play they enjoyed, as Lithgow and Halcutt threw the ball over long distances one after the other.
Holt were able to increase their lead in the final stages but McGregor stopped to stop Jacobs before Lithgow came out of the corner.
Glen Middleton's Rangers replacement had another penalty claim delayed because he had collided with Jacobs but again Thompson missed.
Almanak: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning in Germany: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually became known as the Geiger-Manthe Counter.
Since its introduction as a major branch of science, the Geiger counter has become an influential and even mainstream culture, as depicted in the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, starring seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
"What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geoglyph counter that is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms being turned off by radioactivity in the mineral".
Evans: "Say, it's definitely ticking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that is named after him shall not be destroyed.
New cancer vaccine could train the immune system to "watch" rebellious cells
New cancer vaccine could train the immune system to "watch" and kill rebellious cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify rebellious cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can "see" and re-inject the protein common to many cancers.
The experimental vaccine in patients with a range of cancers shows promising results.
A woman undergoing treatment with a vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize malignant cells, found that her ovarian cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab to see the protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then rebuilding the cells.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzowski, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzowski explained that HER2 "involves the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar approach of removing immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a type of worker's blood cancer.
Kanye West began to criticize Trump's pro-life stance after appearing at a Saturday night live concert wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio listening to Who after a lively performance during a Saturday night live concert in which he praised the United States.President Donald Trump said he would run for president in 2020.
She reiterated her support for Trump in a rally against Democrats after performing her third song that night, Ghost Town, in which we bring glory back to America.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the US a long time ago".
Saturday night's live concert kicked off the show with a performance by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Burt Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment allegations by Christine Blessy Ford.
Although not aired, footage of West's orgasm was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock the West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that he had a difficult time behind the scenes with his hat.
"They assaulted me behind the scenes.
And they said to him, Thou shalt not go in with that helmet.
They have laid hold of me, they have laid hold of me.
"And then they said I was drowned somewhere", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sinking?" while saying that he was "going to build Superman, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try love".
Variety reported that despite his comments leading to the audience bowing at least twice and the cast members appearing embarrassed at Saturday night's live concert, another person present told the publication: "The whole studio went silent".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Joan McMiller had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by performing I Love it, and was dressed as a Bottle Perrier.
West was backed by TPUSA Conservative Group Chair Candice Turner with a tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for standing up for MOB".
But Karen Hunter, the TV host, tweeted that West was simply "a totally amazing person".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or sponsoring his 'art'), but rather someone who I believe has ideas and spreads them that are harmful to my community".
He is free.
He added, "We are".
Prior to the performance, rapper Juan announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pedi.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Line, and of course Prince, the musical icon, changed his name to a symbol and the artist eventually became known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for assault and knife-wielding in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Baliyakamore.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast's local court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kate Harington, star of The Crown and Toxic Manhood, was heavily criticized
Kate Harington is best known for her portrayal of Snow's swordswoman in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has faced the stereotype of a masculine hero, and says such roles on television screens mean young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Keith stated that he believed "something went wrong" and asked about how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kate, who recently married her co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that she felt "absolutely serious" about dealing with the issue.
And she said, I am very much in the habit of saying, What is there to be done with the male?
What shall we teach men, that we should see such a thing?
Kate believes television is partly responsible for the rise of male toxicity due to its male characters.
He continued, 'What is inherent, and what is acquired?
Does what is taught on TV and on the streets make young boys feel that they should be this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
For they have made a way for the young men.
He also admitted in an interview that after the series' finale next summer, he would not be playing in any previous or subsequent installments, adding that "with battlefields and horses, it's over".
From November, Kate will star in Sam Shepard's revival of True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is on the run.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Day to be the best thing he's ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
He said, "I met my wife at the show, and in this way, she gave me my future family and my life".
Day played Yeager, Kate's favorite lover, as John Snow, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% surge in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sexual contact, and this is changing from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China due to the transmission of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Greece that the number of people infected with HIV by this method has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese transgender community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against transgender people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most infectious diseases are caused by inadequate sexual care in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to global access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this issue.
Maxine Waters calls the leaks of GOP senators denied by one of her staff "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators was published on Wikipedia's lawmakers pages by one of her employees.
Los Angeles Democrats emphasized that these claims were spread by experts and "right-wing" websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter: "Lies, lies and more hateful lies".
The released information includes home addresses and phone numbers of senators such as Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Irwin Hatch, both from Utah, USA.
The information was released online on Thursday by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate court hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh.
The revelation came moments after three Senators from Kavanagh were questioned.
Hill said conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the emails had contacted Waters' office and had published information from one of Waters' staff members.
Waters continued: "This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false and misleading claims - were not responsible for the disclosure of this information in any way.
This is a completely false claim and a complete lie. "
Waters's comments prompted criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "This denial is due to anger".
He said, "That shows that he doesn't believe he's a Congressman.
When a person is accused of doing something, he should not be angry.
They shouldn't hate.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They shall be quiet, and they shall be quiet.
Fleischer was apparently trying to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is trying to sideline Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that his office had "warned law enforcement agencies and agencies about these fraudulent claims".
He continued, "We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members".
Johnny English Strikes Review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spoof spyof
Recognizing the importance of Brexit in any new film has become a traditional British attitude, which seems to have been revived by the revival of the satirical comedy film company Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and gradually revived again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deprecating humor with ridiculous imitation of how blatantly we are be the new export opportunity for the country?
However, Johnny the Englishman, wide-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent, has been licensed to re-create things that are broken for the second time - his name is a sign more than anything else that he is a great innovator of humor that will be for the lands of English-speaking cinema.
He is of course the stupid secret agent who, despite his eccentric self-deprecating for his elegant linguistic grease and a bit of claudio, had the passion and taste of Mr. Bean and a doll that helped the man with a single note as the song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He also originally starred in, based on, the traveller and mystery international man Atkinson in the once-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial that followed the chaos.
There are a couple of beautiful moments in Johnny English's last leisure trip.
I fell in love with the moment Johnny the Englishman approached the helicopter, wearing his medieval armor and the blades of the helicopter wheel moving slowly in front of his helmet with a will.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the overall humor is presented with inadequate force and is strangely unnecessary, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible itself can now confidently make up comedy as a material.
The joke feels more targeted at children than adults, and I don't think the English Johnny Depp tragedies are as creative and focused as the silent film temptations of Atkinson's silly interstellar characters.
The enduring argument is that the UK is now facing a serious problem.
A cyber thief has infiltrated the UK's top-secret spy network, exposing all the UK agents involved, and has alarmed the task force  with a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing worth doing for a prime minister who is a shy, shy face and is currently in a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Terra-Me character but there is not much in the script to work with.
His intelligence advisors inform him that if any active spy is exposed, he will have to take someone out of retirement.
And that means that the disorderly Englishman Johnny, himself now working as a school administrator in some of the institutions, is giving an unprecedented lesson in how to conduct a covert operation: some good jokes here, if English offers a school with the Rock Academy spy-type.
The Englishman returned to White Hall to provide urgent information and played again with his long-suffering ex-partner Bo with Ben Miller.
Baugh is now a married man and has entered the service as a submarine commander, a role that has been somewhat lost in Happy Wood and Ice Hockey where Vicky Pepperrin is.
Thus, Batman and Robin are reintroduced by mistake into Her Majesty's Secret Service, and confront Ophelia Boltowa, the beautiful face of Ugla Kurlenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the spell of charismatic tech billionaires who claim to solve the UK's computer problems: the villainous Jason Weltacht played by Jake Lacey.
The Englishman and the poet begin their Odyssey with clownish high-profile adventures: they pose as waitresses and set fire to French restaurants; they beat themselves up and smuggle their luxury sailing ship the Volta; and the Englishman creates chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get inside the Volta home.
Of course, all the stops are meant for the last scene, but as lovely and exciting as it is, there's something about everything on children's TV.
You're such a mean prick.
And like all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role and really do justice to this talent?
Labour rejected a plan to allow Britons to work four days a week and receive five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week - but get paid five days.
According to reports, the party wants employers to pass on the savings from the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This allows employees to enjoy three days off on the weekend - but still return home with the same pay.
Sources said the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and aims to shift the country towards workers.
The change to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way to capitalize on the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times that a review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a dream that is in line with the party's approach to financial return to the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party will not be the first party to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging to create a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election.
However, this ideal is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not a party concern".
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell used a labour conference last week to raise his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless" and "seeking" managers in economic institutions.
Shadow Prime Minister schemes also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire shares, as the Labour government can make "reductions" for perceived infringement reasons.
He also stated that he intends to put workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector companies' shares to employees, which must be at a maximum of £500 per share annually.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, and 60 Minutes discuss whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could lead to any of the Republican senators withdrawing their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pley asked Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy of South Carolina appeared more open than his colleague.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course".
"I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanagh when I went to the hearing.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, he said, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, determined, forthright".
However, Graham's vote appears to be unchangeable.
He said, "My mind is full of the Burt Kavanagh affair, and it will be a high-risk charge".
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: He denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blassy Ford.
And all that call upon his name shall not be able to confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I'm not seeing anything new change".
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive lineup of performing stars and an equally impressive mission: ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pour into the vast Central Park lawn to not only enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free concert ticket (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees must do a series of things, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about the concert's goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in 12 years of achieving its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to encourage people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or by posting a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered over 19 million "steps" from its fans and wants to pursue various goals.
The report said that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notices resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funding provided has so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the power of nutrition, the involvement of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to "help children reach their full potential", and have pledged to provide $35 million in Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the state after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
In April 2018, Nutrition Power Ambassador Tracy Ullman, addressing the crowd during a live concert in London, said: "With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition as a thing of the past".
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to ask the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project called "Nutrition Power" that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
He was responding to a frequently asked question on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Muncy are among some of the performers at this year's ceremony in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee French and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could be used for "sea blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports  Interior Ministry
According to the Washington Post, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could use its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russia from entering markets including the Middle East.
Zinc claimed that Russia's conflict in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the legitimate invitation of the government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is because of their energy brokerage, as they do in Eastern Europe, they also broker in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to combat it.
"The United States has the capacity to work with our navies to ensure that the waterways are open and if necessary, blockade them so that their energy does not flow to the market", he said.
Zanky addressed the participants at a forum hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that bills itself as the "Voice of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's efforts in dealing with Russia and Iran, adding that these efforts are effectively similar to each other.
"The economic pathway for Iran and Russia is more or less a leverage and fuel substitute", he said, referring to Russia as a "trick horse", adding that its economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration, by replacing Russia, is working on its mission to increase its LNG exports to Europe and provide cheaper options for European consumers.
In this way, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to encourage Germany to back down from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a Russian slave.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to build the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a fully economic project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's staunch position against the project is only firmly grounded in economic reasons, and that it is an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after his meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow, "I believe we have a common view that steam cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers".
The US's involvement has prompted a serious reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Pioneering Foundation for Industry, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after the recent meeting between Angela Merkel, Prime Minister of Germany and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia: "I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously" consider running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously" consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Town Hall in Holyoke, Senator Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
According to Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild the broken government, and that's only possible if the leadership is female".
"I will consider running for president after November 6".
Pressuring President Donald Trump, he said during a meeting at the Shawarvale salon that "the country is heading in the wrong direction".
"I am worried to my bones what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Donald Trump and Britt Kavanaugh, his nominee to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of voters did not think Ganwer should run in the 2020 election.
According to a global poll by the Suffolk/Boston University Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts voters "probably" said the senator should not participate.
Thirty-two percent supported this participation.
The poll showed more support for participation from former governor DeWall Patrick, with the remaining 38% supporting potential participation and 48% opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with candidacy in the 2020 election included Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make a formal decision in January.
Sarah Palin on Donald Trump's campaign, referring to Palin's PTSD disorder
26-year-old Turk Palin spent a year in Iraq before being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son is going through, what he is going through with his return, I understand the families who are feeling the radiation of PTSD and the trauma that our soldiers are coming back from", she told the audience at the funeral for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said his son and other fighters "returned a little different but stronger, they returned feeling that what the soldiers and the Air Force and every member of the military have given to this country is respected".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Walesa Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering in a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
The District of Columbia and the State of Oregon are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims of domestic violence or crime.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a brief petition in Washington state court on Friday in support of a policy that challenges refugees.
The name of the complainant in the Grace V. Sessions claim that the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit in August against the federal fair housing policy, has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and their violent gang members" had harassed him, but US authorities rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are the countries with the highest number of asylum seekers to the United States, because they face gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants who had fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
General Carl Racine, Surgeon General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The petition summarized the court's "federal law requires that all asylum claims based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim be adjudicated, and such injunctions violate this principle".
Lawyers emphasized in the brief that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the U.S. economy had hurt, adding that they might be doing business and "providing the necessary wages".
A meeting of the General Staff in June ordered immigration judges to further refrain from granting asylum to those fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions, in his policy statement dated June 11, stated that "asylum is available to those who have left their country because of fear of death, based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social or political group".
Asylum has never been a solution to all the problems -- even the most serious ones -- that people face in their daily lives.
Rescue efforts in Palo doubled as the number of dead in search for survivors
The situation for the survivors was increasingly dire.
"It's a sad feeling", said Risa Qasma, a 35-year-old mother who was treating her feverish toddler at one of the evacuation centers in the city of Palo Alto.
"An ambulance will be bringing bodies here any minute.
Drinking water is scarce".
The inhabitants were seen to return to their ruined houses, to pull their goods over the water, and to try to save what they could.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties in the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Duo Harris, who had broken his spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palo Military Hospital, where patients were being treated for the severe and persistent aftershocks.
When he remembered the feeling of the tremor that shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter, tears came to his eyes.
"It was not time to save our lives.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the walls, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had gone into town for a wedding.
"I heard the lady crying for help, but then I heard the blackout.
I don't know what happened to him or to my son.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "mocking" by "advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper to promote mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a Chinese newspaper that paid supplementary fees to the state's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing sought to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of the campaign intensification by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has seen tariffs on each other's imports rise.
Chinese and American experts said that China's retaliatory tariffs were designed early in the war to target exporters in the states of Chao Phraya, which are backed by Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Bernstad, the US ambassador to China and a long-time former governor of Lao PDR, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling down on this ridicule by launching propaganda ads in our own free media", Branstad wrote in a commentary piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By cracking down on its propaganda", Branstaad wrote, "the Chinese government is exploiting the American tradition of free speech and our free media by posting ads on the Des Moines Register".
"On the contrary, in the low-key newsroom here in Beijing, you will see limited dissenting voices and no real reflection of the different views that Chinese people may have about the direction the economy is heading, including that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers was offended by the publication of his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans will alienate women voters from the Kwanzaa scandal ahead of midterm elections
While many Republicans are defending the position of Supreme Court nominee Britt Kwan-Woo from numerous allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that they will face a serious backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming election cycle.
The level of sentiment was quite high, with a large number of Republicans on the list indicating that they wanted to go ahead with the vote.
Grant Richer, a professor of law at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Law, said in an article that appeared on Saturday, "There can be no backsliding in these kinds of cases".
Richter said he was skeptical of Sen. Jeff Felix's last-minute attempt to say that the FBI investigation was sufficient to calm voter turmoil.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November".
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Number is coming!" as they passed the Senate corridor, as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee that elected Quanno to run, even though Dr. Christian Bissley Ford testified, according to Mace.
"Democratic enthusiasm and interest will be out of bounds", said Steve Rodinberg, an unbiased political analyst for the news site.
"People say he has already reached the heights, it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among urban female voters and younger voters, ages 18-29, who don't like the president, don't usually vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony about the details of sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans tried to endorse him, reactions might flare.
"This has created a huge uproar for the GOP", said Michelle Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's about the way Republicans have handled him", Guy Sencil, president of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told CNN.
However, Americans seem to have a somewhat more credible bias toward Ford and his testimony against Kavanaugh, with little bias toward Kavanaugh.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents either believed or were likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they either definitely or happily believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent of Fed said they thought Quana might or might not have lied during the testimony, while only another 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After efforts by Flake, the FBI has now begun its investigation into allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had molested him while he was 17 years old, while he was drunk.
Ramirez is accused of having her genital organs shown to her by a Supreme Court nominee while they were at a concert while studying at Yale, in 1980.
The discovery of the global Internet is planning to launch a new Internet to rival Google and Facebook
Tim Birner-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is taking his first steps towards competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech genius, Inrupt, is the company that builds the open source platform SolidBinary.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to access that data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Birners-Lee joked that her goal behind Inrupt is to "rule the world".
He said of his first steps, "We must do this now".
"This is a historic moment".
The toolkit uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
The store includes lists, to-do lists, genres, music, library and other personal and professional items.
It is available in the form of Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Silk, and Spotify, all in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online personal information stores is that it is entirely up to the user who can access the information.
The company called it "personal empowerment through information".
The Inrupt theory, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to pool resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now has Birners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform provided by IBM, a number of contractors assigned to work on the project, and a committee of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized widgets, using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Birners-Lee said that he and his team "do not talk about Facebook and Google about whether there will be a general shift, where other business models are completely created in the blink of an eye".
"We are not asking for permission".
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Birners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide business energy and ecosystem to help in the cohesion and quality of the new web created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee coined the term Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the neutral debate.
Even at the time of Inrupt's inauguration, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Information Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the new Web age", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vaughan: Celebration of the Victorian WW1 Crusade in Action
The award of the Victoria Cross in World War I, by the only Church of England priest to have been knighted, has been celebrated in his home town for 100 years.
Second Lieutenant Colonel Archduke Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Billinglis and Leighcourt.
However, he was shot dead four days later by a sniper, never knowing that he had taken the greatest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two sons-in-law to a performance at the Shropshire, Northumberland, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michel Van, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" and should have been displayed exactly 100 years ago, on the day his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van Gogh crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in thick fog and under heavy bombardment by the garrison".
He then went to the line of fire and advanced the line with "very great courage" before holding the gun in one hand and shooting three times to the side.
Colonel von was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michelle Vaughan, 72, said her grandfather's performance was "something I could never do, but it's humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughan also performed a flower bouquet after the performance, which was led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Band.
Michele Vaughan said she was "very proud of the feeling that this was the show", adding that "the courage of a true hero is shown with the support of many people".
MMA fighters stayed up all night to see Billature 206, but instead they saw Pippa Pig.
Imagine you waited all night to see Billitor 206, only to be prevented from seeing the original program.
The St. Hugh Bill consisted of 13 fights, with a total of 6 fights on the main card which was to be broadcast all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gigaard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were shocked when the live broadcast turned into Pippa Pig.
And there were some that were ill-disposed, and that stayed up all night until the morning, and watched the battle.
One fan on Twitter called the live-action adaptation of the children's cartoon "a nasty joke".
When asked about the transmission, Dave Squartz, Senior Vice President of Broadcast and Communications, said, "It was a government decision that the content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to broadcast the children's program".
""Ten pigs, yeah".
Scott Cocker, CEO of Biltmore, said they were working on time-sharing to keep the UK audience with them in the future.
"I think when I think about the answer, I think we might be able to solve it", said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this shift happened, I saw a lot of messages coming up and up, and not all of them were very friendly.
We were trying to solve this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's problem.
I can promise you that this problem will not occur in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of matches from six to five - as is the norm - and we've tried to show more matches to the fans, so the number of matches has increased.
This is a regrettable situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly feels 'promiscuous' about gender
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling humiliated in public because of his gender - but this encouraged him to take it upon himself.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't understand that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking to Radio 4's Desert Island, hosted by Lauren Lively, she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a father made him think less about winning an Olympic medal.
Christy Young, the daily anchor of the long-term program, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing on the first episode of Laverne as a solo performer, Deeley said that she felt "less than the others" growing up because "it was not acceptable in the community to love both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, it is that feeling of being inferior and feeling of being different that has given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove she was "something" so that everyone would not be disappointed with her until they knew about her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic medalist has been a major LGBT campaigner, using her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge other countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
She said she spoke about it because she felt happy to live without the rifts and wanted to give others "hope".
She, a three-time world champion, said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise".
Deeley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
She spoke about her first Olympics when she was 14 and her father died three years later, from cancer - "When you're young you have a lot of problems", she said, saying it was difficult for her to find someone whose experiences on the slopes and heights of life were similar to hers.
The couple had a son, Robert Roy Black-Deley, in June, who Deley said had "changed his whole outlook".
He said, "If you asked me last year, all I would have said was, 'Win gold.'"
"You know, there are bigger things in life than gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby".
Her son's name is the same as his father's, who died at age 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
The Daily said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked him was to buy my tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the first train.
He said, "I could not tell him that you would not live until you got on the train, Dad".
"I held his hand tight as he breathed and continued to do so, and when he stopped breathing, I finally knew he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Delhi participated in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life, to be diving in front of people at the Olympics, it doesn't feel better", she said.
This fact was also the inspiration for her first song - Proud on the Little Ponytail - which resonated with her in preparation for the Olympics and even now stands out with her body hair.

Mickelson sat out of style on Saturday, sitting in the Ryder Cup chair.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will tie the record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his style to avoid an unusual result.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Forick for his four-ball multiple on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as he usually did for the United States, the winner of the Big Five spent half his day as a cheerleader and the other half of his day working on his game, hoping for something that would help him.
Having never been a professional motorcyclist, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was never a good choice for the rugged Lee County Golf Course, where long, grueling affairs are the unpleasant daily punishment.
And of course the course itself isn't as scary, as Mickelson, in his ninth race on Sunday, faces the defending British Open champion, Francisco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win four races this week.
If the Americans, at the start of the 12 singles, come four points down and make a warm start, the Mickelson match could prove to be a real emergency.
Ferrick expressed confidence in her husband, not enough to say anything.
And he said, He knew his part this day, and laid his hand upon my shoulder, and took his arm from off my neck, and said, To-morrow he shall be ready.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is famous and has been very upset with these teams in the past and this week.
I may not have imagined him playing a match-fixing game.
I expected more from him, but that's what happened and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, like everyone else".
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most matches played on Sunday.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his highest solo record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferrick said his presence has brought tangible gains for the team.
He explained, "He's funny, he's sarcastic and funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy to have on the team".
"I think the young players have enjoyed their time on him, which is a nice thing to see.
He has given more than just playing".
Thomas Beuys, the European captain, knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a measured lead on the final day of singles competition in the Ryder Cup can easily lead to an uncomfortable path.
Dean made his debut in 1997 at Veldirma, where he was captained by Siu Basteros, who scored five points against the Americans but won the finish line by the smallest margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remember we were at the top level in Valderma; we were at the top level in Brooklyn where we lost and in Valderma we won, that's all", said Jorn when he was photographed after winning 3-5 of the 2018 class on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in going to the National League 6-10,
So history showed me and everyone on this team that it's not over yet.
You will be born again tomorrow.
Go and do all that is right.
It will not end until you have received your marks.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this prize, and that's what we need to focus on.
I've always said, I'm focused on the 12 players who play for us, but we also know who's standing in front of us - the best players in the world".
While pleased that his players had played hard on the golf course, Bjorn added: "I'll never stop myself in this.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow is a solo show, which is fine and something different.
It's great to be there with a partner and everything is going well, but when you're alone, then you're being tested for your full potential as a golfer.
This is the message which ye shall tell your neighbours; and ye shall make your best men to appear.
Yea, ye have left your fellow, and he shall go forth, and shall bring forth his goodness.
In contrast to Bujorn, Jim Firk, who is the opposite number, would have his players shine better individually than with a partner, expecting more from Jordan Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who scored three, including four.
Ferki himself performed extremely well at the end of the two days, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before suffering a loss as Europe pulled out of the "Miracle in Medina".
Asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, relied on his players to get to the final day, he said, "I remember every damn word of it".
"We have 12 important races tomorrow, but people want to go to the same fast start, as you saw in Brooklyn, or as you saw in Medina.
When the stage goes to a single track, there is a lot of pressure on the intermediate competition.
We're going to set our line up the way we want to set the players, you know, we're going to try to bring in a little bit of magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-fight and will face off in the higher race, with Rory McLaury, and in the semi-high races with the other Europeans, Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poehler.
"I chose this men's group in this way because I think it covers the whole course", said Jorn about the selections for the singles competition.
German warship once again postponed
Local media reported that the newest German Navy yard was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleship, but the ship will not be commissioned until next year due to problems with the system and the use of ice cannons.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, the launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the new Baden-Württemberg-class supercarrier, has been postponed until the second half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but post-transfer problems have caused the future of the large-scale project to be altered.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class ships.
They are expected to showcase powerful cannon, combined anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as a number of stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and reduced sound signals.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - this should make it possible to send the newest ships away from inland ports, for two-year missions.
Dai Zeit notes that, although, it is said that prolonged delays would mean that the battleships that would allow Germany to plan its own foreign missions would be obsolete by the time service began.
The unsuccessful F125 was among the headlines of last year, when the German Navy officially withdrew the ship from service and handed it over to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after it was transferred.
There is not enough information available on the reasons for the ship's withdrawal, but German media have cited a number of "hardware and software problems" that made it useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software inadequacy was particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be commanded by a crew of 120 men - only half the manpower that operated on the previous Bremen battleship.
Also, it turned out that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced the activity and limited the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship is being transported while weighing twice as much as the similar ship used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from inadequate hardware, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - was also problematic.
It is said to be priced at €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - €2.2 billion more than expected.
The problems with the newest battleship are particularly significant in light of recent threats to the downsizing of the German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was facing "a shortage of ships capable of going on missions".
The official said the problem has grown over time as the old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement has been ordered.
He explained that none of the battleships of the Baden-Württemberg-class were capable of joining the Navy.
National Trust listens to the mysterious life of bats
New research has begun at a Scottish Highlands centre to investigate how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of rare flying mammals and help pave the way for conversational activities of these creatures.
The study, commissioned by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelles, as well as brown-footed and dubinton bats at Inverare Gardens in West Rode.
Special recorders will be deployed at key locations in the park to record activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be working to launch mobile surveys using manual detection.
The expert's analysis of all recorded sounds will determine the frequency of the bats' conversations and which type of bat is doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be created to provide a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dior, Nature Dialogue Advisor for NTS, hopes the result will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each of their species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to preserve forests for bats and other species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across England have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by habitat loss due to construction and development activities.
North turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can toxic paper and a number of other chemical additives used in home construction, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind in principle.
Although, as a result of the nighttime hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes for the taste of food.
They use sophisticated habitats techniques to keep insects and other obstacles out of their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the existence of bats seriously.
The Foundation has trained 10 cashiers who conduct surveys, night inspections and sometimes rescue missions on a regular basis.
The Foundation has even created the first and only dedicated bat reserve at Trafford House in Demerridge and Galway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Building manager David Thompson says this is the place for their idea.
He said, "Here in Trife, we have created the best bat field".
"We have considered old buildings, a lot of old trees and all good habitat.
But there's a lot that's still unknown about bats, and the work we're doing here and at other foundations will help us learn more about what they're doing to succeed".
He emphasizes the importance of bat searching before building, as unintentional damage to a single nest can kill up to 400 female and juvenile bats and possibly their entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Fund, has encouraged people to help.
He said, "We still have a long way to go to know about bats and for so many species of bats, we don't even know what their populations are struggling with.
Ronaldo denies sexual assault allegations as lawyers prepare to file a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of sexual assault against him "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves using his name".
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Forward Portugal and Juentos were accused of sexually assaulting an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported to The Guardian on Friday that he was charged and later paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
While speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram live, 33-year-old Ronaldo reacted to the report, calling it "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that".
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well", the player added with a smile on his face.
"Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called reporting unacceptable suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christine Seertz said the player was seeking "moral damages in response to a serious breach that may be one of the more serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at the Pums and Quincy Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca reportedly went to the player's room, where he raped her from behind.
Miorga claims that Ronaldo knelt before him after the incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good man" and said to leave the other "one percent" aside.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted to having sex with the woman, but this was by mutual consent.
Miurga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her wounds taken at the hospital but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman said she refused the agreement because she had suffered trauma as a result of the incident.
Ronaldo was due to leave Manchester United to join Real Madrid at the time of the sexual harassment allegations, and in the summer of that year, he joined Italian side Giants Joffe for €100 million.
UK Brexit may be 'for ever' regrettable with loss of carmakers
Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said that if the UK lost its status as a global leader in car production after Brexit, it would "regret it forever".
He added that it was "a matter of concern" that UK Toyota told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border during a no-deal Brexit could lead to duty costs.
The Bernaston plant - which produces Toyota's Aris and Owens motorcycles - produced nearly 150,000 cars during the past year, 90% of which were exported to other Arab countries.
Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Brynston, said: "My view is that the UK will leave the EU by the end of March and we will see a production halt at our own factory.
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for the month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what the Gann Motor manufacturers say will be the risks to supply chains during a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is "very timely", with parts for the ordered cars being supplied from other suppliers in the UK and EU within 37 days.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal by 29 March, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of supplies.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to wait for more than days for the cost of its inventory at its late-stage plant and would therefore cease production.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "accurately calibrated to avoid these checks at the borders".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract so that we can, as we say, not only be a service provider for the moment but also take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"The response from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers is that we need to be fully able to sustain our supply chain successfully".
Toyota could not say when it would halt production, but warned that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and, consequently, the number of jobs.
Peter Svaleris, who has worked at the Bernaston factory for 24 years and is the organizer of the union at the factory, said that the union members are increasingly concerned: "Based on my experience, when these job opportunities are lost, they will not come back.
"We have presented a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU", a government spokesperson said.
White House says Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again
The White House told The Associated Press on Sunday that Trump's high-level meetings with Vice President Rod Rosenstein may once again be postponed for "another week" as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brit Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein is responsible for overseeing the work of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which assesses Russian interference in elections, Trump-Russia aid ties, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump would remove Vice President Louis Sarnoul, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a source of controversy in Washington for months.
In early February, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein's wearing of a mike to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment were discussed.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House on Monday, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was postponed to Thursday due to the President's participation in the UN Summit in New York.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford said Trump said he would "not prefer" to acquit Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of abusing him both testified.
On Friday, Trump issued a weeklong FBI investigation order against Kavanaugh's allegations, which also delayed the Senate's supplemental vote.
Trump's media secretary, Sarah Sandris, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about Rosenstein, he said: "The date is not yet set, it may be during this week, I can see that given all the things that are going on in the courtroom, it may be postponed for another week.
But we see and we always like to keep the media informed".
Some reporters may disagree with that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the information was not to the taste of TV reporters, and said it would "attract attention". "I don't object to the fact that the information was attracting attention".
He then said that direct media contact with Trump would increase.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, without providing evidence, "We look at the statistics".
Information will be provided, Sandris said, but "if the media has the opportunity to raise their questions about the United Nations directly with the president, it would be better to talk to me".
We will try to do that, and you have seen us do that over the last few weeks, and the session where you can talk to the president about the United Nations will be a press conference".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with other officials.
There are very few individual press conferences.
During the week in New York, the president showed reporters why by taking the media lightly and sometimes looking inappropriate.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Minister of State has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express the country's right to vote and to wish for post-Brexit.
Jane Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the relocation status applications for EU nationals working in the public sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in the letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal from the EU have been underway and are moving towards a decision expected in the near future.
But the UK government is still prepared for a possible no-deal scenario.
For I know that it is a time of trouble for you all.
That's why I wanted to tell you how much the contribution of every employee, regardless of their identity, is important to me.
Partners from across the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and skills to us that have strengthened and improved the performance of health services and have been beneficial to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is our home and we would love for you to stay".
Christine Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head wound
Mike O'Regan, representing the Tennessee Tigers, said Tennis State Tigers linebacker Christine Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Sunday's 27-31 loss to the Windsor Beetles.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the fans that he suffered a concussion shortly after halftime.
And Reid said, He came to the side line, and fell there.
Teachers and medical staff on the sideline gave him oxygen before putting him on a note and transferring him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the operating room of the Winderberht Medical Center.
Harris added that "more details about the type/size of the wound are not available", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Ambercrombie, a redshirt sophomore after transferring from Illinois, is in his first season with Tennessee State.
He had a total of five fights on Saturday, before being sent off, bringing his season's total to 18.
When buying a building in the UK, foreign buyers are liable to pay more tax.
Under the new Tory plan, when foreign buyers buy a building in the UK, they will be required to pay more tax and extra money to help homeless people.
This action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
Increased tax expenditure will impose a tax on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to increase to £120 million a year - to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged more tax when they buy property in the UK - with extra money coming in to help homeless people.
The action will be used as an attempt to counter Corbyn's criminal movement to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing while targeting high-income individuals.
The tax burden will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with an additional bridge that will increase the government's ability to deal with homeless people.
The additional costs - which are in addition to the current tax bill, including the high levels of costs incurred two years ago for second homes and permits to purchase - can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury is expected to increase to £120 million in one year.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings have been built by non-resident Londoners, which has led to higher prices and made it challenging for first-time homebuyers to step on the first floor.
Many of the country's affluent areas - especially in the city center - have been transformed into "ghost towns" by foreign buyers, who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for lower tax rates to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by raising land prices, saying they were not using them, and urged Ms. Mahmood to cancel the affordable housing quotas to solve the "rescue housing scandal".
Mr. Corbyn proposed a series of substantial housing reforms, including rent control and ending "no-show" evictions.
And he desired that the council should be given more power to build him new houses of habitation.
She said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the British dream, which is to make life better for each of the next generation.
And that means creating a broken market for shelter housing.
Brittany will always be open to those who want to live, work and rebuild their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that this is as easy for those who do not live in the UK as for companies based abroad to work hard in the UK.
The dream of buying a home is far from reality for many people, and the reality of homelessness is reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland President Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to lead Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot, who finished third in League One, just three points short of the top spot, was enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club.
He joined the Lightning this summer after guiding St Mirren to promotion back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won the B Cup and that was it", Day told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up as a child with my father, watching Scotland in Hampden and that's what always drew me back.
This opportunity will only come if, however, I win the club's administration".
The ancestors of the day as the rulers of Sunderland are Ishmael Nick Adcoat, David Moyes, Sam Alvaredes, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keaney, Gus Poit and Paolo di Canio.
The former Atlantic boss says he feels he is not afraid to pursue such names at such a big club, while he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this moment is measured by the scale of 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at the club, it is undoubtedly a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I may only see myself here successful if I win the club back with them".
Ross has been in the administration for three years, after working as a vice president at Dembarton and only 15 months at coach Gary Hertz.
He then helped the Alouettes avoid relegation to the third tier and the following season, he led St Mirren from relegation to the Championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his playing days at Slade, Hartlepool, Fall Creek, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He remembered the time when he was in charge of the elephant, "It was probably a real fourteen".
"I really believed that management was more for me than playing.
It's strange because I did well, and I made a good life for myself as a result, and I enjoyed a number of high positions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to endure week by week.
I still suffer from anxiety and work pressure but I feel like I'm in the right office.
I've always wanted to be an office worker, and now that I'm doing this, I feel like I've been more comfortable in my adult life than ever".

Surveys reveal that the best time to drink is 5.30pm on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased pub visits in Brighton but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July - but restaurant visits fell to 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant who complained about the figures, said: "The sustained sunshine and England's unpredictably long World Cup streak led to a July pattern similar to last June, with pubs seeing a 2.8 per cent increase except for restaurants which suffered heavy losses.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant business during June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and liquor stores had their strongest performances to date, more so than restaurants whose business had declined.
Restaurants were also affected by the presence of sunlight, although not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Alcohol sales across the bars and bars operated for the month, reached 6.6 percent and in restaurants fell to three percent.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM said: "These results are consistent with the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events are also major factors in outdoor sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent decline in sales year-on-year is especially painful in the presence of persistent cost pressures.
"A long hot summer could not have been worse for food service providers and time will tell whether we can experience lower temperatures in August to get the needed rest".
The overall sales growth across bars and restaurants, including those that have recently opened, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the brand list.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's Coffeer Screw Tracker Industry Sales Supervisor collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups totalling £9 billion, an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Over 20,000 high school students appeared on the fake-insta pages.
This news has raised fears about the sexual content being scanned.
Twenty percent of the students said they had an "original" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have created social media accounts that they have hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake-Insta" accounts - Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Fifty percent of students said they operate through their "original" accounts to show their parents, while also owning other secret accounts.
A mother who found out about her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that the teenager was asking others to "sexually molest me".
The study, commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds had two accounts and half of those did not keep their accounts secret.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers have been lured into creating an online space, where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elide Doyle will be the "Voice of Athletes" at the Atlantic Board of Scotland
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Atlantic Board of Scotland as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle, one of the most decorated track and field athletes and president of InBythe, saw the move as a good opportunity to mentor others into the sport who could benefit from his extensive experience internationally.
"Aylind Haile is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and the global athletic community and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him on stage", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute to Scottish sport and help guide the sector".
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is now a BBC pundit who was unable to walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I was unable to walk.
Doctors said only the passage of time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a painful task, but I was cured and learned to walk, and today I can do agility exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump announcement, which likened mothers to cows, divides online theories into two parts.
A breast pump company has split the online opinion regarding the announcement that mothers are milking cows with cows being milked.
In an effort to unlock what is being called the "first wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Gann, Elvie has released an interesting music video inspired by the announcement, showing the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance among a herd of cows to a song that goes like this: "Yes, I'll suck myself, but you won't see my tail" and "In case you haven't noticed that these are mammals, these are my breasts.
The song goes on: "Pump them, pump them, my love, I feed them, pump them, pump them, I make my women drink".
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of views, the video has garnered mixed reactions from viewers, many saying the announcement sheds light on the "monstrosity" of the dairy industry.
"To announce this production, using cows was a bad decision.
One wrote, "They need to get pregnant and give birth to babies like us in order to produce milk, except for their babies, who are stolen from them a few days after they are born".
The breast pump is inserted into the breastplate of the nurse (Elvie/mother).
Another person commented: "It's understandably hurtful for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to announce a breast pump for mothers to protect their babies?"
Another added, "What a far-fetched announcement".
Others have defended the announcement, with one woman even admitting that the song was "laughable".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still a teenager, I'd buy one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit of a crazy announcement, but I've deduced it for what it is.
One said, "This is a great product".
Another person commented, "It's an interesting announcement targeting women who pump (usually at work or toilets) and feel like 'cow.'
For it is not declared, nor given to judgment, nor to praise.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they are dancing with a pump on their chest.
The main idea behind the campaign is based on the perception that a large number of women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
Although the pump is completely closed, it has no cable or tube and is moved around inside the breastplate, giving the woman the freedom to take her children with her wherever she wants to go, even when they are pumped out.
Anna Bellarine, Partner and ECD at Mother, writes: "The lead pump is a revolutionary product worthy of such a bold and provocative opening.
By creating equality between female performers and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and all the challenges involved, while also portraying it in a fun way, by providing a sense of freedom that is created by using this pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvy pump has been the subject of media coverage.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two was seen displaying the product wearing Martha Jacobusky.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border by default
The number of immigrant children detained has intensified despite the consistency in border crossings, as the Trump administration's harsh tone and policies have made it more difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and fear that sponsoring a child could jeopardize their own safety in the country.
The threats intensified in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and adult family members would have to register their fingerprints and share this information with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Chief Matthew Albines was summoned to Congress because the agency had arrested a large number of individuals who had filed applications to sponsor homeless children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of these individuals, either sponsors or sponsors' family members, are living illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals", Mr. Albin said.
According to Schettler's work, authorities who want to get children into the process sooner have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within one month of detention, instead of the previous 60-day standard.
Many instead of being physically present, appeared in court via video call to present their petition for legal status before the immigration judge.
And the rest shall return, and shall not be ashamed.
According to shelter staff and reports that have circulated from the system over the past few months, the more children are in detention, the more they become anxious or depressed, leading to violent behavior or attempts to escape.
Lawyers have said that concerns are more widespread in larger foundations like Tornillo, where children who struggle are often thought to be overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to their friends could cause them the trauma that many of these children are already experiencing.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces' to withdraw immediately
In his statement to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'arram called on Syrian refugees to return to their homelands, even as the country's civil war enters its eighth year.
Melam, who continues to serve as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are present on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated as such".
And he said to the assembly, Let them go forth from me, and I will deliver them.
The teacher stressed that "the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue its "fight against this holy war until we have cleared our territory of terrorist groups and illegal foreign entities".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily tasked with advising and training Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
Around 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
On the issue of migrants, the teacher said that the situation is better for them to return and he accused "some foreign countries" of "scattering terror" to encourage migrants to leave.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian foundations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They politicize issues that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no structural aid to Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition at the end of the war.
UN diplomats say recent agreements between Russia and Turkey to create an interim zone in the area of the last major rebel group, Idlib, have provided an opportunity for negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey deal prevented widespread persecution by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where millions of people live.
However, Ma'ruf stressed that the understanding had "clear hurdles" and said he hoped to target the military operations of jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra fighters, to "behead them".
UN envoy Stephane de Mistura hopes the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government and undercover members, will begin to prepare post-war legislation for the series and pave the way for elections.
The teacher outlined the terms of government participation in the committee, saying that the board's work should be limited to "passing through the provisions of the current law", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the second round
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many libertarian commentators hope, impeachment and scandals do not end his presidency before the end of this term.
What is undeniable is that "this will be one of the most brilliant presidential endings!"
However, there is no sign of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings of 1.05 million have more than doubled on CNN and 1.6 million have tripled on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Richelle Mado" has the highest cable ratings of 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
Neil Bair, host of the ABC drama "The Designated Survivor", about a cabinet minister who becomes president after an attack on the White House, said "It's a fire where people are burned because it's not what we understand".
Neil Squeal, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Facts" has another theory about visiting the "Hollywood Kids Club".
He recalls a trip in a taxi in Boston, before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Ms. Squill said.
Here is a fun value in this mess.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the headlines coming out of Washington could shape the future of Weed, whether immigrant families can connect and shape the health of the global economy.
Setting is a boon that only the most qualified viewer can afford.
And yet, when you find yourself in a six o'clock panel discussion of experts talking about Bob Woodward's use of "after dark" in Wisch's horror, or the $15,000 Jumper, the leather ostrich (as the Washington Post put it, "a thick slice with Heber"), and the results of Storm Daniels' deceptive descriptions of Mr. Trump, um, his autonomy.
I, alone, would never see a Super Mario look the same.
"Part of what he does and what it feels like to watch a live show is he feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, president of Will House Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", which is a game-changer around Trump's show, where a new complexity occurs every day (he's at war with the N.F.L. every day, praising Kim Jong-un).
You don't want to miss a single section or be left behind.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week, during a sunny 80 degree day outside his home in the North Ridge Mountains, he was sitting inside his home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not avoid, not that Brett Kavanaugh was going to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and that the future of the Supreme Court was at stake on this scale.
"I remember when we started the madness program, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was a form of humor, but as it is today, they were expressing reality".

Out of the money flood in the narrowest domestic competition of the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts that included two factors for a single seat race.
The redistricting of the Pittsburgh suburb of Pittsburg was made by Corner Lamp, a Democrat who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is opposed to fellow candidate Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were rewritten following a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the former districts had been illegally merged in favor of the Republicans.
The 17th Movement has been driven by a financial campaign between the Majority Arms Movement, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC), and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after a minor victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was widely watched.
The seat had been held by Republicans for a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given a small margin to Democrats.
The United States pressed El Salvador to support China, which later withdrew, by sanctioning it.
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had previously recognized Beijing under some pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had an intimate meeting with Panamanian President John Carlos Varela and a hotel in Panama, after which the partners fired the Trump Foundation management team.
Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to repatriate the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent debate over the non-recognition of Taiwan".
However, sanctions were imposed only against El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including support for drug control, development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting off financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, may be painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As domestic meetings developed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow up on last year's meeting on the same issues, as a step in efforts to stop migrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted to hold a conference to conclude considerations of sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is expected to make a statement on the small reference to the agency's import deficit at the following conference, scheduled for mid-October.
And three American political envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, Dominican Republic in the absence of any harsh messages from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the debate that had been sparked by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss the internal talks on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst, who has close ties to the agency and has also agreed to speak on condition of confidentiality.
Study of history
The next boot to be dropped could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, which has already received significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mueller is also beginning his own investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was in league with Russia for attacking our elections.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable while preparing to go up against the voters and perhaps a jury.
This brings up a lot of why, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump - or his peers in Europe - is inevitable.
Here are the choices that must be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will affect how long the effort will take.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the West resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent years of carnage.
This historical trend is such that inflation and the unpredictable march of democracy either accelerate or slow down.
Americans are facing a lot of these inflationary issues.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Public Defender Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been boiling hot since the newspaper reported last year that he said he secretly recorded President Trump's voice and stirred rumors that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times's claims are incorrect.
"What will we do about the proposed new FBI investigation into Britt Kavanaugh if it is not fair - or if he is confirmed as chief justice despite the allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?"
And after all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress to hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will suffer a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported from Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had once occupied my apartment.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sunday candles on the table where the broken Nazi cross was placed.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Rangers is optimistic before the Vienna Rapids
Thursday's hosts Rapid Vienna, knowing of the Austrians' win after a draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Graham from making an appearance earlier in the season, to tie the score 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the results as a dive board for better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side", the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came back with a score.
Maybe we could have turned the game around at the end, but overall, the outcome was equally fair.
I think they were better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
As we head into Thursday, another big European night awaits.
We hope we can take three points from that but this will be a tough game because they have done well in their last game, but with the people behind us, I am sure we can try and get a good result.
Last year was really tough, with all that happened with my knee injury and the changes that have appeared at the club, but now there's a good feeling factor.
Our group is good and the kids enjoy it, and the education is good.
Let us hope that we may go on, that we may be able to pass the season and win.
Women are sleepless because of the pension reserves
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a number of people talked about it with their families.
Nearly half of those in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
Holly Snyder, the vice president of insurance business across the country, said, "People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to start this discussion".
You can start there.
Speak to your wives and children, saying, If ye do not set your right before them, how can ye be ready to provide for your household?
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, and those choices can be an important factor in determining cost.
Get your financial advisor: your financial advisor can help you to suggest ways to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term financing options can include a regular long-term insurance policy, a cash value combination policy to cover these expenses, or insuring yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Take your judicial papers, and arise, and arise to your judgment.
Get a healthcare proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your healthcare and ensure that professionals respond to your requests if you are unable to speak.
And thou shalt take a pledge for thy money.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that bills are paid if you cannot.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Place these details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the financiers that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan".
Man shot by air rifle in multiple IFRComb
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun as he walked to his home during the night.
The victim, aged 40, was in Oxford Grove Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting incident, which occurred at 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not very serious and police have been called to find witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
While the death toll is rising, at least 384 people have been killed by a quake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau as of Friday, officials said.
While communications facilities were down, relief officials were unable to obtain information about the area of Dongola, a region north of Palo that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
After the Palo disaster, more than 16,000 were evacuated.
A number of key facts about Palo and Dongola on Sulawesi are as follows:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow coastal strip on the east coast of Sulawesi Island with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
The Dongola area is located along the northeastern coastline of Sulawesi Island for about 300 kilometres (180 mi).
It is an administrative division of the province, with a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are important economic resources of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but much of it is located in Morouli, on the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesia Disaster Reduction Agency, Palo and Dongla have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongola.
Another tsunami hit Dongla in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Earthquakes and is often hit by earthquakes.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred in Georgia in recent years, including:
2004: A powerful earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Samarta, on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean and half as many in Aceh.
2005: A series of successive earthquakes rocked the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Neza Island, off the coast of Samarta.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook near Pudong, the capital of South Samatra Province.
More than 1,100 were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake shook the islands of Mintowa twice as strong as Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed numerous villages and killed nearly 300.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the Pedi Jaya area in Isfahan, causing destruction of homes and panic among the people as it reminded them of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami occurred this time but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Limbuk, Indonesia, killing 500 people in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed, thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Turk Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Pauline from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman she knew asked her to call the police and report the alleged crime, she took her phone away.
KTUU reported that Paulin was detained in the Met-Su building prior to the hearing and on the basis of a $500 secured bond.
The network reported that he appeared in court on Sunday, where he was asked if he would accept the charges, describing himself as "certainly innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He was also convicted of a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Paulin has been accused of criminal charges.
In December 2017, she was accused of raping her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic harassment, interfering with the reporting of domestic violence offences, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
And she that loved her took her for a lie, and smote her in the face.
After associating the abusive behavior of her son with the PSTD he contracted during his service in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by the ex-military group in 2016.
Indonesian tsunami: the voices are dead
Nearly 384 people were killed after a quake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise over the coming days.
The earthquake shook the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media show moments of the quake.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in Palo.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for suspected NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Cipolo Sipov, suspected of orchestrating the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Siphoff, 30, is accused of hiring a truck to carry out the attack on the motorcycle sidewalk along the Lower West Side Highway in Manhattan that led to the dismantling of pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalks in October.
According to the Notice of Intent to Execut, filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the conviction, prosecutors must prove that Sipov "internationally" killed eight victims and inflicted "internationally" serious injuries.
Based on court documents, both courts may issue the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of assisted murder, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in planned crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of vehicles.
While prosecutors called the attack "planned and deliberate", they described the sequence in which Sipov carried it out as "furious, brutal and corrupt".
The statement stated that "Sifolo Habibaalovic Sipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicolas Cleaves, Anne-Laura Dictat, Darin Drake, Ariel Irleigh, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagnoco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York executed anyone.
Defendant Khaled Bernez was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, showed less remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Sipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he continued to plead for ISIS to be fired on in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of criminal contempt.
David Patton, a federal public defender who represented SIPOF, said they were "truly disappointed with the prosecutor's decision".
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting his guilt and sentencing him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole would only prolong the damage to such incidents for all those involved", Patton said.
The group had previously asked the magistrates not to sentence him to death.
ToryMP says Nigel Farage should be appointed as the head of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today, during protests at the Tourist Conference, vowed to 'mobilize popular will.'
The former UKIP leader said politicians should have felt the 'heat of Europe's pessimists' - as one MP Theresa suggested she should be appointed as the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Boone, speaking at a rally in Birmingham, said that if Mr Farag had been Brexit minister, the UK would have 'separated from the EU'.
But the challenge Ms May faces in reconciling her deeply divided officials has been emphasised by the remaining Tories who have launched their own anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the war planning in check amid attacks from Brexiteers, survivors and the EU.
The allies stressed that he would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels, despite the reactions - and pressure from European pessimists and workers - to choose one of the 'between the shutdown and chaos' options.
Mr Boone told protesters that going out meant going out in Solihull, saying he wanted to 'throw away the chips'.
He suggested that Mr Farag should be appointed as a partner and be given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
He said, 'If he was the superintendent, we would probably be out.'
Wellingborough MP added: 'I am in favour of Brexit, but we need to get the checkers out.
While declaring his position against the EU, he said: 'We did not participate in world wars because we were dominated.
We want our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Boone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote. 'The theory that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.'
Brexit Minister Andrea Jenkin, who also attended the protests, told reporters: 'I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chakers are not popular among the people, the opposition will not vote, this is not common among the party and among our activists who took to the streets and voted for us at the first opportunity.
And now, I pray you, hearken unto us, and hearken unto us.
He added in a note to the lady: 'The prime ministers are keeping their position when they are fulfilling their commitments.'
Mr Farag told protesters that politicians should be forced to 'feel warm' if they are to rebel against the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about trust between us - the people and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to say to them, 'We will not allow you to do this.'
In a message to the crowd, he said: 'I would like you to force the political class on the verge of betraying Brexit to feel the heat.
'We will mobilise the people's strength of this country that won us the Brexit and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing and proud UK.'
Meanwhile, the Rimmers continued their demonstration along Bergam before their two-hour protest at City Centre.
A group of activists reacted to Torres by raising banners after the group opened during the weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Edwinez ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the start of the conference due to the party's widget.
'They are the ones who are telling us that they can have IT systems including all technology for Canada Plus Plus, for frictionless borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a complete imitation.
There is nothing better than a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren will 'think seriously' about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will 'seriously think' about running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a Saturday session at the Western Massachusetts Lounge.
Warren, one of President Donald Trump's frequent critics in the November re-election, has faced GOP state representative Jeff Dahl, who is Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign chairman.
He is under the spotlight of speculation that he may be in the 2020 Trump article.
The occasion was Saturday afternoon in Darollevuk, Trump's 36th meeting with lawmakers since taking office, using the Tone Hall format.
One participant asked if he planned to run for president.
Verne responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and rebuild the broken government, and for that, it takes a woman in leadership".
An arrest has been made in connection with the shooting and killing of LSU Sims.
Police in Beton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Semiz has been arrested as of Friday.
The Beton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson on the 20th at 11am ET at a news conference.
They broadcast a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
Police Chief Murphy J. Powell told 247 Sports on Saturday that "Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died from it".
And he came forward to his friend, and he smote him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and admitting that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Parish of Beton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 teenager who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims appeared in 32 games with 10 starts during last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per contest.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team's set-up won him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that on Saturday, Valter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton and that Mercedes would play a big part in the race.
From the start of the bat, Bottas got off to a good start, almost escorting Hamilton into danger while defending his position on two laps and allowing Whiteley to attack his teammate.
Whittle Nest went to the Goals and left Hamilton to run on the backpack through the Bayou, which was bound to happen.
Mercedes later descended from the range and Whiteley appeared behind, but Hamilton went ahead after a few wheel-to-wheel actions that saw the Ferrari driver leave the infield with a high risk, after a double move to defend the third corner with negligence.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the building and completed the seventh runway at the end of the first runway during his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a big part of the race, as he focused on his tyres to make a quick finish and move into fourth place, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen.
He also went into the pit pit pit pit of the 44th but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight pit pit pitches because Rickonin was on the fourth pit pitch.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a decent man to let me.
The team did an exceptional job of making us a seed of two", Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting on keeping a letter from Christine Blasi Ford that accused Supreme Court nominee Britt Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While addressing marchers in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad, dirty and wrong".
He said, "What's possible and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the violence, when you see people are violent, dirty and unfair".
"When you look at the magazines and the newsletters, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make a disclosure?
Remember his answer -- did you release the document?
Oh, no. I was just wondering.
I didn't disclose it".
So, wait a minute.
Did we disclose... No, we didn't", he added, imagining the senator.
A letter sent to Finnstein in July detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford was leaked in early September - but Finnstein denied the leak by his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, but I did not disclose his story", Hill reportedly told the committee.
And he said unto me, Keep it secret; and I kept it secret, as he said unto me.
But his denial didn't seem acceptable to the president, so he spoke about it during the Saturday night march. "I'll tell you one thing, that was a bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using the charges to their advantage.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see their post, their dirty, they don't think about who they're hurting, who they're going to put on their feet to gain power and control", MediaWiki reported from the president's mouth.
League of Legends: Dundee Stars 3-5 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Runny.
The Dundee Stars, who played in the Elite League on Friday, lost to the Belfast Giants, who won the replay on Saturday at Dundee by a score of 3-5.
The Giants scored two goals early in the game, via strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuys.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie took the ball to their own side before the Ducks won the Giants.
François Bouchard scored a run for a duck before Lucas Lundwall's goal ensured Nielsen won them.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came back on Friday night to beat Dundee 1-2 in Belfast.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two sides, with the Giants taking a three-game winning streak.
The opening goalkeeper came on in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with the help of Kendall McFaul, who was assisted by David Rutherford when Bickler scored the second goal four minutes later.
During a busy start, Sullivan re-entered his side in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt made a curve equaliser in the 15:16 minute.
When he scored his second goal at the end of the first period, Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead during the first half.
The group was re-established and Boward, in the 27:37 minute, once again put them in a strong field goal in a level condition.
Kony and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Mills score the first goal late in the second half, and he ensured that he would also score the fifth half-way point of the final period.
The Gaines, who have lost their last four matches, will face Milton Keynes in Friday's match.
Air traffic controller dies but ensures hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he ensured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could safely take off from the runway.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing as a result of the earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to shake the area, and large numbers of people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palo.
But despite his teammates fleeing the scene to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gnawan Agong refused to flee his duty at the Ossan Control Tower at El Joffrey Palo Airport.
He remained there to ensure that BatticAir Flight 6321 which was at the airport's runway, flew safely.
He jumped from the traffic control tower after thinking the code would fall.
He later died in hospital.
ABC News Australia reported that Indonesian Air Traffic Control spokesman Johannes Serrat said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikappan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
But unfortunately we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palo.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about this", he added.
This is while authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Reduction Agency says access to the towns of Dongla, Sigyi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll seems to be still rising as many bodies are still in ruins while many are still unaccounted for", said agency spokesman Sotopo Porovo Nogruho.
A wave of up to 20 feet (6 meters) in height devastated Palo, which mass-buried the bodies on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft transport aid and materials.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are moving bodies any minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being robbed everywhere".
Jen Gilfand, president of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors but we don't know what we're going to get there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I would ask you all to work day and night to complete any evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550.
Micronesia plane crash: New Guinea Airlines says one man has gone missing after the Laguna plane crash
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific basin in Micronesia, said one man had gone missing following earlier reports of the safe evacuation of 47 passengers and crew from the sinking aircraft.
New Guinea Airlines said in a news release that it had not been able to locate a male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the trace.
The company did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and flight crew after the plane hit water while attempting to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital as of Saturday and all were in good condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
The United States Air Force and Navy said the plane crashed in the lagoon due to lack of airport bandwidth.
Some witnesses thought he went beyond the airport runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went too low.
"That's very good", said Janis.
Jennings said he and others managed to get through the water, which reached to the waist, to the exit gate of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew were terrified and screaming and he took a small head wound from the area.
The United States Navy said sailors were working nearby to repair the waterfalls and also helped rescue passengers using a wind-up craft and transport them to shore before the plane sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Route Safety Network shows that 111 people have died due to crashes involving PNG registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of these crashes involved New Guinea Airlines.
Analysts provide a timeline of the night he was burned alive
Prosecutors concluded the case on Saturday with a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The President was certified as a witness in the intelligence analysis department for many hours.
He provided the panel with a timeline of how he used phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defense attorney Quinton Tillis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers during the night she died.
Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett, contradicting his earlier statements, said he had obtained local information from a large number of cell phones that showed Tallis was having dinner with Chambers on the day of his death.
When information showed that his phone was ringing during the time Chambers said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tillis was telling the truth about his claim that he was in Larry Sanford's apartment that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my Larry was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tallis said he had known Chambers for two weeks prior to his death.
Mobile phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tillis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
Hall said, "He took Chambers out of his life".
He defended his final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to be transferred to the panel later that day.
Hayward: What is informed hip-hop?
A hip hop artist seeks to challenge negative stereotypes about the genre by enriching his music with a positive message.
Hayward of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its original intent to convey political messages and fight social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop famous once again.
Artists such as Fugges and Kammen have witnessed a revival of the art in England through artists such as Acala and Lucie.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after "discriminatory" message
A New York nanny complains of a couple who discriminated against her, firing her after receiving a misleading message from her mother about her complaint that "she was another black person".
The pair dismiss this statement as discriminatory and seemingly analogous to "coercion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed dismay that her new babysitter, Gisele Marrick, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flexman said to her husband in a message, "No, another black person".
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Morrick twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his mistake, Plasco-Fulksman "dismissed" Ms. Morika, saying that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had performed poorly and that she was going to have a Filipino nanny instead.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home by Uber taxi.
Morris now sues the couple for damages - his dismissal from office and $350 per day for six months, which he was assigned to, without a contract.
He told Skin on Friday, "I'm going to show them, look, don't do this", and added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple reacted to the allegations by saying they were not discriminatory and added that terminating Morris's employment was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him after the abuse.
And he said, My mistress hath sent me words that I should not say in the letter.
He is not discriminating.
We are not a discriminatory people", Ms. Placko's husband, Joel, told Skin.
Will thou give thy children to the man that hateth him, and to him that is wicked?
The child of your own child?
Let's do it again".
While describing the situation as "compulsive", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby two months earlier and that she was "in a difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the case was going on, the court of public opinion was quick to announce the pair on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter indicates that publisher Gunn Paddington expressed concern that Gunn's singers would not be able to communicate with Bear Speaking.
The letter states that Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, was born shortly after the book was accepted. "It is a problem to step into the boots of someone who reads it for the first time, before it is published.
It's interesting to know what we know about Paddington's great success".
He said his father, who worked as a filmmaker with the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a little bear, may have thought his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom he calls "a very important member of his family", he said his father was quietly proud of his ultimate achievement.
He said, "He was a very calm man and not an energetic person".
"But because Paddington was so real to him, the situation was almost like having a child who accomplished something: You were proud of him, even though you had no part in it.
I think he had massaged Paddington's success in a way that was similar.
"Although it was his creativity and his vision, he always gave Paddington the credit".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After being placed on the ground, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Ned called again and again to say that he was not expected to do this", said Mrs. Ednan Laperoz.
"Then I got a phone call from Ned saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I am coming to you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors had given him slowed his heart pumping until his system finally stopped.
He had been dead for some time and his system had been shut down.
I would have sat and waited, and I knew that it would come to pass.
I couldn't scream, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I had to keep my feelings to myself".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapyrus, drowning in the agony of losing her daughter, sat down on the floor with the other passengers - it's clear what she was going through.
He said, "No one knows".
And I bowed my head, and my eyes were filled with tears.
It's very difficult to express, but I was on a flight when I felt a deep compassion for Ned.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Victim post card to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on BridgeWelsh so people can call those numbers for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Taylor, was 13 when he suffered from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day".
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a dedicated cook with a beautiful smile.
"She was known for her smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room".
Yet he left his office before he died, for he was "in a place of deep darkness".
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the first to see his brother commit suicide.
"I was persistently concerned that a secondary effect was occurring", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend of yours.
Don't sit quietly - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphreys, who had been a lifelong friend of Ms. Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt choked or worried or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his appearance.
"She was very quiet on Christmas Day - when the kids opened the gift boxes, she didn't even look them in the eye or anything".
She said that her death was a huge blow to her family but they had to fight the situation: "It has created a rift in our family.
He has divided us.
But we have to face it and fight it".

Kavanaugh's future is on hold as the FBI begins its own investigation
"I thought that if we could get something in principle, like something that he requested to be time-limited, limited in scope, we could maybe create some kind of alliance", Mr. Flick said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "get separated" during the partisan crackdown.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hatred is all just for the time being.
The midterm elections are scheduled to take place in five-week intervals and are set for November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans perform poorly, then they will be severely hampered in their efforts to elect a man to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report?
A vote will begin in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kwanzaa will be able to win at least 50 percent of the vote in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to win an equal vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean fugitives 'reduced' under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-seog, citing information from the Southern Union Ministry, said the number of fugitives last year will reach 1,127, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter controls on the border between North Korea and China and high smuggling rates for people have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
South Korea grants citizenship to the vast majority of North Korean refugees.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of these individuals flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is relatively easy to cross due to the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China recognizes fugitives as illegal immigrants in exchange for refugees, and usually forces them to return.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved over the past months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met for Pyongyang pain talks, which focused on nuclear disarmament talks.
The statement came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on terms to advance work toward a nuclear-weapon-free Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the subsequent U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without the full faith and credit of the United States of America, there would be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr. Ray said during his statement at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britt Kwanua "stereopathically ill" and says she is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Britt Kavanaugh "stereopathically ill" and said she was not well-suited to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman did that, they would consider her 'vulnerable to the ester disease.'"
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes even cried and coughed when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also openly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "an inappropriate and coordinated character assassination planned by liberals in their defiance of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election".
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to serve as chief justice because his testimony showed he was biased against Democrats.
He said, "I think that by expressing the same statements and manner in which he spoke to the Clintons and the Democrats, he was disqualifying himself".
Pelosi refused to answer a question about whether he would call Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the BFI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, he's not fit to be on the court that he's on now".
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pilocki added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions about whether he would reverse the court's specific decision.
Pelosi said, "It's not the time for people with asthma, for people with prejudice, to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'"
And we need women to work on it.
It's a true criticism, months and years of anger and he still can't get it out without crying.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later, "When we are defeated, we cry".
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "A woman helped me a lot, where she was an executive, who said she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she was angry, and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm choking, because I'm crying.
I am the force".
And then he went on like this.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are considered an excretion because they are so misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of one of my early assignments in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself confronted with what I described as unbridled rage, was when a woman older than I grabbed me by the scarf - an angry manager I had always been somewhat afraid of - who dragged me into the cells.
And he said unto me, Let not thy weeping be seen.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think you're dumb, and they'll be happy about it, because that's what they wanted".
Patricia Schroeder, who later ran for Congress as a Representative from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was ousted from the race after being caught in an illicit affair on an outer-space ship called the Menkeys, Ms. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, finding that there was no reason why she should not run for president herself.
He told me 30 years later, with a laugh, "That was a bad decision to think".
"There were seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was to add one more candidate.
And he called its name Snow-white, and the seven dwarfs.
When he joined the campaign later, he was behind in securing funding and therefore vowed that he would not get into the business unless he received $2 million in funding.
It was a losing battle.
She found that a number of her patrons who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
He asked, "Do they think I'm getting a discount?"
When she made the announcement that she would not be launching an official campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions - gratitude to those who would support her, frustration with the system that had made it difficult to secure funding to target voters in return, and anger at gender discrimination - that choked her.
Ms. Scordire recalled how the media reacted to her, "You might have thought I was experiencing a nervous breakdown".
"You might have thought that Clinx was the financier of my company.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my headstone?
"Did she cry?"
The US-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
Experts say the initial pretexts for the trade war between the United States and China were overblown, and while the war is far from over, a scratch between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year, by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant intensification came with new tariffs this week affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will affect all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded with kind words each time, most recently with tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to react to any action by the United States, and it is unlikely that this will have a negative impact on the world's second largest economy any time soon.
Washington's withdrawal from the action would mean a falling back on demands, but kneeling before the United States in the presence of the world would be a shameful act for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing acts properly, the U.S. trade war with China could be positively supported in the long run, by the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that could lead to collapse in one of these countries could be more dangerous than previously predicted", said Abigail Grace, research associate at the Center for a New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' for migrants to return
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'arram said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, his stable situation is safer, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorism to restore normalcy.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary return of migrants who have been forced to flee the country due to terrorism and the economic uncertainties that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'mur said the Saudis would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that have funded the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA, with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5, at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup tournament in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Toms Bjørn reached the 14.5 needed to defeat the United States.
USA star Phil Michaelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, shot three shots in par-3 water on lap 16, which resulted in the match being awarded to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all formats of the game, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Jordan Spit defeated the American by the lowest placed European player, Torbjorn Olsson of Denmark, with 5&4.
John's greatest player, Dustin Johnson, took 2nd and Ian Poulter from England, in what may have been his last Ryder Cup match, took 1st.
Former Ryder Cup eight player, Spaniard Sergio Gracia was voted European all-time winner with 25.5 points in his career as a player.
"I usually don't cry, but today I couldn't stop crying.
This year was very difficult.
I am so grateful to Toms for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have won the trophy again.
It's about the team, and I'm so happy I could help", said the emotional Grice after the European championship.
He passed the torch to fellow countryman John Ram, who beat the US golfing superstar Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in Sunday's singles.
Rahm, 23, said, "It's an incredible honor to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching this guy's matches".
Woods lost all three of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Red Cup career.
A curious figure is one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find their way out throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
This morning, we're going to set fire to Europe.
We threw it around.
Good for you.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players shone well.
We're going to rebuild the group, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee again, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to serve as their captain.
And ye shall wear the point of your caps.
We're ahead of the game".
News of the Red Mountains: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decline in the concentration of redfish in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, fragmentation has been reported in Penellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting decreased concentration.
The Red Mountains and Island Gorges cover approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Peninsula to the southern Lee Counties.
The fragments can be seen 10 miles from the coastal ridge of Hillsborough County, but some of the sightings date back to the past week.
Isles and moats have also been observed in the Pisco Peninsula.
Average concentrations in Pinellas County's marine areas were reported during the past week, low-to-high concentrations in Hillsborough County's marine areas, high-to-precursor concentrations in Manatee County, high-to-precursor concentrations in Sarasota County's marine areas, medium-to-precursor concentrations in Charlotte County, high-to-precursor concentrations in Lee County's marine areas, and low concentrations in Cooley County.
There are ongoing reports of respiratory burns in Pinellas, Mante, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory burns were reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
