The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast to Bangladesh and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halophyte swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/marshy areas.
Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
