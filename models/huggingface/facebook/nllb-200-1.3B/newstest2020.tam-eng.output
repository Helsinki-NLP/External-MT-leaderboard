The President said that the major challenge in the journey towards development is that the majority of people in politics, science, technology and research do not think about the country but only about themselves. He said that the country is losing the education needed in engineering, medical and accountancy services because the scholars who get free education are leaving the country thinking only about themselves and not about the country.

Many people have complained about this and they do not seem to have realized that they are thinking about an alternative or that they have a solution.
The only real solution is if I do what I believe people will follow.

It has been going on for six months and now it is becoming a habit.
I am now very happy mentally".

So my wife and I took a basket of bananas and went to the market.
I realized that it could be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people are not in good health these days.

The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh from 6 years to one year and one month.
This has removed the impasse in the contest of the by-election.
The Lok Sabha elections were held along with the Sikkim Assembly elections.
The Sikkim Grindikari Morcha won the election.
The party leader Prem Singh Dhang took over as the Chief Minister of the state.
But in 2016, a lower court sentenced him to prison for a corruption case.
This was confirmed by the Supreme Court and he was sentenced to jail.
The controversy erupted as he was sworn in because a corruption prisoner could not contest elections for six years.
He is contesting the Sikkim assembly by-election.
Thamang is in power in Sikkim with the support of the BJP.
Meanwhile, Tamang had sent a letter to the Election Commission, pointing out various legal provisions and demanding the lifting of the six-year ban on him from contesting the elections.
The Election Commission, after considering the letter, has announced that the ban on Tamang will be reduced to one year and one month.
This does not prevent him from contesting the assembly by-election.
The BJP can now start playing its politics in other states including Tamil Nadu, using the concessions given to Dhang.
The Election Commission and the report may be issued in full compliance with the BJP's wishes.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not merely a matter of admiration that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thereby to Indian politics.
We can still see the popular opinion that revolutionaries are just fools and petty criminals who do not care about human lives.
The Bhagat Singh era reminds us of their humanity, clarity and capability.
After the April 1929 Assembly bombing, the name of Bhagat Singh spread in India.
He made his public debut in 1930 after a brief stint in Tamil Nadu.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most astonishing news in history, that no leader born in the North, including Gandhi, has spread his name in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
And it was because of Father Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh's murder, an editorial titled Bhagat Singh appeared in the Republic Weekly.
The editorial praised Bhagat Singh's character interests and commented on the political situation of the day.
Some excerpts from the article:
'Indeed, if Bhagat Singh was so convinced that all his principles were right and the patterns he followed were the right way to carry them out, then we would say that he should have acted exactly as he did, and we would not say that he was a decent man if he did not.
So now we're going to call him a real man.
It is our strong impression that India really needs the Bhagat Singh Principle.
This victory would not have been so popular if Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and then died alive.
And we can say that if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhi would still have been alive.
Why did a mother who was willing to die for her own sake, who was sick and had to die in ashes, give her life to show the Indian people the way to real equality and peace for the people of the world?
We extol Bhagat Singh with heartfelt, generous and generous praise, as a supremacy that no other ordinary person can achieve!"
This is what Father Periyar said in the Republic edition.
Police officer Dennis Turner, who was on duty at the school where the incident took place, has arrested a girl who was smoking in the school for hitting a teacher.
The girl's hand was tied with a plastic tag and taken to the Juvenile Assessment Center in a police car, where a photograph of the girl holding a nameplate was taken, similar to the one taken for offenders.
His fingerprints have also been taken.
The girl's family was informed and she was handed over to her family.
It is not known whether he took the other child to the police station.
Her grandmother Kirkland, who agreed to reveal the identity of the girl, told the media that her granddaughter, who suffers from sleep apnea, sometimes suffers from the effects of medication.
I was shocked to hear that he was arrested for that, and said that it was difficult for any six-year-old child to understand and explain.

According to the report, the nuclear power sector has declined from 17.46 per cent of global energy demand in 1996 to 10.15 per cent in 2018.

The Vikram Lander landed on the plain between the two faces of Simbe Lius N and Mancinus C.
Analysis of these images confirmed that Vikram landed on the ground with a high impact.
That's why it went down a little bit further than it was supposed to.
John Keller, NASA's Deputy Director of the AROC Project, said, "The LROC orbiter passed through the South Pole of the Earth on the 17th.
The government has sent pictures taken in the evening.
The probe was found to have hit the ground with a force of about 200 pounds.
However, the exact location of the landing of Vikram lander has not been determined.
The LROC R Pitter will again pass over the South Pole on 14th of next month.
The lighting will be good, so there is a better chance of capturing Vikram".

Our leader, M.K. Stalin, had expressed his concern as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly that the A.D.M.K. Government had no concrete plan to stop the Kaveri crossing.
Speaking to the Chief Minister, Edappadi Paliniswami thought that he was answering the Chief Minister's question, asking, "Did the DMK, who is blaming us, build a checkpoint in Kaveri during their rule?"
"I want to inform him that under the DMK regime, we have built a detention centre at Kaveri in Mayanor under the Ganga regime.
Without knowing that, can Chief Minister Edappadi Palinchami, who has also taken charge of the Public Works Department, speak beyond the truth?
The dam at Mayanoor increased the water level in the area.
So farming flourished.
Thousands of farmers of the area, who are still benefiting from this, can be seen thanking the Government of the State for their efforts.
The dam was built by the Government of Gujarat in Mayanoor in accordance with the requirements of the time.
At that time, there was no need to build more dams.
If necessary, the artist, who was the Chief Minister at the time, would have given immediate permission, allocated funds and accelerated the work.
Therefore, it is not even close to possible to blame the KNU government for maintaining Kaveri's welfare.
I ask you, how many dams have you built in Kaveri in the last eight years of the DMK rule?
Another question is that during the DMK rule, we built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.
Can you name one dam built during the last DMK regime?
Don't lie to me.
If the opposition leader is not answering their accusation, then tell them with proof that we are building or planning to build a dam in these places.
Apart from that, I am obliged to point out that to say that no blockade was built in Kaveri under the DMK is not a polite thing, if you want it for your personal reasons, it is not polite for the post of Chief Minister you are holding.

The excavation of the 5th stage below marks a turning point in the study of the Sangha period in Tamil Nadu.
The valley was a fertile area from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.
The study is based on the available evidence on the urbanization of the Vaishali River basin.
The scientific dating of the excavations at the bottom has concluded that the Tamil-Bramite period was 100 years older. The study shows that Tamil was a literate society as early as the 6th century BC.
The samples from 70 skeletons extracted from the study have been sent to the Deccan College of Postgraduate and Research for scientific analysis.
The analysis of these stems was characterized by the identification of the species of tamil, buffalo, ram, wild boar, kalaiman and mule.
The study also found that the animals, such as cows, deer and goats, are used for agriculture and for food, as they have been found in some of the animal species, such as the Kalaiman, the Wuladu and the Wild Boar.
The analysis concluded that the Sangakkal society, which was primarily agricultural, also had livestock.
Samples of brick-lime-based roof tiles and clay-coated textile have been sent to the Vellore Technical University for analysis.
Each of these contained minerals such as silicon, lime, iron, aluminum and magnesium.

Is the BJP taking over the root caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
It is said that if the Tamil Nadu government is unable to keep the hammer and chisel blooming, then the BJP will eventually take over the politics of caste.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, Tamil Nadu was in a situation where the tamarind was left to dry.
For the second time, during the last parliamentary election, Amitsha said, 'You don't know what to do.
But in all the five contested seats, the ground was covered.
The BJP is being chased across the country but the opposition is still raging in Tamil Nadu.
It is above all about triple talaq, Kashmir issue, Hindi stuffing, one nation one language.
And it's all put together, and it's still in the gut.
This is why the BJP leadership is so angry at the Tamil Nadu BJP executives that it is still difficult to appoint a state leader.
On the one hand, the BJP is planning to somehow root the BJP in Tamil Nadu by the time of the upcoming assembly elections.
It seems that the BJP leadership has come to a conclusion through direct field report, intelligence report etc.
Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of the respective communities that the two Dravidian parties, whether Adygmukh or DIMK, do not give enough importance to the people of the Nahar caste, the Vanni caste and the Devendra clan.
It is also said that the Dravidian parties are saddened by this.
This is the very idea that the BJP has started to use as a tactic.
It is a matter of honoring a position that gives pride or importance to the respective caste.
The appointment of Tamil Nadu Governor Saundra Rajan is one such occasion.
Similarly, the BJP government is also reportedly giving priority to senior officials at ISRO.
If the BJP acts in such a way that it honours every caste, then it will bring pride and happiness to the people of that caste.
And, in any case, this caste policy is a matter for the BJP.
At the same time, while Tamil Nadu is already falling behind in caste politics, it is unclear whether these activities of the BJP will be like pouring more oil on the burning fire.
If the caste fire starts burning, then the same fire will burn even the little bit of tamarind that is now blooming in Tamil Nadu!

This has sent a message to the world that Kashmir is India's internal affair.
