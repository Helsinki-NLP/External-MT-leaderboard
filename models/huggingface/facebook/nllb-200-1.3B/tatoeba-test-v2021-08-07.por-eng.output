White: tower at a1, pawn at b6, king at c8. Black: pawns at a7 and b7, king at a8, bishop at b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by throwing the tower at a6, after which Black will have only two options: take the tower at a6 or throw his bishop to any other house on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and makes a tie. In the second, White tower takes the black pawn from a7, with identical result.
