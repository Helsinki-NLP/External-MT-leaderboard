How long have these symptoms been happening?
All cases of pain in your chest especially in your age should be treated in such a way
with fever,
and your cholesterol blood pressure should be checked
And do you have fever right now?

But there's a more important problem now it's chest pain.
But I find it difficult to breathe.
But I know that many people eat on me
But we need to treat each chest pain fully
But you're breathing right now?
Because of my pain in this chest, I completely forgot
Does it feel that someone is pressing your chest
Do you still feel breathing?
Do they complain of being ill with similar symptoms?
Do you have any other permanent problem like high blood pressure or anything like that?
Do you have any other long-term medical problems like diabetes?
Do you have trouble breathing with pain in your chest?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have some problems with it?
Do you know what his symptoms were?
Do you see an image?
A lot of liquid substances today
However, I make tests of diabetes
although its symptoms are similar to mine.
How high is your fever?
What's your blood pressure?
If you have a high fever,

I'm going to send you an image
I'm feeling a little pain in the chest today.
I have a little headache and a little fever today.
It's flu in my opinion
I think it's a light flu
Does it look like a heavy person on your chest?
It started with headache and there was fever at the same time.
It's causing pain between my chest
It's like an pressure pain in the chest
It's in my chest
It's in the middle of my chest
It's in the middle of the chest
The pain in my chest

like high blood pressure or diabetes
like in the middle of the chest
Now for fever you can take a sweet fluopina
Now Mary has shown you how long you've been
Now you said that your chest is pain
Sometimes I feel slight pain in the chest
Okay, do you have any other symptoms besides pain
Or do you think someone's sitting on your chest?
To a large extent it is similar to fever and cough pain in muscles
Right in the middle of my chest,
Show me on an image where you feel pain
since you have fever
So do you think some of these symptoms are related to pregnancy?
So there's something similar in your kids?
Tell me about pain in my chest
The fever increases during the night
The fever that I have since last two days
The fever began to grow overnight.
I'm Dr. Porter in the emergency room Triiz Centre.
Can you tell me something else about pain in your chest?
I feel pain in my chest here in front of my body
is getting acute pain in my chest.
when my chest pains
What kind of pain do you have in your chest?
When did this pain start in chest?
Where's your chest pain?
where do you feel the pain of this chest
You feel trapped in your chest
I want to tell you that I have diabetes
You said that you've got this pain in your chest
European Union / European Economic sector and United Kingdom▁ओरonnis disease rapidly increased from January 1 to 15th March 2020
Coronnis disease(COVID-191) is increasing in European Union/European economic area, countries and the United States which confirm that there are different stages on the basis of country, COVID-1919 epidemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
On the basis of experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and deep care units should raise their preparation for rapid growth in the patients of COVID-19 who need health care, particularly care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of infectious diseases which are unknown were referred to as Vajuhan, Hubi Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China has now referred to Nowell Koonanis, which is now referred to as severe severe severe respiratory syndrome(SARS-PV-2)(SARS-V-2) as diabetic.
Since then, the name of the disease caused by SARS-EV-2 infection has been named coronaus disease(COVID-19).
Till today the evidence is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. with pneumonia or without pneumonia, and most of these are cured.
In 14% cases, there are more serious cases required to be admitted to COVID-19, whereas in other 6% cases there is an observation of serious health problems.
COVID-19 due to the death rate of patients admitted to hospital is 4.4%.
In this study, we estimate the growth of COVID-19 in every country of the European Union(EEE) and United Kingdom(UK) in every country and country. We compare it to China.
We compare the present number of COVID-19 cases with Italy during May 31th March 1520.
EU/EEA countries and COVID -19
After China, the geographical expansion of COVID-19 was further extended, and currently in the world of COVID-19 epidemic increased from this country.
On 11th March 2020, Maharashtra of World Health Organization(WHO) declared COVID-19.
Compensation edition of 2020 March's 5th March edition, Spiterital. According to WHO's definition, the first European constitutional COVID-19 cases were reported.
In EU/EA, on 24th January 2020 by France, three of those who returned from China were reported.
Till 15th March 2020, cases of COVID-19 in all 30 EEA countries and United States(UK) were found, in which only 1750 cases from Italy and 1,441 deaths were indicated between 39,768 cases and 1,72 deaths.
Collection of COVID-1919 cases and accumulation of resources
European disease prevention and control center(ECDC), only official sources like the Department of Health, national and regional health authority and every country of the world from COVID-1919 is calculated every day from every country of the world by 8:00 p.m.
These statistics were used to assess the tendency of COVID-19 in EK and compare with the disease caused by Italy.
As a representative of the expansion of COVID-193 cases, we have done this during the period of 1 January 15th March 2020 every growth of COVID-19 in UK and in view of the increase in distribution of 14 days in COVID-19.
We also showed a large number of cases in each country in comparison to Italy during the period 31th January 15th March 2020.
The tendency of the EEEA countries and the COVID-19 in the UK
The tendency of COVID-1919 cases in the EU/EK is usually followed by the Hubbai province(China).
The overall distribution of COVID-19 of COVID began on February 21 and grew faster around 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to rapid increase in the number of cases referred to by Italy, but all others were seen to be the same increase in the accumulation of COVID-19(India content).
Drawings 2EEEA countries and in the UK the number of COVID-19 cases related to Italy is 31 January 15th March 2020.
Specially it shows that till 15th March, at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and UK had already given details of the total number of cases taken by Italy in 3 weeks or less than three months.
Our results indicate that the number of cases indicated by COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in EEA and UK.
COVID-19 saw a tendency to spread that epidemic is increasing in all countries with comparison.
This is in different phases of countries, in different aspects of national public health and in countries it is perhaps different protocol to select different matters, definitions and patients, which should be examined and examined and examined.
Earlier on March 2020, doctors in Italy told about the condition in which 10% of the members of COVID-19 needed deep care and media sources indicated that hospital and intensive care units have already reached their maximum capacity.
The data of COVID-193 cases to be admitted to hospital and/or deep care unit is available only 6% and▁1.% of other cases are available at EE/EEA level(not shown).
Although he should be collected in terms of current surveillance data which concentrate on the number of cases and number of deaths.
In the study of 2010-11, there was a huge difference between deep care in Europe and the availability of central care on Rs 100,000 population in Germany from 29.2 to 4.2 sleepings in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy(2010-11) per billion population care on 12.5 and central care.
High care capacity(9% risk related to bed capacity) In the hospital's distribution of COVID-19 cases, with estimates about health care of country and UK, health care factors related to the▁पूरी half of ECDC risk.
As far as matters are formed into groups in the EEE/EEK and hospitals and large care units normally provide services to the regional population, information about matters and sleep should be provided at the level.
Experiences from Italy and current trend in other countries show that COVID-1919 epidemics are rapidly increasing in EEA and UK.
countries, hospitals and intensive care should thus prepare themselves for the development of community broadcasts of SARS-V-2 and health care, particularly in the affected regions of Italy, such as COVID-19.
As indicated by recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, there is a need to slow down the spread of SARS-EV-2 ; because if time has not been spent then the number of cases expected increase is expected to be understood by doctors and hospitals, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
Fast risk assessment also lists public health measures in removing the effects of epidemic.
In order to slow down the spread of SARS-EV-2, countries have very little opportunity to reduce pressure on their control efforts and health care.
Failing to do this, it is very likely that there should be rapid increase in patients who are expected to come to health care of other EEA countries during the days or weeks of deep care.
Heavy acute respiratory syndrome(SARS syndrome) Due to 2(SARS-Counciation), Coronas(SARS-1982) have died from the fury of 2019(COID-19), and more than 80,000 people have been infected in China and the world, which resulted in suffering for humans.
Like his homologous virus SARS-EV, which caused SARS among thousands of people in 2003, SARS-EV-2 can be transmitted from batsman and produce similar symptoms by the method of action.
However, COVID-19 is less serious and death rate than the SARS, but it's extremely radical and affects men than older people and women.
In response to the number of publications growing on the emerging disease, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensive review on research subject.
We're going to include the basic things on disease epidemic science, science, medicine, treatment, predictment and prevention.
Even though we still find answers to many questions, we hope this review will help understand the fatal disease and eliminate it.
Due to the wrath of Nanvalal disease, on 25th January 2020 all Chinese people who were asked to stay in the house for weeks after their stay and after this have become unlikely and forgotten.
virus is very similar to korogenus, which caused severe respiratory syndrome in 2003. Therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was named as SARS-1992, and it was named as CoV-191919(COID-19191).
The epidemic started from China and spread rapidly throughout the country and around 50 other countries of the world.
Due to 2th March 2020, there are more than 40,000 patients from hospital and over 3,000 patients died with COVID-19.
WHO warned that COVID-19(191)'s enemy is 1and probably is more powerful than terrorism.
Pubmed -LRB- {www.c.c.m.m.m.g.giv/pummed/), according to the first report on 7th January 2020, in less than two months after the first report, viruses, diseases, diseases, sciences, etc, and treatment, more than 200 articles have been published on COV-19, so that many persons are determined by the virus.
This review tries to give a summary of research progress on the subject which is growing faster.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare the other diseases caused by COVID and CoV, Middle East Sylvson syndrome(MERS, 2012).
We're going to discuss the prevention and predictation of disease as well as some more questions that we have already learnt about.
The CVs mainly created about 15% of the normal winter process, which is considered to be non-depressive disease for humans.
In this century, though, we have faced two times the most diseased human cooperation, i.e., SARS-EV and MSSV, due to which, basically, in 2003, the anger was seen in Saudi Arabia and soon died in many other countries.
Thus, the present COVID-1919 men's history is the thirdरof anger(
As shown in diagram 11, groups of pneumonia whose origin was unknown, for the first time on December 31, 2019, Chinese National Health Commission was informed of.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoV was issued.
On 15th January 2020, the first fatal case was indicated by Vajun.
During this period, epidemic spread rapidly into neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20th January, health care providers received information about infection, which indicated that humanisation was possible from human beings.
On 23 January, with all its public transport closed on January, Vaujan was locked down.
On January 24th of January the first clinical study was indicated that only 21 of the 41 persons who believed was direct contact with sea food market which was considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared anger as global health disaster.
Till the time of this report, disease has already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries of the world(▁कार्य2).
Since the situation is rapidly increasing, the final intensity and intensity of anger remains to be determined.
On 11th February 2020 4,02, including COVID-1939 patients, there was more detailed description of the plague in the majority study of 8,866.com/budd.com/HFX(HRB-HRB-HRB-RB-).
From SARS-EV-2 everybody was infected, but mainly at 30-65 years old.
About half of infected persons(47.7%) were older than 50 years, less than 20 years and only 14 persons under 10 years were under age.
SARS-EV-2 women(27/100,000) than women(0.31/100,000) were infected more.
COVID-19 mainly in Hubi and around it in swarms.
COVID-19 for an average of 5 (2-9 days from beginning to diagnosis.
The average innovation period was 4.8(3.0.7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5(4.8-13).
Original reproduction number(R0).77(95% CI:3.51-05), and rate was R022-42.22.22.2
The number of infected people increased faster than 23 January 2020, which corresponds to extensive transport before spring in China.
The death rate of patients who are believed to be 1.44%(95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) was 3.06%(95% CI: 2.0-59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were penis(men), age(online60), and serious pneumonia.
CoVs, RNA's single co-friended viruses are sub-repaired.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e. alpha, beta, vitamins and deltas, from which alpha and beta are known as infected.
Chawla(SDP), SARSOV and MSSV in turn it connects to aluminous anthropology(AC2)(AC2)(DP4) and it connects to the XP4 and then it is added to▁सहायताnic acid.
Vairal RNA is free into organic substance; after the invention of Vairal Gnome, covers with g▁करने▁लो▁लोcokopic acids and nicide protein, thus becomes a part of genotypes which becomes free from the virus((
The first genotype of SARS-EV-2 was mentioned on 10 January 2020.
SARS-OV-2 got a new type of beta-Coun-Cooperation in which the main place of anger was found in 10 sequenced specimens from sea feed market, 99.98%.
SARS-EV-2 genotype is more similar than MSS-English.
Various parts of human air technology are found by the▁अक्षमastructure, SARS-EV-2ths are found in various parts of nature.
Human A▁किताब2, SARS-EV-2 along with SARS-EV-2 was found alive for SARS-PV.
However, SARS-OV-2's SARS(RSS-EV) is connected with greater weakness than that of SARSE2 which corresponds to the fact that SARS-V-2, the patient produces less serious infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-EV-2, or f3b, by coded short protein and(f8).
SARS-EV-2 can play role in orf3b disease, and can suppress the expression of yourshN. However, there is no known working domain or mobile.
On 18th February 20, 2020, Kalu, Tal. has given information about the formation of man's ECE2 which is full length of the entire length.
He found that the mixture, which consisted of free and closed compositions, was stored as a breather and the ACE2-BAT1 mix can add to two proteins which gives evidence to the identity and infection.
B0AT1, SARS-EV-2 infection can become a medical target for treatment investigation.
Basic and▁सबकेmiculated
It is known that SARS-EPAV and MSSV - Both batsmen were born and human beings were transmitted by parent and camel.
By comparison with SARS-OV-2 other co-officials, the batsman was considered to be the basic provision of SARS-EV2, because the new virus is called 'SRS -LRB-(SLRB-SLV)845(SLVVX) and 28-SLVOX21(194) is equal to 96%.
However, because of the environmental▁यरूशलेम which passed the virus species and helped free man from infection, it is still possible to make clear the path that leads to infection.
Ji, Tal, proposed the snake from batsman as a virus in human beings, which included the same regenerationionionion with the ST protein.
According to one study Gang, researchers in China indicated that Jamin was mostly long used in traditional Chinese medicine, ant eating animal found in SARS-V-2(1982) and sARS-9% genetic equality based on SARS-V-V-2 global2 are possible constituents.
However, there is still a big difference between the difference of% in both Gnome; hence, there is a definite outcome for solid evidence(Picture 33).
SARS-EV-2's physical qualities are not known yet.
SARS-RSV and MSSV -EV can survive from 48 hours and less than 20 degreesC and 40% per cent per day on October 5 days.
SARS-EV-2 can have equal qualities.
It has been suggested that SARS-EV2, 56 degrees C is sensitive to the blood pressure for 30 minutes ; ether, 35, chlorine, chrometic acid, chrometic acid, chlorine and other fats can effectively activate viruses, but not chlorine.
There is usually a lack of resistance towards the whole human population of SARS-EV-2 and therefore this is extremely important to nil virus.
Currently there is no detailed study regarding SARS-EV-2 defence response.
Therefore, we can only refer to the previous studies on other Cabinets, especially SARS-EV and Microsoft-V.(picture 4.4).
Normally it is first recognized by C-type▁दानin-type,▁तबal-like▁मेopteres(TLR), nD-DR(NLR), and ND-DD-D-D-DR(RR)(RR),(RR)(RRB-(RR)▁तब▁तब▁तब▁तब▁तबe-D-D-D-Detape(R)
By different ways, the expression of virus factors, the maturity of diartic cells, and types of metabolic cells, which limit the spread of virus and reduces blood pressure to normal.
However, DNA of SARS-EV can help virus against defence reactions.
Very soon, blood pressure joins in fighting viruses.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in protection of▁जलcakox.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce viruses and CD8+T cells directly kill viruses.
In order to help protect cells of T assistant cells, Prakanda player produces cicine.
However, if we kill cell cells, we can block cell functions.
Tribunal resistance is also necessary to fight veral infection like c3a and C5a.
For example, the doctors separated from the healthy patient disabled MERS-QV.
On the other hand, the greater reaction of the defence system produces a large number of particles locally which can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst conditions, multi▁अनुसार failure and death.
There are more likely to affect older people and pregnant women who are interested in starting in the flock.
It is common for people who come into contact with a large number of viruses or those whose resistance works are mixed, they are more likely to get infected than others.
On the basis of study of 425 cases first, the average in 2001-1992 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,99 cases saw that there was an average of 3 days and its limit was 0 to 24 days.
As stated above, on the basis of page 8,866 of subjects, recent studies showed that YouTube was 4.8(3.0.7.2) days.
On the basis of the exact number of ejaculation periods, it is important to adjust effective quadrant time and thus preventing viruses from transmitted to people without symptoms.
As normal practice, the virus comes in contact with or infected people usually need Quarantine of 14 days.
Should Quantinal time be extended for 24 days?
The fever is often the main and early symptoms of COVID(19), which can not be marked by any signs or other signs like dry cough, loss of breath, pain in muscles, swelling in muscles, swelling in hips, pain in throats, pain in chest, pain, pulses, pulses and gums.
Some patients, after the first week of the disease, experienced breathing pain and pain/or Hypoxemia.
In serious cases, rapid respiratory syndromes in patients increased faster than acidity and growth of technology.
Fluctuations of fever and //or respiratory symptoms and respiratory depictions should be examined for preconditionion of patients with severe fever.
Towards the end of December 2019, the population study found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing pain ; 8% of patients needed support of surgery.
The same conclusions were indicated in two recent studies produced by the family group and non-official person.
Similarly, studies of 2012 showed that there were main symptoms of fever(98%), dry cough(47%) and breathing pain(55%).
However, more than COVID-199 patients, 80% of them needed support and this corresponds to the greater fatality of COVID-19.
Dance(26%) and throat of throat(21%) was also seen in the patients of MERS.
In SARS patients, fever(99%-100%), dry cough(29%), dry breath(29%),ये 40%(40%), stroke(20-38%), strokes(13-100), and nearly 14% of patients needed support.
Till 14 February, COVID-19 was 2%, when there were more than 66,576 around the world.
Similarly, till November 2002 SARS's death rate was 8,96 per cent of cases.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% on the basis of the population study of June 2012.
Earlier studies indicated that SARS-EV-2 R071-7.23 was more than 95% of faith interval(CI), while SARS-V-V was only between 2-4.
Regarding symptoms, deaths rate and R0 related to MARS-EV-2 MERSV and SAR-PAV are compared to Table 1.1.1.
The above statistics indicate that the capacity to extend SARS-EV-2 is greater than MSSV and SARS-EV, but it is less deadly than both of them.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-EV-2 is more challenging than MSSV and SARS-EV.
There's usually one family or only one group or vehicle in the flock, such as khuj waters.
There is often a history of contact between patients during the last two weeks or other affected areas.
However, it has been suggested that people can pass virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that the patients released from hospital can repeat virus again, which warns to increase the time of Quentin.
The number of white cells in patients in early stages is normal or less.
For example, Lesika cell count(lt; 1x16/L) with white blood count(lt(lt; 4▁एक्सx16/L) along with LEF/L, Lifolio and increased Esperation levels and viruses are found in 1809 COVID.
Some patients have increased blood levels of blood sugar andइसoglorine and diabetes. Most patients have been diagnosed with diabetes and diabetes.
During serious cases, there was a product of fall in blood, the level of dieseler, and the data cells continue to decline.
Most of the COVID-19 patients get unusualities in the radioography of the chest and in the lungs diarrabilities are shown by diagnotypes or textiles
In patients there are often unusual pneumonia, severe lung damage and severe respiratory crisis syndrome(ARDS) develop.
When ARDS is there, there is a serious agreement with the gas exchange due to masturbation, fluids and progressive fertilisers.
Type-I(I) and Type of New Zealand's adverse reaction reduces the▁पत्थरluminic level and increases surface stress and thus reduces the ability of lungs to flourish and increases the risk of reducing lung activity.
Therefore, the worst conclusion of chest radioography is often parallel with the most serious condition of disease.
On 18th February 2020, the first diagnosis of the disease was seen in the lungs of someone who died of a disease, in the lungs of a patient, the formation of a neuropolitan membrane, and the darkness of the blood cells, and the multimediatic chromosome cells, which was similar to the patient's disease, which was the disease of the patient and the diabetics.
By Rivers(RT-PCR), SeARS-2 RNA was used as the major criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to higher wrong rate, which can speed up the epidemic, 13th February 2020 began to be used for diagnosis of clinical expressions in China(which no longer depended on RT-PCR).
The same situation happened with SARS's diagnosis.
Therefore, the history of disease, clinical expressions, lab tests and radioular conclusions are necessary and necessary to make effective diagnosis.
On 14th February 2020, Feang Diag group has created a protocol using the CARS-EV-based SHROC technology, which has been used by means of disparagement, which is 20/18/200m needed without any extensive equipment.200-18-18m(intube perputer per cell) at 10-10-102 copies.
If Nadranik specimens are verified, then there is hope that new technology can grow dramatically and dramatically.
Due to lack of experience with Novell CoV, other doctors like SARS-E▁भविष्यवाणीVV and MSSV and other neurons have been used earlier for treatment or proposed medical treatment with modern technology can provide special help to different patients(KVID-192).
These medicines include anti▁मददal drugs, defencers, solvents, medicines with proper patients, sugar medicine and psychological support, present and possible treatment.
Photo is also proposed to cure patients.
There is competition between drug companies to develop vaccines and vaccines towards viruses.
SARS-EV-2 originates mainly on lungs and probably on other organs, which express ASC2, such as Xerxic system and kidney.
However, Sivason is a major threat to those who are vulnerable and there are major causes of death.
Therefore, it's important to save from symptoms and save life and it includes normal oxygen, high oxygen oxygen, non-intension,▁राजtituation and infrastructure.
Accombination(ECMO(ECMO) in one of those symptoms of serious respiratory symptoms has to help with changes in heart-organary subsidiary mode technology used in treating fatal heart failure(ECMO), life fatal heart disease or respiratory failure.
At the same time, it is necessary to maintain ozone balance, prevention of secondary infection, treatment and treatment, insulin and important organs to protect SARS-PV-2 patients.
It is known that Sanskrit Stum SARS and MERS are the main reaction of the defence system.
Sabidant Stum TNF Exchange, IL-1 wide, IL-2, IL-1, IL-6, I▁अकारN, Sshnhan, SivaN, SIFN, and MCP-1 is the kind of non-cooperation of site conversion.
These are a large number of free particles in order to free the defence cells, which are the main cause of failure.
Defense is necessary in the treatment of the Consolidated Stumm, especially in serious patients.
Corriticosoperation and Tocensumumb, IL6-Officol Perarti, Sayotic Stummy Stummm. have been used for treatment.
In other defence treatment for siteintenskrit Stummers, there are changes in the treatment of THN-IL-1, and TNF's nose noses; YK blocking block(Englishing),ulating speed of 4 runs ; and HDAC blockators are included.
SARS 's treatment was widely used to reduce the severity of damage as defencer.
However, in SARS and COVID-199 patients high doses of lung damage were not useful.
Instead of this, they can cause serious damage by dramatically affecting disease, especially non-cooperation boneide.
However, at lower-level doses, there has been serious research on use in COVID-199 patients.
Till the time of writing, no effective antivisal experience has been confirmed.
However, a nuclementary analog has been found effective in one American patient of COVID-19.
In the beginning, in the treatment of diseases caused by Ibama and Malburg virus, there is no alternative treatment for the treatment of diseases developed by the National Institute.
Afterwards, Reedivor also showed possible constraints of RNA virus including MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of this, it has made China available compounds for two experiments on people infected with SARS-EV-2-2 and results are expected.
At the same time, Barinib, Interferon-fone, Ayopier/ritorier, and Ribivin is suggested as possible medical for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Ayopi▁भवनer/ritocre with joint medical treatment can occur after infection, cough, tooth loss and other adverse reactions.
These treatments should be carefully checked with other drugs used in patients.
Use and machinery from patients who are able to do right.
There has been a long history of raising blood from infected patients for treating other patients or preventing healthy people from suffering from disease.
In fact, there are relatively high levels of patients with diabetic blood.
In order to fight disease and other external substances, the DNA cells produced by BLC are meg and they identify the unique molecules in disease, which are directly disabled.
On the basis of this, solvents were collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and were diagnosed in 10 serious cases.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours with low blood weight and high oxygen density.
However, unless special medical techniques are developed, authentication and clarification are essential for proposed use on large scale.
At the same time, despite medical influences, some of the damages relating to plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, anti-economic defence reaction can be highly▁अन्त and can cause oral replacement syndrome, which is likely to lead fatal poison to life.
Blood users are generally lower in blood, and there is greater demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients.
It's difficult to develop and produce specific individuals so fast to fight global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and more important to identify the genetic code which is used to distinguish the correct patients and to identify the effective genetic code or to examine the essential proteins of viruses.
Thus, we can quickly increase the production of consumers.
For thousands of years, various diseases have been used in China for treating various diseases.
However, its effect depends mainly on the combination of different components based on pTCM principles.
Most effective component is still unknown or incomplete because it is difficult to remove and verify these components or their▁इससे combinations.
Right now, due to the strength and lack of special medical care for COVID,PM has become one of the major alternative alternative treatments for patients who have recovered from serious stages.
For example, Sugar Feang, Dance, Dance, Dance Vindus, Vivekannas are effective for treating COVID-19.
Gangas(63.7%), Nakinsiya(50%), and Hunan(50%), along with YouTube(50%), there were 87% patients in many regions of China which were found to be more correct in treating COVID-19, whereas Hubi, where only 30% of the COVID persons were used in COM, the minimum was 25%(13%).
However, it's quite thick compared because there are many other effects factors, such as the number and depth of patients should be included in evaluation.
on 18th February 2020, Kalang and fellow workers published studies to compare the treatment of Western medicine and WM and STM with joint treatment.
He found that the temperature of body temperature in WM+TCM group was significantly lower than that of the WM group.
The most influential, only the WM group compared to WMCM group was markedly lower(7.4% vM2%) and death rate was less than WM+TCM group(8.8% vM%(39%).
However, for the success and safety of CTCM there are still larger levels and higher centres waiting for further investigations.
It will also be interesting to mark the system of action and make clear the effective components of the CTCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
COVID-19's suspect or confirmed patients experience a lot of fear from infectious diseases and fatal diseases. People of Querence also experience frustration, loneliness and anger.
Also, the symptoms of infection like fever, fluctuations and swelling effects such as fluctuations caused by coronary diagnospheries and psychological pain.
In the early phase of SARS anger, constant tension, nervousness, nervousness, mental symptoms, psychological disorders, even suicide, many psychological diseases are reported.
COVID-19C's public health response as part of public health response, and Quartonine; people can become more restless about the effects of stains and damages on their families and their families.
Therefore, patients of COVID-19 along with those who are suspicious and those who come in contact with them should provide mental care to the masses.
In psychological support there should be use of professional electronic devices and applications for avoiding close contact with each other.
Helpful vaccines are required to disrupt contact with animals and infected humans with sensitive nutrients and often due to increasing viruses control of epidemic treatment.
SERS-ECC has been tried to develop protein-based tackleries to produce long-term and powerful devoidance against it.
Jamna-transidad Tak has been appreciated in SARS' life, but in sculptures.
However, before the advent of any neurological study of these candidates, both young people and deadly challenges, they are still supposed to be set up.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new case has been indicated since then.
On the other hand, due to the presence of data sources in the affected areas, there are multiple cases and groups born in the Middle East and spread in other regions.
disabled viruses,▁प्रदानzephideal vectors, neuroscents, viruses, organic particles and repercussions of protein are developed and some of the animals have been appreciated in specimens.
For people with non-official capacity, it is essential and important to develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-52 which is going to control the epidemic.
However, there is a challenge in the development of vaccines because of long time -LRB- e.g. 18 months -RRB- and because of dynamic differences of covs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 recently has begun to express its entire clinical mechanism in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MSS, COVID-19 also deals with high blood pressure and death rate in cases of serious cases.
Therefore, it is important for health-based agencies to lay down the health priority of their services directly, especially those with limited resources.
The following factors can affect or relate to the disease of the COVID-19 patients -LRB- hospital 33:
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS illness, which is also true for COVID-19.
8,866 studies took place at COVID-19 mainly at 30-65 years of age, from which 477% were older than 50 years of age, as described above.
There was a greater possibility of co-operation and complexity in patients concerned with deep care and that they were more important than those who did not need such. They were higher age than those(6.6% age), which indicated the age of predicting the outcome of COVID-199 patients.
gender: More men than women than SARS-PV-2 are infected.31/100,000 v.027/100,000, as mentioned above.
Accombination and complexity: COVID-1960 patients who need deep care are more likely to suffer from severe heart damage and damage.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been suggested that SARS-PV2, ACE2-Counciative transferment can be connected with companies which can cause hepatitis disease in COVID-199 patients.
It is worth considering that there is deep relationships between aging and heredity and that they can interfere with each other.
unusual lab conclusion(CRP)(CRP(CRP) level shows the seriousness or loss of tissue and it is proposed as a possible predictor of disease, reaction to medicine and finally recovery.
COVID-19's seriousness and ill-dependence of CRP level have also been proposed.
At the same time LDOS(LDH), Esperte Antoriots(AST), Ellenin▁आवाज़identians(ATT) and Creation Kinnings(CK) can also help to predict the result.
These chromosomes are widely exposed in other parts, especially in the heart, and in the liver damage.
Thus, they are the traditional indicators of heart disease.
Main clinical symptoms: With other problems, current progress of COVID-19 has to be considered to predict the consequences and complexity.
Presiding: As stated above, for reducing the seriousness of heart attack usually in infectious diseases as anti-economic treatment.
Because of the high concentration of corriticosphosis, high doses were widely used in serious SARS patients, many living people were suffering from disability and poor life quality of their lives.
So, if it is necessary, it should be used in COVID-19 for lower doses and short duration.
Mental Stress: As stated above, many patients have suffered from unusual stress during the anger of COVID-19, because they often suffered from long periods and extreme uncertainty and became witnesses of the death of family members and partner.
It is necessary to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people get out of stress and come back to normal life.
So far, according to social studies of COVID-19 different epidemic features are shown.
In addition to converting into lower respiratory path, SARS-EV-2, there can be a replica into upper sanskrit path and other modes produced in the early stages of infection, like other co-operation, does not produce any symptoms.
Therefore, there can be a large amount of virus during the early phase or during daily activities with the control of infected patient epidemic.
However, SARS-EQV was converted when patients were very sick, whereas most of them were not during early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is very serious and difficult to control against the anger of SARS.
SARS-EV-2, hoping to disruptation in the tracking of VUHON and the lockdown in nearby cities and nearly all the people's constant Quarin are doing great efforts in China.
Although these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other regions of the country, the number of new patients is declining, which points to the fall of epidemic.
Most optimistic estimates is that anger will end till the end of March and steps down will last 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so promising.
Paul▁लें, T.K., estimated that COVID-19 which appears more infectious than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Bira Longini, Tal, established a model for predicting the result of epidemic and suggested that SARS-EV-2000 population of the world can be infected.
The group of Canadians reported that SARS-EV-2 and 2 weeks ago from hospital was identified in both Midd-tobini and sabha, which indicates that the new virus identified can be repeated again and again like Influja.
However, on the basis of the minimum number of new cases there are expected indications from China which indicate that present strategys are working.
Initially it was predicted that there would be a million cases along with half the deaths of Ibama.
However, by hard Quentin and partition, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that like SARS-EPA, SARS -RRB- becomes weak inV-2 infectiousity and eventually ends or co-operative with humans becomes less contagious virus.
COVID-1919 epidemic's SARS and MSS are compared below(Picture 55)
SARS-EV-2 Dance or sniffing and perhaps direct contact with viruses is also very remote from direct contact.
virus is also found in bugs, which also generates a new possibility of fertilising.
138 The recent study of other cases indicated that 41% cases were probably caused by clinical infections including 17 patients and 40 health providers.
Therefore, human beings, particularly health providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients should also be very careful to protect those who are infected.
The first line of defence, which can be used to reduce the risk of infection, is to wear the mask; it helps control the spread of viruses using insulin masks and N95 Sivas(Criz # 1860s).
Photokimicic facial masks prevent fluctuations from possibly infected person to go into air or cling to the surface of things from where they can go to others.
However, with only 5% v▁रसूलan, there is only N95(Critis # 1860) masks only 10 to 80 nm which can prevent small vortics from entering into the breath; SARS-OV-2 is similar to SARS-2 size and approximately 85m.
Since particles can also cross five surgery masks placed above each other, health care provider with patients needs to wear N95 # 1860s masks, but not insulin treatments.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear ice pollution lines that fit contact with viruses.
virus can infect someone with eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician was infected by SARS-EV-2, although he wore N95 masks ; maybe the virus has entered into the body with his eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shield or glasses while working with patients.
In affected or possibly affected areas people are advised to wash their hands often more often than usual, try to stay within the house and contact infected persons with infected persons.
Three feet are considered to stay away from the patient.
These activities include reducing the risk of infection as well as effective measures to prevent the spread of viruses.
Even though SARS-PV-2 came to the world as a new virus, as indicated on 7th January 2020, due to excessive equality from SARS-EV, it must have warned China on the basis of deep memory of SARS anger.
However, by 19th January 2020, the director of Vujan 's disease control control director gave his advice to citizens that Noval virus has less infection and limited capacity of human beings and there is no problem in preventing disease.
This message freed the people from fear, especially when the country was preparing for spring celebration and the time left for reducing disease to the lowest level.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make important improvements in future.
For example, these agencies should be quite careful when making public declarations because each word has meaning for citizens and can change their outlook and decisions ; (2) instead of waiting for formal information from doctors or authorities, they should be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information ; (3) instead of trying to comfort the masses, there should be more restrictions on preventing epidemics in the early stages ; and (4) for the public to increase awareness of epidemics and to enable society to respond effectively.
Noval virus produced by SARS-EV-2 was started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and around 50 other countries of the world till the time of this writing.
Since viruses are equal to COVID-19 and SARS have similar symptoms, the anger of COVID-19 has made it possible for SARS to be frequent.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS which are necessary to limit the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19% affects men more than old men and women, and the severity and death rate among older people is higher than youth.
SARS Death rate is more than COVID-19(10.91% v.44%)
COVID-19th patient broadcast the virus even though SARS often do it when they are seriously ill, which makes it very difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-EV-2, SARS-PV is more rapid and wide than it is.
SARS-EV-2 regular RNA test can be played in some COVID-1960 patients.
On the other hand, there can be another disease for viruses.
These conclusions increase the risk of the spread of viruses dramatically.
In spite of such rapid progress on COVID-19, there are many serious cases which are below:
Where did SARS-EV-2 come from?
Although SARS-OV-2 and two batsmen SARS - As per CoVs, 96% genetic equality was found, we still cannot arrive at the conclusion that SARS-EV-2 bats.
What animal was the middle species in the world's broadcasting of viruses from the original nutrients, if any, batsman?
#1 and 2. Without answering, we can't effectively stop broadcasting and we can get rid of anger.
Although the molecular genotype and biological tests have been seen in the SARS-EV2 connects to AC2, how does the virus enter the air path cells and then changes the disease?
Does the virus also bind the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can't achieve fast and exact diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is virus becoming genetically developed during transfer to human beings?
Will it become a global epidemic, like SARS, gradually ends up, or like flu will occur again and again?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever price we have to pay, we have no choice except to prevent the epidemic quickly and bring our lives into normal state.
Human coorona viruses are developed
Due to mutations and adaptation there has been development in thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human codes which produce small diseases like promulgate were known.
The furys of serious acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) and mid-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused the situation to be completely reversed while displaying the devastating and fatal nature of HDP infection.
Towards the end of 2019, the origin of SARS-EV-2 in central China has again brought Corvs into light and its sister SARS-UVS-PHRB- has surprised us with more contagious capacity than that of the disease.
HPV infection is an animal disease and it will be useful for us to understand the animal species.
Most of them were born from Huavis batsman, in which they are non-official.
There are also information about some HRPS central▁शक्.
In prevention of human diseases, animals are directly exposed to the identity of nutrients.
Analysising co-friend action in animals can also give important insight into the disease of CoV in humans.
In this review, we look at the present information about seven HRPVs while considering the history of the search.
Importantly, we compare different HDPs and differences from the perspective of viruses.
Present coVID(COVID-191) is discussed in this perspective of epidemic.
At the same time, the need to change successful nutrients and the severity of disease has been shed on the effects of the gradual development of viruses.
Corona virus is from Cornavid family, including Inveld,▁निकटided, Single-Stunded RNA virus.
In RNA virus, these viruses which provide shelter to the largest of 26 to 32 kilometres, are named as crown-shaped.
Procedureally, there are no segments of text, whose structure is equal.
About two-thirds Gnome consists of two big mass reading frames(ORF1 and ORF1ब), which are converted into pp1 and pp1 blichers Pollution.
Legislative acid is processed to produce 16 non-official protein called polyproportional.
In the rest of Gnome(S), Invellap(E), Membran(M)(N)(N) are designed for organic protein.
Many chromosomes are coded by different genotypes of CVs.
On the basis of difference in protein sequences, the CoV is divided into four generations(Eph-English, beta), beta(English),▁आतीta(English(EnglishV) and delta(Cooperation), most of them are Haj(A, B, C), and its four chromosomes(A(A, C) are divided into subdivers.
Among casteic evidence there is seen that batsman and bugs are mostly the gene source of alpha(English) and betas, whereas birds are prominent in digestives and deltas
For thousands of years, coves have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some of them have emerged as important human diseases.
Till today, seven human codes are known.
Out of them there are HoV-229E and H.V.N.63 Alpha-EV.
Other five Tata-Counctions include H.V.C.3,H.V.U.O.U.A.(SRSSDS-Councision)
HRV-229E,HUPV-OC3, HUPV-1 and HUPV-NAV63 generally produce light features like jute and/orphal.
On the other hand, SARS-PRSV, MSSV and newer identified as SARV-2, strong respiratory distress syndrome(AIRS) and more likely than that of high blood pressure in patients are highly affected.
The first HPV-229 generation, B814, was separated from the flow of the nose of the patients who were in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, there has been added more information about H▁अधिकारV-229E and HDP3 through detailed study, both of which produce symptoms which are limited to themselves.
In fact, till the anger of SARS this concept was widely accepted that HRPV's infection is usually harmless.
About 10% of deaths due to deaths due to deaths due to over 8,०००000 people died in 2003, the anger of SARS was one of the most devastating calamities in present history.
Ten years later, anger caused epidemics which continued to occur in Arabian peninsula along with other sources spread over the Middle East.
2019 No.N.V.(2019-N.V.), which later named SARS-CoV-2(COV-191)(COVID-19), due to which 3120 people have died, and more than 91 million people have been infected.
The warning bell is ringing and the world has to be prepared for the coming epidemic of SARS-EV-2.
All seven Hydrogens are derived from batsman, rat or domestic animals.
Many evidence supports progressive development from all HyVs batsmans, including viruses are well-organised and non-organized, but there are enormous genetic differences.
COVID-19th epidemic has presented huge medical problems for China, scientific, social and moral.
It provides a framework for understanding the natural history, dynamic power and structure factors of the HoVs.
This can guide or make it accessible with an important effect on preventing future spread by SARS-EV-2, central and growing animals.
In this review we take a look at the root, interconnected differences and disease.
In particular, we put light on the common subject and discuss that the viruses of HypVs are non-organised in their natural processes, but after the interconnection of the new nutrients become contagious.
We're going to review the growth of the HRPV, in which the growth of infectious disease is often due to reduction in disease.
In this perspective SARS-EV-2's wrath is also discussed.
Sea is known from the end of the 1930s.
For the first time separated from the nasika flow of infected people, many of them were separated from other infected animals including HypV-229 species.
Seven HRPs are identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the rotation of HRPV's discovery will be based on information and education.
The first generation of HoV-229E in 1966 was separated from the upper sanskrit path of patients who were diagnosed with high blood pressure, which later became traditional for the growth of WI-38 lungs.
HRV-229E caused 1020% cases with fever and cough, cough, cough and throat symptoms.
Later in 1967, H▁अधिकारV-OC3 was separated from the gradual path in the brain of the mouse and the organ is distributed.
HEV-OC3 infection is similar to infection caused by H▁अधिकारV-229E which is symbolicly included in Influenza A virus and▁हालiophies along with other pathogens.
HRV-229E and HPOC3 are spread all over the world and with cold weather it is likely to be transmitted mainly during winter season.
Generally, the growth of these two viruses is less than one week after which there is about 2-month disease.
According to a study of human volunteers, mild treatment developed among healthy persons infected by HDP-229E.
In some patients, unable to defend, there can be serious lower respiratory infection.
SARS which is also known as Anthropical pneumonia was the first well-known plague in human history due to HRPV and because of this, the base is the third HRPV, SARSS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be marked at the end of 2002 in Guangdo Pradesh.
With the spread of the epidemic of SARS in many countries and continents, 8096 cases were recorded.
Apart from most spreaders, it has been estimated that the gradual growth duration of 4 to 7 days and maximum number of days of disease can be shown on account of about two secondary cases.
In the early stages of muscle pain, heart pain, swelling and coldness, after which pain, cough and respiratory crisis are shown as symptoms of later symptoms.
Liupopia, Viditivised work test and increasing design programmes related to the lab of SARS are commonities.
The spread of air pollution, the spread of industrial cell and the increase in▁करीबrophies are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% patients need intensive care and mechanicalisation later.
Apart from the lower respiratory path, several organs including the physitic path and the liver can also be infected in these serious cases which can be fatal to infected patients especially in defence.
The virus was first separated from the patient from the open biosphere of lungs which travelled from Gangang to Hong Kong.
Since then, there has been a lot of efforts in the research.
HRV-NL63 was separated from the baby of 7 months at the end of 2004 in Netherlands.
In its beginning small children, old children and disabled patients were found to be spread among victims.
HRV-NL63's disease caused by fluctury, fluctuations, fever, and bronchitis is common.
In other independent studies, about eight months of child mortality in the Netherlands was described as separation from that virus.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread across the world.
It is estimated that because of H▁अधिकारV-NAL63 there are approximately 4.7% common respiratory diseases and its climax is early summer, spring and cold weather.
HESV-NL63 blockion is related to the vowel, which is also known as kupupup.
In the same year, H▁अधिकारV- HHU1 was separated from 71 old man who was admitted to hospital with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from pneumonia and bronchitis from the community, it has also been told that it is important to belong to heart disease.
HRV-NL63,HPV-229E and HUPV-OC3 like, H.V.V.UV-HU1 light respiratory diseases were found all over the world.
All these four communities have become well-organized in humans and they are generally less likely to emerge for severe diseases, although they have accidents due to unknown causes, as in rare types of diseases caused by HRPV-N▁बार63, due to which in recent years there has been some information about serious respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when these are able to communicate effectively and maintain themselves in humans, they become less toxic or contagious.
The first time in 2012, in Saudi Arabia, was separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
where most of the cases related to the lab are derived from the Middle East, sometimes there have been reports of imported cases in many European countries and Tunisia.
Second second wrath took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 substantial cases.
Progrincive serious pneumonia special expressions of MERS correspond with SARS.
Unlike SARS, there are many patients who have been diagnosed with severe kidney failure, which has been seen only in MERS till now.
In more than 30% patients, there are symptoms such as fluctuations.
Till February 14,204% with high mortality rate of 34.4%, more than 25500 existing cases which make USS-Enavi one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From the middle of December 2019 to the end of the whole of SARS-EV-2 infection groups are found in China.
The World Health Organization has declared the state of international health emergency due to sARS-EV-2, due to air pollution movement, international concern, and the name of disease is also given to COVID-19.
By March 3,2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed across the world with the death rate of 3.4% cases.
Significantly, the death rate of cases in Hubei China is 4.2%, whereas outside this it is 1.5%.
SARS-SV-2 fertilising, cough and respiratory suffering produces serious respiratory infections like SARSV and MSS-PAV.
In some patients there are also those which are also seen.
Disease is one of the most serious symptoms and rapid respiratory crisis can increase in the form of syndrome.
However, according to 82% high news sequence equality, SARS-EV and SARS-CoV-2 are very equal, they come into different branches of caste species.
SARS-EV-2 clearly SARS-Enavi and MSS-Counciated than, but there is a greater disc.
SARS-EV-2 symptoms are reported without disease and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
SARS-EV-2 compares to six other HRPVs and contrasts have shown fascinating similarities and differences.
First, there is a very similar duration of HDP disease period and processal duration.
In this respect, SARS-EV2 follows the general tendency of six other HRPVs.
Secondly, the seriousness of the symptoms of COVID-19 is derived from SARS-EVV and four groups(or H▁हमनेV-229E, H▁अधिकारV-OC3, H▁अधिकारV-upU1 and HRPV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection of SARS-EV-2 shows a feature which is generally seen in the case of HDP infection from the community with non-normal, light or without any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of serious cases of COVID-19 are also seen, as in the case of SARS-EV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-EV-2 received from the community from the community from the community. Both types are seen.
On the one hand, the contagiousity of SARS-EV-2 is at least as high as that of HDP.
On the other hand, it's to be able to be able to be able to prove if there's geneticity of SARS-EV2,SARSV and MERS-EVS-SV, as it happens to go forward in humans.
Finally, like other HDPs, like SARS-EV-2 specimens can be traced.
Whether SARS-EV-2's software model plays an important role in at least some situations like SARS-EV, the future studies have to be explained.
It's also interesting to see if you can get from SARS-EV-2 groups like HRPVS cases.
However, after going into man, the characteristics of SARS-PV-2) will be effective on the final result of the outbreak of COVID-19.
From all four groups which produce light traits, HRPVs, humans have become well-defined.
From the other point of view, it can also be that humans have become thoroughly familiar with these four HDPs.
In other words, both old HDP can survive from epidemics.
that cause serious diseases among humans and men who develop serious HRPV diseases have been abolished.
For this reason, the supply of chemical mutation which stops the nutrients factor has to be reproduced to humans in sufficient limits.
In this sense, as late as SARS-V-2, and as many as infected people are more likely to become completely different from humans.
If this happens well, it would be difficult for humans to prevent its fluorphine or other infection measures.
For many years, from four community to millions of disabled people, human population has been spreading.
These viruses don't need animal cells.
On the other hand, highly diseased SARS-EV and MERS-EV are not well-defined among humans, and they cannot be maintained in humans.
He needs to live and expand in his animal structure and perhaps the chance to be spread by one or more constituent and sustainable human targets.
SARS-EV-2 features both SARS-EV/VERSV and from four communities are equal.
In less than the present time this community is very contagious like HRPVs.
However, it's more contagious than the HRPVs and STARS -RRV or MERS -LRB- SEV -RRB- disease.
It remains to be seen whether it will become fully accepted in humans and will spread to human beings without any penis or infrastructure.
It will be useful for us to talk about the definition and features of the evolution of Hypvs, natural, kush, co-ordination and development of nutrients.
There is a gradual development of HOV, if he gives shelter to very close ancestors along the level of nucleide sequence.

In both cases, Poush becomes physically infected, and HRPV or its pest््््््व्््त््््त्््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््व्््््व््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््रररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररर
On the other hand, if HPOV enters within or around it into a new constitutional facility, it is not well-defined in new nutrients and is often affected.
It can function as a well-organized source of human infection and enable viruses to reproduce temporarily and then it can play a role which spreads into human beings to increase the level of infection
If any HPV can not keep its position within the interconnection then it can go into an end.
On the other hand, HRPS can also be adaptable to relevant nutrients and can maintain locality for longer periods.
In this condition, environmental nutrients becomes natural nutrients.
In data on epidemic science, there was a history of contact with animals playing with SARS's point of view.
The post-General Test pointed out that there was more spread of SARS-EVG in the traders than in the common people.
In the living animals, Nandi Punjacate(Phum Motivata) and Rughon dog was identified as SARS-QV-like viruses which are very similar to SARS-ROV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that after all the markets were killed no SARS was reported.
However, it has been suggested that the living animal doesn't come into contact with the markets, most of the wild or fields found in the leaflet was SARS-Covet, which makes it difficult only to grow between them.
Significantly, since there are 80% species of sARS-EV-Exterary users in the markets of Ganga, these possibilities cannot be questioned that many species of small mammals can be added to the emission of organic nutrients.
These all appear to be the last provision of SARS-QV.
According to SARS-EV's natural animal nutrients, SARS-RS-ROlosophus Batel(SARS-RRB-RU) has revealed a very close batsman named CoV-BHU3, which is found in Chinese Hoshubas bats.
These batsmen are positive to the genotype of SARS-EVOOV,SRB-RB-RB-B-BOTU3.
These and other batsmans, with SARS-EV(92%) share equality.
These studies have laid down the basis of a new concept that batsman rises up and rises into human disease.
Cells like many SARS are also identified in batsmen but none other than WV1 has been separated into living viruses.
Human organisation converter Ajayum 2(ACE2) is known as SARS-EV.
The WVV1 specimens of batsman were exhibited for use as batsman for man ACE2 entry.
Interestingly, SARS healthy patients were able to disable WVV1.
Till now, WVIN1 95% is the oldest ancestor of SARS-PAV in the batsmen, sharing the news sequence equality.
In spite of more equality between these two viruses, it is generally believed that there is no nearest christic virus of WIVS-UV and the batter is not close to SARS-UV.
National analysis is grouped according to MERS-EV-HHU4 and Baton CoV-HungU5.
Batting CoV-HU4 and MERS-EVV virus are used for entry by the same sustainable,▁विजयdhyapidads 4(PDP4).
MERS-Counctuated RNA Pololicle sequence is situated in Europe and Africa. The batsman is close to Tata-Coopers.
Till now, none alive in wild batsmen can be found.
MERS-EV and its nearest batsman,CHV-H▁सत्यU25, only 87% are equal.
Therefore, Bats can't be close to MERS-Counctuation.
On the other hand, in the Middle East studies have seen that in many African countries, camels like camels of the Middle East, like camels of the Middle East, are from MSS-English non-officials.
Like the virus found in humans, there are different types of animals that live in the form of MERS-EV, kamp, which shows that the camel is an authentic provision of MERS-EV.
It is also noteworthy that in camels infected with MSS-English, usually with mild symptoms, but very much more viruses are seen.
Significantly, infected camels not only through sivason but also through the washing route, which is also the main way of removal of viruses from batsmen.
However, questions are still present, because there is no history of contact with camels before the advent of several of the symptoms of Microsoft cases. This is probably due to man's inability or unknown direction, which includes species of animals that provide shelter to MERS-UPV.
Different from batsmen connected with R.C.C.C.J.C.J.C.C.C.C.C.J.C.C.C.C.C.C.J.C.C.C.C.C.C.D.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.(C.C.C.C.C.C.A.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.A.
Like SARS-RSV and MSS-EV cases, the sequence between SARS-EV2 and RDP13 is enough to set up a separate relationship.
That's, batsman cannot be close to SARS-EV-2, until near batsman is found in the future.
Perhaps, according to SARS-EV-2, there should be a number of early cases of humanisation between animals sold and killed in sea feed market.
On the basis of mausoleumic sequence many recent studies suggest that there is a group of small breast cells known as sARS-V-2, i.e. sanskrit-worlds can also provide shelter.
These new Jain CoVecom with SARS-EV-2% of the numeral sequence share.
However, they are closely connected with RDP13 at the level of nucleide sequence.
He is in the casteic dynasty in two subsidiary viruses, one of which is 97.4% is associated with SARS-V-2(RBD).
On the contrary, in spite of the genetic diversity, SARS-EV2 and RDP13 are very diverse.
In the study before sick Jain, there were reports to be found from the specimens of lungs, which were related to SARS-V-2.
In this study there were several interconnected laws and manual constitutions to produce a partial genotype of 86.3% of full length.
We can't deny that Mohammedlin SARS-EV-2 is one of the central animals.
However, there is no evidence in support of SARS-PV-2 and▁निकटlinary SARSSSS-EARVAS-EVOVOVS-Councial diversity because of the diversity between Beta-Cooperation of SARS-1992, there is no evidence present.
At the same time, the distance between SARS-PV2 and RDP13 is less than SARS-EV-2SARSS-EVOVS related to beta-Cooperation.
In batsmen, panlins and other breasts, there is still to be established the way of gradual development of SARS-EV-2.
where, among SARS-OV-2 and▁जानकारीlins, the maximum sequence of RBDs has been found, SARS-EVOVES, SARS-V-V2 and ROG13 is the most vivid sequence of genotype.
It's a very absurd idea that▁संपत्तिin's SARS S-EVYOVS -RRB- and the vast equality between the RBS -RRB- and the RSS -RRB- and the RSS -RRB- is due to progressive development.
An alternative proposal is in favour of reorganisation between Jamin SARS-EVDDOV-VOV and RDP13.
As the dynamic force of evolution, regeneration is widely present in Beta-EVs.
SARS-EV-2 is not yet known.
Apart from highly diseased HyV-229, there is also a study of the genotype of haV-OC3, H▁पहुंचV-NAV63 and HUPVवववववव1.
Historical evidence indicated that there are two batsmen which can be born from H▁अधिकारV-229 CV, whereas HDP-OC3 and HPV-HV-AU1 can be found in the fluctuent virus.
It has been reported that there was close connection between the batting of H▁अधिकार(Appleleleleleleog)(VVV) which was found in three colored batsman batsman of northern American batsman.
On the other hand, H▁अधिकारV-229E Hipporos/Ghanhanam/19/2008 name was related to heredity which was found in Ghana, although its suspectals are complex.
For clarity, there is a summary of current information on the animals known as HypVs. 1 and table 2.
National Analysisation has given evidence of the interverse events of HRPVs in history.
When HESV-OC3 crossed the species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, Savison's epidemic was seen.
The history of the interconnection of the HoV-229 is less clear.
About haV-229's total batsmen have been found.
He has a minority alpha-Cooperation between him.
There are many evidence to support the movement directly from the batting of the virus to human beings.
Firstly, human beings have been contacted by batsmen in the ecological habitat.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with a minority.
Secondly, HoV-229-related batsmen in alpha-Cooperation batsmen are diverse and non-official, whereas due to short alpha-vi, scisive disease in infected animals.
After all, there's not been found among wild beasts
Therefore, there can't be any contradiction of the possibility that the minority gets from human beings.
In fact, Batb▁देखते virus, Iba virus, nephida virus and hepatitis virus are direct sources of human infected viruses.
That's why the batsmen can direct them directly to humans.
Alternatively, where batsmen alpha-EV-229's gene pools are, there may be minor camels and bugs which transmit viruses into humans, just like MSS-UPV cases.
MERS-EV batsman is an excellent example of interconnection between animals with camels and camels.
The gradual development of MERS-EV from the batsman is known as its primary identity and its later conclusions have been strengthened.
It is clear that batsmen provide a rich generation of virus species for mutual exchange of genetic organs and mutual communication.
Long life, heavy buses, nearly social activities and flying capacity are good conditions for all batsman's ideal broadcasters.
On the other hand, MERS-EV has entered camels with camels for decades.
This has become well-defined in these camels, which has been converted into stable and natural nutrients.
MERS-EV produces a very light disease and maintains relatively less mutation rate in these animals.
It has an accident in human beings, and man is made to be the final asset of MSS-English because it cannot be kept track.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-Counctuation, according to SARS-EV-2's role, if anyone is, he is different.
Specially, Panchin Beta-Enavsini is very contagious.
They can be the final asset of SARS-Counct, like SARS-EVAS-Counctuated Beta-Councts.
In human beings there are many possibilities of interdependence between animals and animals to be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, batsman's SARS-EV-2 equivalent to SARS-EVVS-Councial virus can be provided.
Human, killing or coal mining can share environmentally with batsmen.
Secondly, there can be one of the basic nutrients which contributes, in which SARS-EVRB- new virus has been entered.
human kills and games are infected with viruses through drugs.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals can be interested in SARS-EV-2.
There are surveys in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-EV-2 may be re-constituted and modified in third species, which is connected with batting and batting.
SARS-EV-2 animals are still being discovered.
Apart from various kinds of animals, three main factors in relation to Vairal are important to cross species of co-operation with ease.
First of all, his relative mutation rate in RNA review.
In comparison with RNA viruses with other single-sided RNA, according to depending on the development of CV in new organisations -LRB-10-4 Amendment per year -RRB- at an average rate of RNA -RRB- can be counted as higher than the average mutation rate of CoV.
Coves have priving Xororab▁लोlex, which can be reduced to extremely alteredness and shortness or loss of life capacity.
Interestingly, Nac▁पांचopteride, Agonalog Reeder, This Exoraboloor, and RNA-based RNA polymide, is supposed to suppress the conversion of CV.
One of the most promising SARS-Counctuated agents to be examined in Reediver▁रह in test test tests.
However, mutation rate is 10 lakh times higher than their nutrients.
At the same time, mutation rate is often greater when the coves are not quite well-defined towards nutrients.
With high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-EV-2 is obviously lower than that of humans, which points towards higher levels of adaptation.
Maybe, it's already accepted by humans about other nutrients.
With SARS-EV-2, this applies also to Microsoft-English which has become thoroughly familiar with camels with kruph.
Scientificly, there is no possibility that heredity flow against SARS-EV-2 will activate tackers and antivieral quickly.
Secondly, in CoV, bigger RNA genotype mutations and resonance changes on genotype change, which increases the possibility of inter-organic development, which is beneficial to rise when conditions are proper.
This vast open reading is supported by coded protein works at 3 wide end of Gnome.
Thirdly, the CVs is changed repeatedly during the transfer of RNA through the programme.
In the nutrients used as mixtures, chromosome changes usually occur during the process of text transferion.
with absolute equal length and subsidiary RNA, reconstitution and create new coves.
In addition to the genetic evidence of natural resonance, according to H▁अधिकारVU1 and HOC3, animals like bats,SL-▁माध्यमVVVC4 and batsman Co-HU9 have been found.
With regard to transferivity, there's mutual co-friend action.
Apart from the three main factors mentioned above, there is another important factor which affects interconnection of interconnected media.
Here, again of SARS-EV is seen as a general example which showed positive elections during interverse events.
On the basis of comparison between humans and SeatSS-Councents, specially on the RBD mutations of SARS -RRB-, SRS-V is considered to be developing faster in different units.
Normally, in a sequence of proteins, RBD works together with the authority and with intensity it is selected by a sustainable reaction
In the SARS-EV, RBD S1 section on 318th section is in acid, which connects with human ACC2 for the entry of Vairal.
SARS-OV is capable of identifying the ACE2 genotypes of different species of animals, including RBDB, Sivat, ratha and rajaon dogs, by which viruses are interconnected.
In fact, only 6 ambient acids were seen different from humans and sympathies in RBD and 4 ASE2 are located in inter-dependable fundamentality for collaboration with each other.
Seavet SARS-EV contains K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the attraction of running proteins along with human ACE2 engineers.
In other words, these two are important in adaptation of Vairal in humans.
It is remarkable that SARS-EV2, SARS-PAV shares the same neurologicalist.
In S1 unit of protein SARS-EV2 and SARS-EV, 30% of differences between them point out that the combination of protein can be changed with human ACC2.
In fact, 19 to 20 times more attraction than the combination between the human ASE2 and SARS-VSS protein is indicated.
It will also be interesting to determine whether there will be any other user required for SARS-EV-2 succession.
Interestingly, H▁अधिकारV-NAL63 also connects with ASCE2, but from different parts of S.
There are many other HRPV Institutes, e.g. H▁अधिकारV-229E, and there are 9-O-so-metal sinic acids for H.V.229.
They can also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after their cattle have grown to feed their animals.
The result of the interconnection of▁शांतिVs is controlled by other nutrients and restrictions apart from the Compensation Institute.
Nature's natural nutrients, such as batsmen, bugs and bugs, can interfere with the difference between these nutrients.
For the successful interconnection of the H▁अधिकारVs, there is to be a repercussions of nutrients and nutrients factors.
In this respect, there is still time to recognise and describe the molecular forces in this important area of inter-combination.
Using the latest technology of CRISPR through use of SARS-EV-2 organic dependence and restriction factors, non-organized genotype test can be fruitful.
Power of NovelHVs: return on fundamental basis.
The diversity of batsmans provides ample opportunity for the inspiration of Nanval HRPS.
In this sense, batsman works as the gene of penis.
At the same time, due to rapid mutation and genetic repercussion, there is growth of HRPV and this process works for two important stages.
For example, there is the ability to change the number of proteins-relief chromosomes or damages.
In the SARS-PVOT helpful proteins, ORF8 has been considered important among humans because, since the SARS-EVV-AARC▁दास▁दास▁दासinated viruses were separated, but they were found to enforce various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-UVS 29-NewColatide's feature is found in different species at the beginning of human epidemic.
It breaks ORF8 and breaks ORF8a and STF8b and it is considered as adaptation mutation which stimulates converting cells.
Apart from this, there are possible renunciation history along with SARS-EPA-EVOVS▁खाताionionion, in which RNA-based RNAP has been recognised by a large number of smaller renunciation areas.
np9, most of the np10, and np14 parts have been identified.
Similarly, it has been seen that the epidemic, MERS-EV, has experienced regeneration events between different genotypes which took place in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS(USV) and MSSV, reproportionation events have been seen in other HRPVs, in which HNCs repeat other animals along with their non-organical genes.
Even so, there should be caution that artificial elections can change in Vairal Gnome, perhaps due to free viruses from elections, such as▁उपयोग▁उपयोग defence systems.
One example of these effects is the loss of HyV-229 engineering species which is full length of 3.4.
whereas H▁अधिकारV-229E related to batsman and camel viruses can be seen on ORF4, necekata alpha-▁महत्त्वपूर्ण nucleide entry shows single numeral entry which is framed.
At the end but not less important, the gradual development of Novell HVs is also under pressure from election in its cochals.
Signsless or only light signs were shown when batsmen were infected by CoVs which points to mutual adaptation between bats and batsmen.
It seemed that batsmen were quite well-defined to CoVs in terms of structure and physical.
For example, in the batsmen there are▁दो-influent reactions in the process, the disease caused by the ComVs is effectively reduced.
Apart from this, natural deadly cell activity in the batsmen is controlled by natural fatal cells called cellular cells, NG2/CD94, and the main tissues are affected due to the following expression of complex genotype of molecules.
Apart from this, due to greater mechanical activity of batting of batsman(ROS), there can be repression of emission of carbon from the upper level of blood, and affects the reading and reading by Anglo-American>. Thus, when entering into new nutrients, there is pressure for the production of highly transmitted viruses.
There can also be more diabetic cells due to which new proteins or proteins can be obtained by renunciation.
So, it's not surprising that in the last two decades three Nanval HRPs have emerged.
Coves bats and camels like kash are non-officials or produce light signs.
without showing strong nutrients resistance, they make these specimens firmly.
In this the secret is to hide why there are signs which are not visible and why serious cases occur in human infection.
The serious symptoms are mainly due to defence response and circum, which contains more protective response, as serious lungs damage.
On the other hand, in rare numbers, defence response is different from CoV review.
The same strategy to separate defence response can have beneficial effects on▁डाकeconomic surgery.
Interferon response is particularly rapid in batting.
Therefore, in humans, Type IEFON's administration should be useful at least in the initial phase of SARS-EV-2 infection.
At the same time, the NLRP3 in the batsmen have an active defect.
With this logic, NLRP3 is useful in terms of COVID-19 with MCC950.
SARS-EV-2 broadcastes the same common subject which produces SARS-EPAV.
While batsman's SARS-EV has seen 95% news equality along with the NCPV, there is also 96% news equality with batsman
While in markets, Seawets and other animals have been seen providing shelter to viruses like SARS-EV, they have not been identified by the nearest consolidated provisions of SARS-EV-2.
SARS-OV-2 has been▁जवाबed surprisingly similar▁निकटulin Beta-Cooperation, which indicates that there can be one of subsidiary organisations or in the final version of RSS-Cooperation(SROV-2).
Although the question remains, there is no evidence that SARS-EV-2 has been made deliberately or naturally created by human beings.
CoVs, SARS-EV-2 has come into discussion due to recent anger.
There has been a lot of change in our understanding of the animal chromosomes in the batsman and other animals from the study of Corvs.
The widespread evidence has seen that SARS-EV, MSSV and SARS-EV-2 are the primary batsman of the universe and that the difference between humans is due to interconnections.
Seeing that the infection of SARS-EV occurs due to contact between the markets between humans and the Seats, Vot(weet) markets were to be stopped and there SARS epidemic was to be eliminated effectively by killing SARS.
That's why, SARS-EV-2, thanks to the discovery of a lot of genotypes from the Vedic market should be removed from the Vedala market.
However, whether SARS-EV-2 voicelin and other breasts are transmitted into human beings and how the future will be clarified.
On the other hand, MERS-EV has entered camels with camels for decades.
These camels are important means of transport for local people, along with meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely spread in Middle East and Africa.
Therefore it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MSS like SARS(RSV and SARS-CoV-2) in China's wild markets to stop broadcasting.
There should be a comprehensive approach to develop effective TW against MERS in addition to other infections control measures to prevent the anger caused by MERS.
Because we are not able to end these viruses, new genes can arise to cause anger.
Different animals are roaming into wild animals.
Specially, batsmen with animal capacity are very diverse.
It is quite likely that these animalic development and rejuvenation of the co-ordination of these animals, which will emerge from new components which will be more contagious and/or fatal in future in human beings.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, some parts of China have to abandon the culture of food.
SARS, MSS and COVID-19 with difficult examinations, better preparation and response planning should be made.
In fact, many viruses have been happening on planet Earth for a long time.
They remain in their natural structure until there is no possibility of expanding.
Though there are many features of batsmen which help spread viruses, if people are taught to stay away from batsmen then they can be at least able to communicate with human beings and other wild species.
For better understanding of cVs and their natural nutrients, constant surveillance of mammals is necessary, which will be useful in preventing the horror of the animal.
Finally, the most effective way of preventing air animal disease is to stay away from the ecological habitats of human beings.
SARS-EV-2 are still missing from many parts of the puzzles.
First, if batsman transmit the fluctuation virus from SARS-EV-2 into▁निकटlinal, then it will be interesting to see under what circumstances the batsman and Jaillin can share the same ecological home.
Secondly, if batsman plays direct role in human movement, then it should be decided how man comes into contact with batsmen.
Thirdly, if a third animal acts as real sustainable then it should be made clear how this affects different species including humans, batsmen and Jamlins.
Finally, because many mammals including domestic animals can be interested in SARS-EV-2, surveillance and technology infection should be done both.
Whether it is batsman, zinlin or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-EV-2 or its christic viruses which are almost equal will be identified in future in their natural nutrients.
Regular investigation in this area will explain the gradual development methods in animals along with the prevention and control of COVID-19.
COVID-19'sdeciable matters and assured matters need to be updated
On 6th February 2020, our team published a quick advice direction for the diagnosis of infection(2019-NV) and treatment of infection, and this direction provides appropriate reference to our experience and to fight this epidemic worldwide.
However, Coronnis disease is a new disease in 2019(COVID-19), our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the experiences of research and clinical practice ; hence, the strategy of treatment and treatment are continually updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our direction, and according to the latest diagnosis and treatment direction of COVID-19, according to COVID -LRB- NIX edition -RRB- and the latest clinical value of the case is available.
In December 2019, 2019 Noval Konnis(2019-NV), which is now officially referred to coronais disease 2019(COVID-1919), and the virus has been given the name of severe respiratory syndrome(SARSSOURB-2).
On 11th March 2020, WHO has marked COVID-19 as an epidemic.
From SARS-EV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice direction and has been published online on February 2020 on military research.
Ever since it was published, it has attracted much attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information are gradually increasing on the basis of the findings of research and the experience of clinical practice ; hence, the strategy of treatment and treatment is constantly being updated.
For example, in 16th January 2020 to 3th March 2020, the National Health Committee of the Chinese People Republic has issued seven editions with basic changes in context.
Now, on our direction, a comment has been made by Pratal, he has presented a simple issue on the basis of his clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our direction and made valuable reference to this epidemic worldwide.
We support his important work and express our gratitude.
However, his work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19.
According to the seventh edition(3th March 2020), for ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the case, any item of the epidemic history needs to be organised with two items of clinical expression ; or if clear epidemics occur without history, three items are required to meet:
Disease History: (1) Urban city and area of surrounding areas, or other communities where the history of travel or residence was indicated in 14 days before the advent of symptoms ; (2) The history of contact with SARS-V-2 infectious cases(with information related to information from around the city and around the area of the city, or from other communities where the symptoms of infection were introduced during the past 14-30 days ; the number of contacts between groups, including small groups of groups of groups, including 2,2 weeks, etc.
Vedic expressions: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with visual facilities reflected in COVID-19▁समर्पित (3) the number of white blood cells in early stages shows normal, deficiency or fluorphousation.
The diagnosis of the matter has to be based on one of the suspect cases of disease or Critic evidence which are following: (1) Real-time examination comes from PCR2; (2) Weral shows a higher contrast with all known genotypes. (3) In CMS-R2 for special tests, i.P.P.P.A.(For example, i.P.P.S.A.) and i.D.A.A.(E. i.S.A.S.A.A.A.) ; i.D.T.T.D.
We can see that in the specimens of Sivason System or Blood, there was a real-time PCR test added to the second(18 January 2020) and third(22 January 22 January 2020) versions.
Blood specimens' diabetic identification was added to fourth(27 January 2020) and fifth(8 February 2020); and then in the seventh edition there was a certificate added.
These amendments were based on the continued work of researchers, which ensure that the best new acid recognition for rapid diagnosis, along with blood specimens, search specimens, which increase the availability of different specimens, and support the confirmation result.
Also, there are many evidences which remind us to take care of the symptoms of anthropology and random patients.
Therefore, the flow chart should be updated because they have classified the person with non-cooperative symptoms as a risk.
Score system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As we conclude, we hope more direct evidences will appear and invite readers to give their comments.
For the▁किताबance of theIndian matters and 'Hindi matters, we suggest examining and complying with the latest directions of their home countries.
Our team will also update its directions from time to time to offer help.
There were five new deaths in Bangladesh since COVID-19, so far the most common data
Kal, Bangladesh has confirmed five more deaths in one day from COVID-19.
This is the largest figure of deaths due to this virus in one day.
Upto-day, Bangladesh's Institute of Asidumology, Report Control and Research (IDECR) reported the number of registered cases, 114 active cases and 33 people who were cured during their home illness.
Till now all 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online newspaper Briffling, Dr. Mirzabir Harriana told that four men and a woman died.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two patients aged over 60, two from 51 to 60 and one was between 41 to 50 years of age.
He also told that there were two of those who died.
World Health Organization(WHO) has declared a global epidemic on March 11

On Saturday, in an online video declaration, Bangladesh's road transport and bridge minister UBI said that the road transport will be kept closed for longer than the planning of the next Saturday.
This public transport was started on March 26 and it was to end on Saturday, 4th April.
There was no preventable transport of medical products, fuels and food.
In Bangladesh, two people returned from Italy on 8 March, and one of them got recorded in his wife.
On 19th March they had recovered.
across the world around SARS-EV-2 cases of infection across one million
John Balis University data shows that on Thursday, on Thursday, all over the world, the total number of infections of SARS-EV-2 got crossed one million.
Corona disease caused by virus is being linked to at least 52 thousand deaths.
On the day when this figure was crossed, the first corona virus in Malawi and the first death caused by Corona virus in Zimbabwe has been reported.
North Korea claimed that till Thursday he was involved in some countries which are still free from viruses.
Till tomorrow the World Health Organization has reported 105,635 cases, which include 48 hours prior to April 4th April 10(08500%)
There are more than 2 million cases recorded in America, and at least 5,900 deaths have occurred.
CBS News told the statistics of John Balis University that Wednesday, Colona virus infection has killed over 1,000 deaths in America.
All over the world countries have declared even more harsh measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Mohammed's May May May May, May's May May May May May
At national level President Valla Pratin announced that till 30 April, the Russians would continue to get paid without going to work.

Saudi Arabia has spent twenty-four hours in holy Mecca and Medina cities. The time of Karfhu was from 3am to 6 p.m. in the morning.
Thailand has planned to make Karphage from 10 p.m. to 4 o'clock in the morning.
Christ's Governor Mike Drugin announced that the order to stay at home in the state was expanded till 1 May.
In Australia stores lost the number of toilet papers that could be bought at a time.
On Sundays and Saturday evenings, Australiai stores districts and Coals have reduced the number of toilet papers available at one time in all of their stores on national level.
ALDI also applied to one-payer's limit on Monday.
These borders were posted on checkout sites and on series Facebook pages.
It is said that the buyers were collecting shopping together to keep themselves separate due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Valulford also limited the limits of buying toilet paper for home delivery.
Before these changes there was a ban on buying maximum four packs at once on 4 and 5 Marchs.
Kolkalas in his 8th March issue said that despite the restrictions of the four-payer, even though lots of stores are being completed within an hour of delivery,and this demand was told earlier by ALDI in a Tuesday leaflet
According to a spokesman from Varworths, last week in sales, there was a big leap.
Kalpana store which was situated at Kanbara also limited the length of the week to two packs last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coals gave orders to solvents and big package and increased the amount of delivery. Wilkins also ordered additional stock, where ALDI gathered stock to make quick access to the former Wednesday special.
The Executive Director of Australia, Rasell Zurmerman, said that he should try to increase Rillar Stock, but it becomes difficult to do this because of the restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of the truck delivery.
In this case when solvents are trying to meet demand and the special number has been reduced already, it is expected that Resell should increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after release of stock before time, some stores could not operate on Wednesday specials.
News News.com's report says that there's a▁पायाland university expert Dr. Motmier said he fills the stores every night.
He said that the toilet paper is a big item, so it doesn't get stock in large numbers, and then, when it's sold the entire stock, there are large bags left blank, which makes sense and harden.
According to ABC News, Rasel Zurmerman said,It is the idea of kocos and Vultons(that if there were lots of goods on the lap, and products like toilet paper and sanskrit, etc.) could probably be reduced if there were large quantities of disturbances.
Hu Givins A▁संपर्क▁संपर्कapp told last Wednesday that their stock was over.
According to News.com.Au report, the company making health, toilet, cooker,and sol▁मिला▁मिलाis paper told that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
A real estate site.com told us that there were less blues being used because of the annual holidays on the days of labour days, some of the property sellers are giving free toilet papers to those who speak the first.
One of the daily, NTT News edition published in Darwin, was one of eight pages which were given to cut off the toilet paper.
According to ABC report on 3th March, Australia was initially not willing to ban the storage. In this report he said that he had no plans to ban shopping.
Raseljamerman further said that there is great demand for other products, including masks, sanctators, dry things, heweds and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday evenings outside Australia, online British Supermarket, Ocockdo also bought the Andaray hospital toilet paper, but two packs of 12-roles were applied.
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 global epidemic
On Wednesday, World Health Organization(WHO) has declared global epidemic.
However, the word world epidemic means only how far any disease spreads, not how dangerous its particular case is, but that WHO has discussed the need to move governments to act.
All countries can still change the way of global epidemic.
If country finds out the disease in response to it, treat patients, keep them apart, give them a clue and unite them together, it was said that India's Great Democratic Tendromyysis of WHO.
We're worried about the high level of expansion and seriousness, both of which are concerned.
According to Dr. Tom Priden, former director of American disease control and prevention centres, this is a global epidemic.
In remarks published by CCN in February, he said, There is no trace of other respiratory virus which has not been done in continuous global spread.
Gabrisis expressed similar ideas when he said, We haven't seen any global epidemic that happens to us till now.
He added,And we haven't seen any global epidemic that can be controlled at that time.
This new post of global epidemic is given in January after the global public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fautch, director of U.S. National Disease and infectious Disease Institute, said about anger:One thing, it's going to get worse.
The Associated Press said that till Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases across the world of COVID-19 and as a result there were more than 4,600 deaths.
20192009 Cornnis epidemic is a epidemic due to severe respiratory syndrome 2(SARS-Cooperation(COID-192).
In December 2019, its fury was identified, which was declared international health emergency on 30th January 2020 and it was declared as epidemic on 11th March 2020.
Till 10 April 2020, around 1.6 million cases of COVID-19 have been indicated in 210 countries and areas, resulting in nearly 97000 deaths.
around 364,000 people have recovered.
In China, the death rate of the case has been estimated 4%, whereas on the world level it is from 13.4% to 13.08% in New Zealand.
General symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
In complexity, pneumonia and acute respiratory crisis may include syndrome.
From coming into contact with virus until the beginning of symptoms is about five days, but this can happen from two to fourteen days.
It doesn't have any known vaccines or special antivisal treatment.
Primary treatment is biological and helpful medical. The best measures include washing your hands, keeping your hands covered when eating, keeping distance from other people and providing surveillance and self-control for people who are suspected of infection.
All over the world's authorities have responded by implementing travel restrictions, transportation, housing, workplace control and facilities.
This epidemic has produced serious global social disorder, has caused religious, political and cultural organisations to be suspended or rejected, and has caused great loss in supply by making quick shopping purchases.
In 193 countries schools and universities are closed on a wide or local basis, which affects almost 99.4 per cent of students of the world.
Wrong information about viruses has spread online, and things have happened against other people of China, East Asia, Eastern Asian and other parts of Africa, and more viruses.
due to low travel and heavy industry closed, air pollution and carbon emissions have declined.
In China, health authorities reported the collective cases of polio due to unknown causes on 31 December,19 and started on January 2020.
Most of the cases were connected with Huan Sea Food market and therefore the virus is considered to be an animal.
The virus which causes anger is known as SARS-EV-2, which is a new virus which is closely connected with batsoons,▁बढ़करolinos and SARSV. Later on 1st December 2019, the first person with symptoms was diagnosed with disease, and there was no connection with the group that followed the man's food market.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases mentioned in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13th March 2020, a press report of South China's Jail Post stated that on 17th November,19 there was a case of 55-year-old person in Hube Pradesh, which could be the first case. On 26th February, 2010, WHO pointed out that there was a sudden increase in China's new cases in Italy and South Korea, Iran and South Korea. Outside China's new cases, the first number of cases was more than the number of cases of China.
In particular people with slight symptoms, there may be very little notice of cases.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases in young people, 19 years and less than 2.4% of them were of the world's affairs. Main scientist of the United Kingdom, Patrick Sensants, estimated that 60% of British population would need to be infected before winning the effective group.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested in COVID-19 and according to the official protocol which has been confirmed by the patient.
Till March 23 no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries like Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies that they should not test only light people.
A study published on 16th March found that in China, till 23 January, 86% were not detected, COVID-1919 infections, and that these unofficial infections were sources of infection for 79% cases.
In a statistics analysis published on March 30, it was estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was much higher than the cases indicated.
COVID-19 was the initial estimate of primary breeding number(R0) for COR4 to 2.4.
In a study published by U.S. disease control and prevention Centre, it has been concluded that it can be 5.7.
COVID-1919% of people recover.
Which are not correct, the time has been between 6 and 41 days since development of symptoms, which are the most common 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, COVID-19 was the cause of the deaths of about 970,000 people.
In China, up to 5th February, nearly 80% of deaths were in people aged over 60, and there were cases of heart disease and diabetes. The official calculations of the death due to COVID-1919 were generally referred to the deaths caused by the official protocol for COVID.
From COVID-19 onwards actual death numbers can be very high, because there can't be people who die without testing, such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
In part of Italy's statistics found that additional deaths which occur during epidemic are 4-5 times higher than COVID deaths.
A spokesman of American disease control and prevention(CDC) said,We know that(called death number) has been created. One statement, which is supported by short calculation information in America, is often due to this kind of epidemic, such as in 2009 H1वinवव9ववववववववेववपपपपननोतततततततततततततततततततततततततततततेेेेेेेतततततततततेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेरररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेेे
The main land died outside China on February 1 and the first died outside Asia on February 14th February.
Till 28 February, the main land was registered outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy, with more than a dozen deaths.
By 13th March, apart from Antarctica, every continent had been informed about death in more than forty countries and regions. Normally there are many ways to determine death rate.
These numbers vary according to sectors and time, and the quantity of tests, quality of health system, options of treatment, time and population are affected by age, sex and overall health. Death ratio shows the number of deaths which occur within a fixed period of time.
Based on data from John Balis University, there is global death ratio till 10 April 2020 6.0%(97,09/1,617,204)
This number changes according to the field.
In China, death ratio is estimated to be 17.3%(for those who died from symptoms 1-10th January 2020) due to 07%(which were started after February 120). In other ways cases, death rate is included, which shows percentage of people who died from a disease(CR) and mortality rate, which is caused by an infectious disease, caused by an infectious disease, by an active non-depressed people.
These statistics are not recorded time and from infection to recovery they follow a specific population.
Many educational experts have tried to calculate these numbers for specific organisations.
University of Oxford Centre for Developments -▁रिश्dhary Medicine estimates that there is a total mortality rate of 0.5% between 2000% and 0.139%.
The upper assumption of this limitation in Germany is in keeping with the results of a statistics based on a series of tests in the first half of COVID-19 and the effect of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that epidemic can be controlled.
The extreme and final duration of anger is uncertain and can be different according to place.
Says McKee of Pen State University, When you give up disobedience, you can usually get infected normally and when there is no provision available for disease, they start to fall down.
But when it happens, it's almost impossible to figure out when it's going to happen.
China Government's senior medical adviser Jag Nahan argued that it could end up till June, if all countries followed the advice of WHO on preventing the spread of viruses.
On 17 March, Adam Kushkary of the London School of Hyjin and Trophal Medicine said that SARS-EV-2 is going to stay enquiry for one or two years.
According to the study of Imperial College under the leadership of the Indian Empire, building and other measures will be required till there is a vaccine available(like 18 months or more).
Says William Sheffner of Wenderbel University:I think it doesn't think it's going to end up entirely because it's very easy to spread And this can change 'mus' disease which comes back every year.
The fierceness of coming back will depend on the limits of defence and mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively different and infected people can be random.
Two common symptoms are fever(888%), and dry cough(68%).
There are less common symptoms: fatigue, bronchitis production(f), shortness of smell, irrigation, sweating and joints, pain in the throat, headaches, swellings, swellings, swellings, swellings, swellings, swellings, swelling of blood pressure, fluctuation,▁लियेemity. According to WHO, nearly one person becomes seriously ill and gets difficulty in breathing.
The U.S. disease control and prevention center, the difficulty in breathing symptoms, pain or strain in chest, sudden disturbances, suddenness of face and lips, gives advice to medical care immediately when these symptoms occur. Most of this disease is serious illness, severe respiratory illness, respiratory illness, strokes, strokes and strokes can occur from lung cancer and strokes.
Some of the infected people may be aware of which there are no clinical symptoms, but test results, so researchers have suggested that close surveillance and investigation should be made in order to avoid infection.
The Chinese estimate of the random ratio is from some to 44%.
General Disease duration(when between the beginning of the stage and the beginning of the symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is generally five days. One example of uncertainty is the guess of COVID-19% people who lost their sense of smell was 30% and after that 15%.
Some details about how disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease occurs mainly during contact and during coughing, coughing or talking(3 to 6 meters) by small drops when contact between 1 to 6 meters(3 to 6 feet).
Studies found that the drops from 4.5 meter(15 ft) to 8.2 meter(27 ft).
Some people have proposed that the virus can be spread by small drops which occur in the air for longer periods. During the time they leave it, the virus is not usually infected.
sperms can go into the mouth or nose of those who are near or maybe through breathing in lungs.
Some medical processes like tube entry and heart▁बल्किic surgery(CPR(CPR) can result in respiratory discharge and can thus be transmitted by air transfer.
This can spread even when a person touches a polluted surface with skin, then touches his eyes, nose or nose.
Even though these concerns are that it can spread by sewage, its risk is less considered to be less.
The China Government has rejected the possibility of sARS-EV-2 infrastructure. After the commencement of virus symptoms the most contagious during the first three days, although before symptoms appear and after disease, communication can be possible.
Before the beginning of symptoms three days there have been tests for people's disease, which tells us that before developing important symptoms it is possible.
There are only a few reports from Al Qaida cases confirmed in the lab, but during investigations of contacts, some countries have been identified by the amicable assessment.
According to the European Disease Procedure and Control Center(ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easy it is to spread, a person usually kills two or three persons. This virus lives from hours to hours.
In particular, viruses were found capable of detecting plastics and 304kales on steel for three days, for one day on cardboard, and for four hours on copper.
However, it is different on the basis of humidity and temperature. There are experiments for pet animals and other animals for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that viruses can go from animals to humans, although British authorities advise them to wash their hands after contact with animals like infected by infected persons after contact with other surfaces.
Heavy blood pressure syndrome is two(SARS-EV) new virus which is first isolated from the group of diabetic cases in Wuan.
No.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.V-2 viruses all features are found in coronas related to nature.
It is believed that this is an animal virus.
It turns out that Colonnis is a group of two batsmanas with genetically two batsmen and two batsmansmen, Upanishads, Upanishads(Desavali B).
This is equal to 96% of other batsmanic specimens at the entire Gnome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a difference between viruses and humans in some parts of genotype sequences.
Till now, in full genome compared to Jain Colonanis and SARS-EV-2 common material has been found, maximum 92% of which is inadequate to make the Jamchlin available.
The address of infection by the virus can be laid on the basis of symptoms, although the confirmation is finally due to the transferion of infected▁प्रतिeememphation chain(rRT-PR) or STPR images.
One study compared to PCR in VUCR has suggested that CTCR is very sensitive compared to PCR, though many of its images are similar to other chromosomes and disease processes, this is less specific.
By March 2020, American College of Radiopolitanji has proposed that OVID-19 should not be used as primary tests for examination or diagnosis
WHO published many RNA test protocol for SARS-EV-2, whose first edition was issued on 17th January.
This test uses real-time stream transferment,▁शब्दememphide chain(rTR-RPR)(rTR).
This test can be done on specimens of Sivason or blood.
Results usually become available within hours of hours.
Generally this test is done on NASA Gramni font, but it can also be used as a throat. Many labs and companies are developing a series of digital tests which can be traced to the user.
6 April 2020, none of them have proved sufficient accuracy to use widely.
In the United States, a series of experiments developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by established labs.
Feathant people's radioography and computed Tomography(CT) are also included in such features as Asomyd▁प्रयोगicides, sulphur oxides, and lower fertilising compounds.
The Mexican Radiographic Society is introducing an international online database of conclusions to confirm cases.
Due to equality with other infections like Edennis, without confirmation of PCR, there is a limited characteristic of the image in identifying COVID-19.
In a large study in China, compared with PCR's consequences and showed that while image is less specific for infection, this is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its idea as a screening instrument in the epidemic sector.
With both radioography and KTT, artificial knowledge-based neuron network has been developed to detect the image of viruses.
In order to ward off diseases, the strategy includes maintaining good hygiene, washing hands, washing hands, noses or noses without washing hands and touching the mouth without washing hands ; and in one bottle, eating or sniffing, and putting that fluctuation directly into garbage boxes.
People who are already infected are advised to wear solvent masks in public places.
There are ways to create the physical distance to prevent the movement. Many governments have banned all non-official activities in countries and areas, or are not advised to go away.
However, viruses have reached the level of community movement in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community don't know where and how they are infected. The care providers who care about an infected person are advised to take care of standards, to protect contacts and to protect their eyes. The source of infection is available for health authority.
For this purpose the use of mobile phones has increased concern by using data, for which more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement on the limits of this type of surveillance.
For voluntary use different mobile organisations are installed or proposed, and till 7th April 2020, a dozen specialist groups were working on confidential organisation solutions, such as using blue to log closer to each user's cell phone.
users get a message if they are in touch with someone who has got COVID(19191). Wrong ideas about prevention are spreading; for example, touching noses and storing with mouthshsh is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organisations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended for preventing diseaseization.
CDC discusses that people should wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after toilet, or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and before washing,▁मानेing,▁लगीing or sniffing.
This is because outside the human body, viruses are killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
Apart from this, CDC has recommended at least 60% of computerized computer use, while soap and water are not available easily.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or nose without washing their hands.
On surfaces 62.71% Ithane, 50100% of methane, 0.5% of sodium Hypox, 0.15% hydrogen monoxide, and 0.5% of Povindo-Exine can be excluded from many medicines(in addition to one steel surface, within one minute of toilet.
Other bugs, like Benusalcoium chlooride and cluxidin, low effective.
CDC points out that if there is doubt or confirmation of a COVID case on facility like a office or a Deputy facility then all areas like offices, toilets, public places, electronic equipment, electronic devices, electronic screens, audio screens, telephones, remote controls and ill people should be used without any HTML machinery etc.
Health organisation decides that people should take their mouth and nose by turning their mouth or nose off when they bite or by touching it, and then deal immediately with any▁जाता.
It is recommended for people who can get infected because it can reduce the amount of drop from breathing through brushing, coughing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on how and when to use masks.
According to Professor Stephen Griffin of University of Leedas, Mocking can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper sanitation, the masks are also used by people who are suffering from disease.
WHO has suggested to healthy people to wear masks only if they are in high risk, like those who care about COVID-19, but they also admit that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of mouth mask by ordinary people.
In America(3 ft(3 ft) has been recommended by China to wear masks of non-cooperative faces made of CDC cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of normal health masks, especially when they come close to other people(3 meter(3 f) or less).
While using public transport or staying in crowded places, Hugh is recommended to wear video clips(
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech republic and▁पैदाan has banned without mask or nose and nose without turning out to public places.
On 16th March, Vietnam has requested to wear the face mask when going to public areas for protection of others.
The Austrian Government has mandatory to wear facilitating masks of everyone entering the kitchen shop.
Israel asked all citizens to wear face mask when going into the public sector.
Every day after March, Taiwan which produced 10 million masks has made it obligatory to wear facial masks by passengers in railways and remote buses on April 1.
Paja has made it obligatory to wear facial masks when he goes out, while he has been recommended for people who can't buy facial masks.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore has also been widely used.
Social distance(also called physical distance) includes infection control work, which means reducing contact between people by reducing the spread of disease.
Its ways include Quentin; travel restrictions; schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centres.
By staying at home, reducing the journey, avoiding crowds and communities, using no contact, and taking ourselves away from others through physical distance.
Many governments are now making it mandatory or mandatory to make social distances in affected areas.
Due to increase in maximum population of American government bodies and health organisations, 250 people(if there was no known COVID-19▁समर्पित) were to 50 people, and after that 10 were ton't done.
On 22th March 2020, Germany banned more than two people's public population. Older adults, diabetics, heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood pressure, and other immune systems are more susceptible to serious diseases and complications and are advised by CDC to stay in communities where they can be in home as much as they can. In the end of March 2020, and other members of India have banned the wordto make use of diabetes so that they can keep social contact
With the use of the wordto create communal distance, people should adopt full social isolation instead of encouraging others to live in contact with them through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual guidelines for use during epidemic.
These include only persons with you who don't have viruses or viruses.
For COVID-19 people and people who are suspected of infection, self-organization is recommended at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-organisation. Many governments have compulsory or recommended self-convention for the whole population of affected areas.
In high risk groups, maximum self-convention instructions have been issued.
person who comes into contact with someone infected from COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or area where there is a wide majority have been advised to use self-convention for 14 days from the last possible risk.
The strategy of control of a rage is constituent or repression, etc.
During the early stages of anger, there is an emergency and its aim is to detect infected people and also to implement other measures and measures to control infection so that the disease can be prevented from spread into the rest of the population.
When the spread of disease is not possible, then efforts are taken to slow the spread and health system and to reduce its effects on society.
These two measures can be combined at the same time.
There is an urgent need for repression, so that the primary reproduction rate can be reduced by 1 to reverse the epidemic. One part of HIV infection is to try to reduce the extent of epidemic, which is known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services and gives more time to develop Tacks and treatments.
Non-official interventions which can manage anger include personal preventive measures such as washing hands, masking and self-convention. To close the schools and abolish mass assembly programmes; to encourage acceptance and participation in such interferences there is community participation; along with environmental measures such as environmental environmental conditions such as anger is more severe in the cause of China. When there was serious adverse effects, such as washing of hands, washing hands, washing hands, washing the face, etc.
Other countries also adopted various measures to limit the spread of viruses.
South Korea started a large range of investigations and local constituents and passed warnings on the sound of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial aid for infected people who have treated themselves like Quarton and those who failed to do this have got a fine on them.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished medical supplies. Great Britain and America follow that the spread of mausoleum(not to slow the spread of mausoleum) and that there are great challenges in the development of repression
Bollywood policies can reduce the demand for high health care by 2/3 and by half, but after this hundreds of people die and health systems are eliminated.
Politics can be given priority, but it needs to be maintained till the virus is spread to human population(or until there is a vaccine available), if it is before, otherwise it returns slowly towards measures.
There are long-term interventions to suppress epidemic, social and economic costs.
For COVID-19, there are no specific anti▁मददal drugs approved, but there are efforts to develop with the examination of existing drugs.
Taking drugs without prescriptions, drinking fluids and rest can help reduce symptoms.
On the basis of seriousness, oxygen therapy, fluctuations and respiratory aid may be required.
The results can be worse due to the use of stree.
Many compounds which are already approved for treating other diseases are being examined for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to WHO, some of the symptoms caused due to SARS-EV-19 can be relieved.
COVID-199 patients have developed capacity for health care and it is described as a basic▁दुखation response by WHO.
The European Regional Office of ECDC and WHO has issued guidelines for transfer of resources for hospitals and primary health care services in many levels, including: to focus on the lab services on COVID-19 testing, whenever possible, to cancel elective processes, to separate and separate those infected persons by COVID-1919 ; and to increase the capacity by training of workers, and to increase the number and increase the number of workers.
There are many votes about where the first case can be born.
Noval Coonenis first known case was identified in Vauhan, Hubei, China in 1st December 2019.
Within a month, the number of cases in Huboli increased gradually.
These were mostly connected with the marine market, which was sold to living animals, and one opinion is that viruses came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is from the root of the wild animals.

Sylvon Cornnis disease 2019(COVID-19), and related SARS-EV-2 viruses, to detect the presence of viruses and to respond to infection systems are included.
specimens confirm the presence of viruses by RT-PCR, which detect the RNA of Coronnis.
This check is specific and only SARS-EV-2 virus has been created to detect RNA.
This is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Analysis can be used for detectation and monitoring of people.
Tests show how many people have been infected, including people who were very light to indicate symptoms or who were lacking symptoms.
Due to the results of this investigation, the exact death rate of disease and the level of collective resistance among people can be determined.
Due to limited scrutiny, till March 2020 no country had reliable data on the spread of viruses.
Till 23 March, no country has investigated more than 3% of its population and how much research has been done in different countries, there are many differences in this.
There is also the possibility of affecting the death rate of matters indicated by this diversity, which is expected to be estimated more effectively in some countries.
Real-time River's Transliteration▁चारोंeem▁चारों▁चारोंemention(rRT-PCCR)(rRCR)(rRT-PR) can be checked on various methods obtained by the specimens of NASAgregative Font or Balasagata.
generally results become available from a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR investigation with the legs of the throat is reliable in the first week of the disease.
afterwards virus can disappear from throat, whereas it continues to grow in lungs.
In the second week, for infected people, alternative specimens can be taken from inside or used from inside by Cholusa Cathar.
Real-time River's Transliteration▁चारोंeem▁चारों▁चारोंement(rTRCR) was developed in Calcutta in January 2020, and by World Health Organization, it became the basis of the distribution of 250,000 insects.
The United Kingdom also developed the test test for 23th January 2020. South Korea's Company Koganbatoc developed a negligible category on 28th January 2020, PCR- based SR-SV-2 Examination Act.
This all beta is the first one in the United States, which has been shared by Korogennis(E),D.D.D.D.S.VV-2.2 ; in China, the BGI group, with the National Medical Procedure of China's National Institutes Act, PRC-GRV- Examination, Inc., was the first one of the companies who accepted the emergency. In the United States, there were pre-President Control Center(C-C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.A.C.A(C.)(C.).
Three of the three genotypes of test found that there were no scientific results in one of the three genotypes and created problems with CDC investigation. Because of this, the average average of processed specimens conducted during February 2020 was less than 100 in one day.
Tests using two components were not trusted till 28 February 2020 and were not allowed to start testing of state and local labs.
Under emergency use authority, testing was adopted by Food and Medicine Administration.US Business labs started checking on March 2020.
Up to 5th March 2020, Lab▁तर्क announced the availability of COVID-19 based on RT-PPR.
Quest Diagnosis made COVID-19 available throughout the country till 9th March 2020.
None of these quantities were announced; the collecting and processing of specimens should be done according to the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, research of COVID-19 was developed and produced by the Department of Research Center of Science and Technology VECTOR.
On 11th February 2020 this investigation was registered by the Federal Service for Health. On 12th March 20, 2020 information was given to develop an investigation to detect a COVID-19. 13th March, 2008, Rs 2020, Rs▁प्रजाsexes, got permission from FDA for a high scale within 3.5 hours, as a result of this machine can be checked within 24 hours.
On 19th March 2020, FDA has issued emergency use authority(UA) to check on the m2000 system. FDA has already issued similar authority to Hozik, Labik(Experary),
On 21th March 2020, Shefida obtained a test from FDA in which it takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test, in which there is the use of Ice▁वक्तlo▁सहायकic acid acid▁वक्तphic acid technology instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't need a series of changing temperature cycles, this system can lead to a positive result in less than five minutes and 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18000 machines in U.S. and ABT wants to build for 50,000 tests every day. In Taiwan, an investigation is being developed, which is mainly connected with non-cooperative proteins(notic proteins), this hope can result in a rapid examination of these methods in 15 minutes.
A review of a literature of March 2020 concluded that Comperutical importance is low but before the start of symptoms it can be found.
Special features of thirth, Asmitted and later distributed are included in biletal multi-floor ground-Glas Oposs(Experation).
As the disease grows, the effect of subplorphal is developed.
The study that compares the source point of the present epidemic to PCR in VU has suggested that while many features of the KT are similar to other symptoms of pneumonia and disease, it is more remarkable than PCR.
Till March 2020, American College of Radiopolitanji agrees that the COVID -LRB-19 -RRB- should not be used as test test or first line test. By March 2020, the CDC primary tests are recommended.
Part of resistance to infection includes production of users including IGM and IG.
After the commencement of symptoms 7 days or around it, these can be used to determine the resistance of people and detect infection for people. Tests can be checked through Central labs(CLT) or▁ध्यान Officers test.
In many nebranary labs, auto-poweral systems will be able to do these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT a single sample of blood is usually used, although specimens can be used to see resistance response.
For POCT a single sample of blood is usually obtained from skin mask.
The first step to exit from the PCR laws is not required. On 26th March, 2020 FDA named 29 units which provide information to the agency when necessary and thus enable them to distribute their own investigations.
Up to 7 April 2020, there was only one investigation adopted by FDA. In the end of March 2020 at the end of March 2020, Mohammedan Medical▁मौजूदerry, Diagrex and EPS Diapipes got the acceptance of Europe for their checks which can be traced to viruses, which can be found by IGG and IGAA agents.
Within hours there is power to investigate hundreds of specimens and hence this is quite faster than the traditional PCR test of Vairal RNA.
It can usually be traced to 14 days after the commencement of infection. In April, UK found that none of the doctors bought by him was sufficient to use it.
Hong Kong made plans to stay at home in which suspect patients can live.The Department of Emergency will give specimens to patients, they will spit and get results in some time. British NHS announced that they are planning to check at the house of suspect cases, which eliminates the risk of infection from others if they are treated as hospital or clinics used to do away with the risk of infection. In 1970, the Department of Health Examination will take care of health tests.
Drive-General Centres have helped to test out the fastest, most extensive investigation from any country in South Korea. In Germany, National Association of Health, Philippines, Taiwan said that there was a capacity to check around 12,000 per day in Mulcipal setting and last week 10,700.
When test is ordered by doctor, costs are taken by health insurance.
According to the Speaker of Robert Coach Institute, Germany's total capacity of 1000 is per week.
Up to 19 March, drive-to-thru was done in many big cities.
By 26th March 2020, the total number of investigations in Germany was not known, because there was only smile results.
Earlier in the lab survey it was seen that till week 12/20, including 12/20, at least 483,295 specimens were examined and 339% specimens were born for SARS-91. In Israel, researchers of Technian and Rambum Hospital had added specimens to specimens and if there is a combination of fifty-four specimens, they were able to examine the specimens from around 64 specimens and tested their specimens by examining them. In addition to Rs 64, there were some of them, and there were some of them. In 1844444444444, which was discovered.
Taking care of the construction by BGI founder Vang Zaan and taking five days, the model has seen that if it doesn't start testing capacity, there are 47% cases greater than 47% and the cost of dealing with Quantin is doubled.
Jain Labourkari's Huo-Nan labs are immediately followed in Shangene, Tirnein, B▁रहतेING and Shanghai in all 12 cities throughout China.
Up to 4th March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was of 50,000 checks every day. From the previous articles, there are many open sources, which use 93 tests, which can be tested to specimens of more than 1122 patients. These balanced specimens can be driven into smaller labs without the need of a striker.
Before March, there were problems in testing high levels of activity and insufficient levels of growth, UK and US.
It inspired some writers to figure out protocol which involves heat of RNA for 5 minutes for further investigation. On March 31 it was declared that the United Arab Amrets were now doing more inspection for their population than for any other country, and reached large levels of population level.
This was due to the addition of drive check capacity and group of Group 42 and BGI(based on enquiry, based on enquiry labs(based on enquiry).
In 14 days, the laboratory is able to check thousands of RTPCRs every day, and the first lab working on such a large scale outside China.
Different experiments were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted and sent Germany's law for creating less countries which lack resources.
Germany's law was published on 17th January 2020. The protocol developed by Union States's Centre for Division Control was not available till January 28 which delayed testing in U.S.
On the other hand, experts say that the widespread availability of investigation in South Korea helped to reduce the spread of Nanval Coonenis.
Test capacity, particularly in the labs of private area, was developed by South Korean government during many years.
On 16th March, the World Health Organization said that the best way to slow up the growth of COVID-1919 epidemic. Because of the greater demand that the virus spread on the wide scale, there were thousands of per capita checks in the labs and the supply of fahs and chemical functions became tense.
In March 2020 China pointed out the problems of accuracy in their investigations.
In the United States of America, there was some delay in the research done by CDC. The government again removed the bureaucracy barriers which were preventing personal investigations. Spain purchased out of sugar firm▁शीर्षuclegenian company, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm pointed out that wrong results can be due to failure to collect specimens or use insects properly.
The Spanish ministry said that he would remove the wrong probes and he would change the other investigations produced by Shangen Gazi. The Czech Republic bought 80% investigations from China.The Cricket purchased wrong results from China and bought 1.2 million vaccines which were not found accurate.
Prime Minister Ma▁बस▁बसhas suggested that he should put them in Danjab. Ate Kab of Turkey's health ministry said that Turkey bought from China the highest error rate. He did not use the term which bought 3.5 Tests from China at the beginning of April 2020, declared that he was not capable of using them.
After investigations, people whose investigations have been tested were able to find out what was happening to them from around SARS-EV-2 people who came in contact.
In Italy, instead of the first COVID-19, researchers working in Vambay town of Italy conducted over 3,400 people over the entire population at about ten days.
There were no signs among half of the persons who were infected with lung cancer, and people who were all tested were treated.
New infections were completely eliminated due to travel restrictions on coming and going.
Compensation of contact, internal travel restrictions, investigations and constituents, but severe restrictions such as voters and self-officials have been banned, 2020 is very slow enough than in Singapore other developed countries.
Many programmes have been cancelled, and Singapore started asking the residents to stay home from 28 March, but after graduation on 23th March.
Many other countries, such as Zimbabwe and South Korea, have also been able to detect sexually, by removing internal travel, and by checking and consolidating, but by less aggressive lockdown, the epidemic has been protected.
Statistics show that in countries where more than the number of deaths has been tested, the deaths rate of cases is very low, perhaps because these countries are only capable of detecting those who are light or without symptoms.
WHO argues that those countries which have no capacity to investigate and which have limited experience of national labs on COVID-19, send one of their first five genotypes and 10 per cent examples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 references of WHO.
16 contexts are in 7 Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, Simbi in articles % The column is affected by the research policy of the country.
As other things happen, a country where only those who have been admitted to hospital will be more than a country where all citizens are tested, even if they show signs.
Hand washing(or handing), which is also known as washing of hands, is done to remove dust, oil, sulphur or other organic substances from their hands.
During one day, for instance, for washing hands regularly with soap is preventable. For example, diarrhea, which flow from the toilet way.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as respiratory diseases, skin nose or mouth ; they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
During the day five important moments where washing with soap is important, these are: before and after toilet, after cleaning or washing the baby 's teeth, before feeding and preparing food before feeding or preparing raw meat, fish or chicken, before feeding.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization prescribes washing of hands at the following times:
before preparing food, during and after.
before and after taking care of the sick person.
after cleaning the baby who uses diper or toilet.
after▁मानाing your noses and▁मानेings.
after touching animals, fodder, animals.
The health of the medical hand, hygiene of the medical processes referes to customs relating to medical processes.
Before providing medicine or medical care, hand can prevent or reduce the spread of washing disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean chemicals with hands which can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who manage food or work in medical sector, but it is also an important action for ordinary people.
Hand washing benefits a lot of health benefits ; reducing the spread of influencies, coronas and other infectious diseases; prevention of contagious causes ; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing birth rate in cases of childbirth at home.
It turns out from a 1996 study that babies under five years of age can improve their length by good washing habits.
In developing countries, simple behavioural changes like washing hands with soap can reduce child mortality rate related to respiratory diseases.
This simple task can reduce death rate from these diseases to 50%.
The measures that promote washing can reduce traffic cases to about one third, and it is similar to providing clean water in low income areas.
In traffic cases 48% can be connected to washing hands with soap. In homes, schools and communities all over the world there is the only effective and cheap way to prevent infection.
A leadingरARI, polio is the main cause of death among children under five years of age with an estimated 18 million children per year.
due to diarrhea and pneumonia, about 35 million children die annually.
According to University, before eating and using toilets, after making it a strong habit to wash hands with soap can save life more than a vaccine or medical approach, which can reduce the number of deaths caused by diarrhea by nearly half and deep respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally linked with water, sanitation and other cleaning measures as part of the programme.
Hand washing is also protected from▁नबीtro, which spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of washing hands is that frequent washing of hands can damage skin due to drying of skin.
In 2012, a digital study found that excessive washing of hands can create a condition of lemoned skin, which is known as diagnchitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Very often it is seen as one of the symptoms of heart disease(OCD).
During the day there are five important times when washing hands with soap is important: using toilet, washing, washing after cleaning children's teeth(after cleaning), feeding before feeding, preparing food, preparing meat, cooking meat, fish, etc.
There are other occasions when the proper technique of washing of hands should be used for preventing infection ; before or after treatment of injury; after coughing, coughing or sniffing; after touching animals or animals after handling ; and after touching waste.
In many countries, soap washing is low.
A study of washing hands in 54 countries was found that an average of 38.7% families accepted washing with soap. One 2007 study showed that there was 97 per cent highest rate in Saudi Arabia ; with 77% in America this rate was medium; and with 23 per cent in China this rate was the lowest rate. Now many changes are now available in the practice of washing hands with soap. In order to wash their hands on important times, children have to wash their hands. On certain days, children have to wash their hands on a regular basis, it is possible to have a common development in children's hands.
The education department was implemented in Philippines by the Department of Health Care programme is an example of action in order to promote children's health and education.
This national program includes washing your hands with soap, washing your hands twice a year.
It has been implemented successfully in Indonesia.
In water it can be done better to extract microstructure from skin, including soap or determinant.
In the main process of soap and determination, there is reducing barriers, and increasing sensitivity.
Once alone water is developed, because fat and proteins, which are components of carbon dioxide, do n't enter the water easily.
However, adequate flow of water gets help in cleaning.
Due to frequent use, solid soaps can remain infected from previous uses.
Some studies that see the transfer of bacteria through polluted soap have concluded that bacteria are not likely to be washed along with salt.
However, according to CDC, there are better soaps which can be used without touching hands without touching hands.
Health care for the people has been preached by stressing bacteria-free soaps.
Till today, there is no evidence that the use of appropriate anthropologists or germs in nature produces anti-visitic organisms.
However, in bacteria soaps there are common bacteria like triklobins, in which there is a comprehensive list of resistance species of organisms.
Therefore, even though bacteria do n't produce anti-biotic resistance species from soaps, they cannot be as effective as they are to be effective.
Apart from an agent protecting ozone and skin , acidic acid(sitic acid), acid acidic acid, acidic acid(like acidic acid), acidic acid and other skinic acid can be acidic. University and University of McManal, University of Public Health have shown that there is a wide analysis of the diseases of the public health that can be prevented from brushing away from▁जलlumination and fertilising acids. As many as fertilisic acids can be effective in acid acid acid acid acid acid acid acid acids.
Easy hot water is not enough to kill bacteria.
The temperature of the body (37 degrees C) increases very rapidly.
However, for removing natural oils with soil and bacteria, hot water is more effective than cold, soap water.
However, unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water doesn't have any effect on reducing glucose levels on hands.
One is Santritar or handguard without water-free water-free washing agent(
During the early decade of 1990s and the early 19th century, there is no washing water-free washing agent(which is also known as Alco-based Lords(also known as Persons, Peoples, Jastors or Henditor) began to achieve popularity.
Most of them are based on alcohol, alcohol or alcohol, which is used for easy purposes and to reduce the effects of extinction of Alcoor in a jail like kabirmer(a multiple acids of acid), or sulphur like a liquid or flosine.
Hydrogen-operation increases fluctuations. 60 to 95% Alco's hearingrs are efficient germs.
Alcographer, Sanskritrit, multi-odav resistance (MSA and VRE), tuberculosis(HIV, Harmpus(HIV, Rishnchis, Jainchis, vaccines, Influs and hepatitis) and tuberculosis.
After about 30 seconds of setting out, 99.97% spoil bacteria(3.5,5,3,3,3, 3, 3, 3, 3D, 35 per cent reduction), and 1st minute after putting down, 99% of 99.999% of bacteria(from 4) is more effective. Santritor is the most effective and some of the viruses are less effective.
Alco-based Sanskrit-based Sanskrit, Mobile(or Norpox), which is the most common cause of infectious▁सहायताritrit showath, is almost entirely unorganised. Both hands should be used for whole or cover.
In front of both hands and in between and between, and all fingers are washed up till about 30 seconds until liquids, foams or jails are dried up.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed properly in both palms. American disease control and prevention center offers to wash hands instead of sanitriators, especially when the hand appears dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on ease and swift action towards microvis ; although they should not be used as substituted for proper washing of hands until soap and water are not available.
Alco-based cells can be used repeatedly by dry skin unless the skin is attached to the skin
Galisin and/or other fans can be reduced or abolished by reducing the effects of extinction.
In clinical tests , aeroplanes-based cellular cellularized with soap or fluctuators was considerably reduced to skin envy and dryness compared to soap or fluorides.
There are rare cases of disease caused by diabetics, contact with▁शब्दcentia syndrome or high blood pressure towards those present in Alkota or Alikoss.
With soap and water, the lower tendency to stimulate fearlessness became a attraction to washing hands with soap and water.
In spite of their effectability, without water scientists do not clean carbon material with hands, but they just avoid germs.
That's why it's not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of diseases because diseases are still on hand.
Alkota-free is very dependent on the efficiency materials and formulas of Sanskrit, and historically their performance has been much lower than Alikosha and Alikothi Lords.
Recently , unlike Alkota, which is probably shown to reduce efficiency after frequent use due to progressive adverse skin reactions, after use of▁बिलकुलjanicium chloorides is shown to be continuous and stored fluctuating after using fluctuations.
Many people in low income communities can't buy soap and instead use ash or soil instead.
Sosh or soil can be more effective than water alone, but it can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are polluted with microstructure, it can increase the spread of disease instead of reducing the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is also a toilet agent because in water contact it makes an alkali factory.
WHO has not been able to supply soap, as alternative to soap, has been used as sand or sand(((
The following steps include proper washing of hands provided by the US disease control and prevention Centre for prevention of disease are involved:
wet hands with hot or cold water.
Fluctuations of running water because stable water can be polluted, whereas water temperature doesn't matter.
Cut the proper amount of soap on your hands along the back part of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
soap removes germs from skin, and studies show that people wash their hands thoroughly when they use soap alone instead of water.
at least for 20 seconds.
rubing generates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and for a long time get more germs.
wash properly under running water.
washing hands again can be polluted by washing your hands again.
to dry up in droughts or air with a clean mouth.
wet hands are more easily polluted. Most of the places which are most free are thumbs, thumbs, arti, keys and under nails.
Artificial nails and▁शक़iculates can provide shelter to textiles.
In order to protect hands from drying, the mother condition is often recommended ; dry skin can damage skin, which can increase risk of infection.
In developing countries where there is no water and/or soap available, when necessary, there can be various low costable options to make washing easy, for example, to draw water from a drop-pitha or ash or ash which is suitable for washing. In normal water supply(like university or rural area), water supply, etc. In developing countries, water is available, for example there are low cost cost and other options.
Tata-Pop is a simple technique in which water is used by the rope to throw in some quantity of water on hands, hands and soap.
It is an essential part of the cleaning process of hands effectively but there is some controversy about drying in public toilets.
Research done in large quantities shows that the electric power which is found in many toilets gives paper toil more sanitation than those found in toilets.
In 2008, there was a study conducted by University of West Egypt, London, which was sponsored by the European Telemonium, whose aim was to compare the level of sanitation supply through paper, technology, textile, hot-winders and high-scale jets.
Due to washing hands and drying of hot air, the average population of bacteria increased by 194% and 254% on palms.
With jet-epire drying the total population of bacteria increased by 42% and 15% on palms.
After washing hands and drying the paper from Towell, the average population of bacteria declined from 76% to 77% on teeth and palms. Scientists also tried to establish whether each type of drying method was capable of other users and toilet systems.
jet-pire, which generates air from the unit with 180 m/m/w(650m/4m), hands and units, hands and unit to blow minute organisms and perhaps other toilets were capable of spoiling the environment.
using hot air-water fibres, the drawer rose from the drawer to 0.025 meters.
Paper Toil did not show any significant spread of microstructure. In 2005, in a study done by T.V. Procedure Omwell, different modes of drying were appreciated.
The following changes were seen after drying hands:
There are many different panels, and they are compared with paper to Toil.
In the absence of soap and water during the journey there is an alternative for washing hand.
Alco-based cells should be at least 60% algorithmial.
A long time after the discovery of the disease in the hospital by the Spanish physician Jasperis, it became necessary to wash their hands.
There are electronic devices which provide feedback to remind the hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
In one study, there has been reduction in infection rate due to their use.
Medically the hands are washed for the minimum 15 seconds, in which soap and water are used for proper quantities of jail and each part of the hands is rubed.
Both hands have to bite and rub each other.
If there are wastes below nails, then a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water, it's important to wash properly and wipe with a clean mouth.
After dryness, papers to shut down should be used(and if necessary), any exit door should be opened)
This protects us from being polluted again from those surfaces.
In the health care system, the purpose of washing hands is to remove diseases and prevent them being transmitted.
According to the report of the New England Journal of Medicine, most medical environments do not have to wash their hands regularly before touching a doctor and nurse patients.
One study shows that proper washing of hands and other simple processes can reduce blood infection rate by 66 per cent. World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing standard hands and handguards.
The guidance of washing hands available by this organisation can also be found on its website for public comments.
A relevant review was made by Vibi and others.
If the performance of legislature is necessary then commercial equipment can measure and prove the temperature of hands.
The World Health Organization has laid down five opportunities to wash their hands:
after contacting blood/body fluids
before germs, and before work,
after the care of the patient. In soap or Subiquitous soap, germs can be added by hand washing agents.
Before surgery or in a system where anti-biotic resistance organisms are very widespread, it may be expected to use such a potential. To cut your hands off and close your hands without touching them, some washing or washing hands after washing, some washing or washing after drying hands, without brushing, and without brushing, and without brushing, and without brushing, and without brushing, and without brushing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This process usually requires washing for 2-6 minutes by hand and jaw till 2-6 minutes.
There is no time to rub for 10 minutes.
At washing time, water should be prevented from coming back to their hands.
After the completion of the washing of hands, the hands are adorned with a liquid cloth and they are worn by a blood donor.
To reduce the spread of germs, before and after the care of someone who is ill, it is better to use hand washing or hand washing.
In hospitals, for control of Staffolkol infection, it has been found that from 20% of the biggest benefit had come from washing hands, and when the cleaning of hand increased from 35%, there was very little advantage.
By washing hands with simple soap, bacteria are more likely to be infected than infected with infected soap. It is compared to washing your hands with्््ततततत्््््््््््््््््््््््््््ब््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््््रररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररररर
But through the hands H1N,A virus and chlorine chromosomes are more effective than soap and water-based plants. In health care systems, education is done on hand, education, development of Lord's Allowance, writing and oral reminder can include employees.
There is more research on how many of these measures are effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap, good health, and even good nutrition are considered necessary tools.
However, it is a challenge to get global washing practice due to lack of water supply, soap or washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplace.
For example, in most rural Africa, there are very few washing channels near each private or public toilet, even if there are cheap options for building headquarters.
However, rather than being less washing rates, soap or water shortage, there can also be due to the habits laid down.
The encouragement and support of washing hands with soap can affect policyal decisions, increase awareness about the benefits of washing and change the duration of population behavior.
To do this effectively, surveillance and evaluation are essential.
A study of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective in washing hands in LMCs, whereas social publicity campaign is less effective. In schools, one example for washing hands is three stars, which encourage schools to take simple steps to ensure that along with other cleaning requirements, students wash their hands with soap.
When minimum standards are attained, schools can go from one to three stars.
The building station can be part of the campaign for washing hands, which is done to reduce disease and child mortality rate.
There is another example of the global washing day, the awareness campaign, which aims to change behaviour. Because of the 2019-20 virus epidemic, Jaimool encouraged to wash one's hands.
Some studies have considered the overall cost of washing hands in developing countries with regard to defence from diagnels.
However, one review shows that encouraging hand washing with soap is far more effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of washing your hands for human health - especially those who have given birth to children or injured soldiers in hospitals - for the first time in the middle of the 19th century hands were identified by two doctors who worked in Indonesia, Austria and Florence English, which is the founder of nursing.
At that time most people believed that infection was due to smell called msmusmus.
During the 1980s, food poisoning and health infections inspired American disease control and prevention centre as important methods to prevent infection.
In 2009 the rage of health flu and COVID(1920) epidemic increased awareness about the importance of washing of hands with soap to protect itself from infectious diseases.
For example, posters with proper washing techniques were hanged in Germany in public toilets and offices, offices, and airport toilets.
The phrase wash your hands means you must declare your indifference to take responsibility for what you have done or to accept it.
This came from Matthew chapter where Paninius Pilet separated himself from the decision of offering Jesus Christ on the cross, but it became a string of extensive use in some English communities.
In Krishna's Macbeth, Lady McBirth began to wash his hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which shows beyond his offences committed by him and inspired his husband to commit offence.
It is also found that people wash their hands more often than others after they remember or think about immoral things, and give more importance to hand washing equipment.
Besides, people who have been allowed to wash their hands after this manner of thinking are less likely to join the service themselves.
Religion recommends washing hands with water for both purposes. To wash hands with water without washing hands, to wash their hands with soap, to wash their hands, to wash their hands, to wash their hands, to wash their hands, to wash their hands, and to wash their hands.
After using the toilet in Hindu religion, Judaism and Islam, washing of hands is mandatory.
And, Hindu religion, Buddhism, Sikh religion, Judaism and Islam have to wash their hands before and after every meal.
Control of the dangers of developing COVID-1919 infection on the workplace
Control of risk spread on the workplace at COVID-1919(COVID-191) for control of dangers are business protection and health services.
Depending on the risk risk of the spread of disease on the workplace, of the workplace and the work being done, which is based on the risk of exposure to sources of communication, awareness of disease in the community and risk factors of personal action which are more risk of infection.
According to American business security and health administration, there is a minimum business connection between people and other colleagues in less interactions, for which basic infection measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay in home if they are ill, to follow care for health manners, and to clean the environment regularly.
middle contact costs are those for which there is the need for frequent communication with people who do not know or are suspicious of COVID-19, but who are infected due to active community opposition or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the common people like schools, high population work environment, some high-scale sales systems.
Apart from basic prevention measures, this group is involved in the control measures of danger: using air pollution, using air filter, and maintaining personal security equipment for that position if there is to be faced with COVID-199 infected person.
▁शांति OSHA believes those health workers and dead house workers are likely to fall in high contact which comes into contact with COVID-1945 or suspected person, and this risk becomes higher contact if the worker works on COVID-1919 or is infected with air pollution processes, or they collect specimens or collect specimens from them.
In control of appropriate dangers for these workers, there are negative pressure control tools like the negative pressure cells and suitable personal security equipment for the work.
within the workplace there may be many effects of COVID-19% anger.
Sickness, self care for others or fear of possible contact can be prevented from working.
Which goods are required, and the means to get these goods(like through low demand or delivery or by transport services) can change the type of business.
At the end of the COVID-19 may be affected by the presence of objects from geographical areas. The use of preparation and response for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective functions.
Scheme refers to the risks associated with various workplace and jobs, including risks caused by sources of risk, housing and community organisations, and risk factors such as aging or old medical conditions.
They also underline the forces necessary to address the risks that may result from anger.
Preparation and reaction plans for infectious diseases can be subject to national or international agencies.
One is involved in reaction to anger: reducing the disinvestment between employees, safeguarding high health complications, maintaining business operations and reducing the adverse effects on other units in their supply chain.
It affects the reaction of diabetics in the community where they are in place of business.
The sequence of risk control is a structure which is used in commercial safety and health, according to technology, to set limits of risks.
Where COVID-19 dangers cannot be abolished, there are the most effective control control, after which there are administrative control and personal security equipment.
Information controls allow employees to separate without depending on the dangers related to work, and it can be the most constructive solution to implement.
Legislature control is change in policy or processes for which action is required by workers or employers.
Personal security equipment is considered to be less effective than administrative and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
People should be selected according to danger, properly dressed(like, breathing(like, breathing), etc. ; regular inspection, maintenance, etc. to be changed according to requirements, to be removed and cleaned and to be stored or to avoid contamination.
According to American business security and health administration, there is a minimum business contact with people and other colleagues in less interactions.
All workers are involved in prevention of basic infection ; repeatedly and effectively wash your hands, encourage workers to stay in home if they are sick, sniffing, sniffing, sniffing and waste content ; if necessary, prepare long-term or refrigeration tools and equipment for other workers, to use them effectively, and to use them regularly, to clean environments and to avoid germs.
It is an important step towards the safety of persons who are likely to be infected by infectious diseases, consumers, visitors and other people.
The American Disease Control and Prevention Center recommends that staff with severe body disease should remain at home until they are less than 24 hours without fluctuations, fevers, etc. without any symptoms, or any other symptoms ; and that disease policies, which allow patients to take care of members of the family who are ill, are aware of these staff members and are aware of their policies.
According to OSHA, middle connection costs include things that require frequent or close connection with people with six feet (1.8 meter) whose members do not know whether or are not infected, but because of community movement around the business place, they can be infected from SARS-V-2, because the person has recently moved to international destination.
These are the workings which are connected with ordinary people, like schools, high population work environment, and some high-scale sales systems. To set up high-level air pollution controls for this and higher risk organisations, to create high air pollution, to set up air pollution devices like transparent plastic guard, to set up services like transport services, and to encourage services. In this group, there are high rates of transport services, access to emergency services, access to emergency services, to provide services, to provide access to emergency services, to provide access services, to provide services, to provide services services, to provide access services, to emergency services, to emergency services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services, to provide services.
In this group the workers are rarely required to use breathing.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, then there are proper controls for the safety of workers and other passengers: to remove the sick person from 6 feet, to call a member of the crew to serve someone who is ill, and to call on the sick person with a smile of face or nose and mouth.
When touching sick passenger or body liquid matter or potentially polluted surfaces, the crew should wear special medical gloves, and if the sick passenger finds it difficult to breathe fever, cough or breathing, then perhaps additional safety equipment should be put on.
Cricket and other special items should be handled in a biodependent bag, and polluted surfaces should be cleaned up later. For commercial nine programmes including ships and other passenger ships, in control of dangers, travelling in the direction of transportation and immediately informed medical center if on board, there are other symptoms or symptoms.
ideally, medicine should be followed in the room of a separate person. For schools and baby care, CDC is short to clean up or prevent germs. If an infected person is in an independent school building.
When there is a middle group movement from minimum time to time, the strategy for building social distance can be applied, such as field rounds, meetings and other large gatherings such as removing food in physical education or singing classes, raising distance between the desks, separating time from the desks, restricting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health room for children like fluatunctuation, etc.
When the local community is quite disciplinary, it can be considered for extended school holidays apart from the strategy of making social distance. Law on daily law activities, immediately health risk is considered as lower by CDC.
Procedure Officer who has been confirmed by COVID-19 or has to contact suspicious persons, he is permitted to follow directions similar to emergency medical guidance along with appropriate personal security equipment.
If there is close contact during arrest, the workers should adhere to standard procedures for washing of their duty belts and equipment before reuse of home cleaning or▁बिनाuging.
OSHA considers some health care and funeral services to be higher or higher in degrees of risk.
High contact matters include providing health care, aid, lab and medical transport, which comes into contact with known or suspect patients of COVID-19.
They become very high contact riskors if workers collect and manage the processes which are known by COVID-19 or create Airerosol on suspected patients.
In the process which generates Airerosol, tubes, specimens are included in the entry process, textile process, broadness, some dental procedures and tests, etc.
During his death of COVID-19 people, who are known or suspected cases, during his death, these become very high contactable. In addition to these risk groups, there are other dangers, including air pollution, air pollution processes, etc.
Some health care and a specific negative pressure can be appropriate.
specimens should be handled with bio safety levels with 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are present, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 cases, should be separated into different waiting areas. Other than PE, the OSHA prescribes breathing cells for persons who are known by SARS-192 or within 6 feet of patients, which create air pollution and activity.
In America, NIOH approved by N95 filtering fumes or better than it should be used in terms of extensive, written Siva security programme, which includes proper surveillance, training and medical examination.
Other types of breathing cells can provide more safety and improve the rest of the function. WHO doesn't recommend solvents because COVID-1919 is a respiratory disease, rather than transmitted through physical fluids.
WHO provides for screening works at entrance.
For people who are collecting specimens of COVID-199 patients, taking care of or transport from non-official processes, WHO provides a▁मदद▁मदद▁मदद▁मददological mask, gillary faces, Choong and gloves.
If there is a process which generates Airerosol, it is converted from N95 or FFFF2 breath.
Viewing that the global supply of PE is inadequate, allowing people who are in direct care to enter into a room with a COVID-1960 patient only necessary to use PEP for specific purposes ; without removal of the same medical care of many patients without removal of the same donor, using the supply chain, inspections and inspections to reduce the use of users.

There are extraordinary circumstances around us this month.
COVID-19▁चर्चा has made clear our obligations to all humanity and to each other.
But we do know that our best reaction depends on global empathy, cooperation and community growth which is at the centre of this organisation.
On email, calls and chat, the kind of thing we've seen between all our colleagues is remarkablely proof that we've found it worth working with so many extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud that I can't tell you in words.
Last week one person praised our work with me.
He reminded me of how meaningful it is at this time to turn to Wikipedia, and how powerful it is to be available for this most important resource online and for everyone.
Your job makes it possible, whether you keep the site on or you are the source of our workers or our communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it's most needed.
This is a moment in which our way of working and doing it will both make a significant impact on the world.
Because of this mission, and because of the importance of your role, we're going to make significant changes in our way of working with us since this week.
changes in our activities and times
As Kuwait said earlier, C-Tham met the past night to discuss our system and prepare our days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the best way of maintaining the stability of organisation on the situation that we faced in front of us, and during this period we considered.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to remove tensions and support our mission for a long time.
If you want to reduce your work, there's nothing wrong with it.
For all staffs, organisations, organisations, etc.
Our daily work is about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week than next notice.
We're not declaring holiday - if you're able to do more than normal hours, then Mission needs your help.
However, at this moment the world is unexpected, and whether you care for your loved ones, if you want to get goods, or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not keeping track of your time.
If you're ill, don't work.
It doesn't need to say it, but we're saying that.
There is no need for any illness or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team to amend the calendar and time-to ensure that the main area of work is seen by somebody.
(If you have been confirmed by COVID-19, please tell the Bollywood of Twitter, to help you and ensure that you can give appropriate attention to management on your situation)
Hours will get full salary for workers.
We've already said, and we're expressing our commitment to fulfill our commitment to our organisations and staff.
During normal circumstances, everyone gets paid on the basis of his normal work hours.
Even if you are ill and cannot work, you will get paid.
If you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfactory, especially at such times.
Once again, you must take care of yourself.
We have to say that you should talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can adapt.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we can't stop.
SRE, HRAs, trust and security, security and aid are important things which can be needed with additional cooperation.
We will start a process with all departments to assess existing objectives and to concentrate our attention on the cooperation of vital things for our mission.
We all have plenty to do, we're going to focus on just the most important projects.
We're going to avoid injury later due to slowing down.
after the global epidemic is passed there is no plan to give us double time.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet the realities of reality.
We believe things have changed, and where we're right, we're going to go towards new targets and times.
What happens with APP?
We want to adjust our new reality and daily work hours with expectations, we want to change our 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 201920 Plan by which we have more time to make budgets, so that workers give priority to their most important work, self care, care and care for loved ones, and which need to work on time spent for the next few weeks, or to improve their desire.
This extension of time will reduce our current planning and pressure in the entire organisation.
We will make our resolution next week before the Director, and we will inform representatives and teams about the steps ahead.
Thank you for your leadership.
the status of the office, the connection, and the cleaning
Last week we found out that we've got a SF-based colleague in contact with COVID-19.
However, taking careful care we deployed all the surfaces of the San Francisco Office to consolidate the antivariators.
He tested every floor from hospital-relief, the congress, and the elevator bank coming to our ground.
Using products that protect his people in the building, his own care protocol is being implemented.
We believe that when we come back, the office will be fully ready.
Our DC office is located in a Vegwork which shares with us its COVID-19 protocol and all staff present.
Last week our DC Office was in accordance with our guidance from France.
As we know some of our self-official colleagues, it's also going on talking about taking a seat in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from house to house for the first time.
Our colleagues working from home for long periods of time know that it will require adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit meetings time to more than one or two hours old.
If more sessions are necessary, consider sharing them during several days.
clearly define meetings, keep agencies ready, and send reading material already.
To make the living co-operation easier to make Google Drx and zoom, with the help of tool, make video your default option((
Take initiatives to make each meeting easy, watch a person's chat room for questions, keep track of opportunity lists and help take notes with mutual cooperation(or notes)
If you want comfortable headset, send email to technology support.
Use your health care for shortness.
to talk about the distributed work with your colleagues(S▁कठिन), connect with theremoties Channel.
To cooperate with the growth of the entire distribution team, he is examining without-based labour guidance.
Last week we asked all members of the community to cancel commercial public programmes, such as YouTube, etc. until WHO announced the end of global epidemic.
We told them that we think it would be impossible for us to meet their mutual grants by our request and other restrictions and that no one will be punished for delay or amendment in those targets.
In this week we will follow further guidance with regard to Vikiia and other regional and regional community conferences.
Due to this obstacle, the feeling of sorrow spread in the entire world community, but at the same time they have a sense of relief from their own communities, on Vicimia and otherwise on consideration.
forwarding, controlling influence and providing a place for the community to follow our communication with them.CRT is working to arrange a page on the media.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 issues
We send an invitation to your calendar for a special team meeting next Thursday, 14:0096/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional update, answer your questions, and spend some time connected with each other.
We're together in these circumstances and we're available for help as possible.
Meanwhile, you can continue looking for information from this email on office, and all other necessary COVID-19.
CRT makes these pages unique and puts all information into one place.
We are also working at this time to maintain regular communication with employees living in affected countries.
If you have to ask about travel, programmes, programmes, major work challenge, or you need help in connection with any other thing, please inform the CRT and work with it.
We are available to provide help and create relationships according to requirements.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send email to the director of the HR International International Agency.
None of these changes should be seen as contempt for our work and obligations.
Rather, they recognise that at this time, our activities and obligations are likely to be accepted as we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary for each other's help, so that we can work, contribute our activities along with cooperation of their needs, and continue to serve whatever service the world depends on.
When time comes, our schedule will be waiting for us.
Right now, this time is helping each other, and it is possible to make space for important work coming in the next week and possibly in the next month.
We need all of you to make it possible, and so we want you to take care of all your families so that when you need it you can get to your best level.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face.

Ananthropology(ACE2) is connected to the outer surface of cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and arteries.
ACE2 by reducing the amount of insulin-II and increasing annumonic acid(1-7)(CE) which regulates the activity of ejaculation(CAE), which makes it hope for treatment of heart diseases. A▁किताबC2 also functions as a point of entry into the cells for viruses.
The human version of Azadum is often referred to as ▁थोड़े2.
Ejaotine-econom 2 last week on the surface of the cell and other cells.
ACE2 protein consists of N-tomeral peptids, M2 domains and C-Tinominium▁काफीlumic acids.
ACE2 lungs and other tissues have a permanent end on the surface of cells, i.e. the type of protein which is once crossed with active domains.
ACE2's external organic domain is dissolved by other ananjaids named after Sheidaj, and as a result the chromosome is released into blood flow and finally emitted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most parts: ACE2 types of lungs mainly Type II Aircaxic cells, short▁रहताxies, artery cells and most of the organs are connected with the delicate tissues of the artery cells.
ACE2 MRANA is also found in the appearance of the anthropology, oatomum, Hypoulus and brain column((
ACE2's primary work is to act as the genius of ASE.

ACE2(read-Arg9)-bre▁लियाinin, epilinelin, neuron, insulin, insulin, etc. can also divide many other frames.
ACE2 Disapproximately▁उपलब्ध▁यहsophic acid also controls the emission of SLC6A19 and it plays its role in heart disease.
As an approgen protein, ACE2, HDP63; SARS(SARS which produces viruses); and SARS-VV2, which produces COV-1919, works as the main point of entry for viruses.
More importantly, there is an interconnection between the SARS-EV and SARS-EV2 cell cells on the surface of the cell on the surface of ACE2 cell.
For this entry process there is also the need to stimulate SFR2 by providing nutrients through TPMS2, which is also subject to current investigation. Because of this, some people have established that the cells can help against infection by reducing the levels of ACE2.
However, several professional organisations and neuron bodies have proposed standard ACE blocker and BARB medicine to continue.
Reviews published on July 11th 2012 and meta-blution found that the use of ACE blocker compared with control was linked to 34% in the risk of pneumonia.
At the same time, there was the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with an ASE blockers who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially among victims and heart failure people.
ACE blockators were also used with shortage of deaths related to pneumonia, although the result was less powerful than the normal risk of pneumonia.
Recession Man ACE2(r.A.C.E.) is considered to be a new drug for severe loss of lungs, and transliteration-terrorism-sproduction problems in babies with high blood pressure are also found to be improved.
The half-hour of rHCE2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the beginning of the 24-hour operation is 30 minutes.
Many conclusions point out that there is hope for non-cooperation systems(RSES resistance)for non-official people.
COVID-1960 mobile software organisation, which is connected with the reaction of 2019-20 Korunarus epidemic, i.e. the process of identification of persons who are in contact with an infected person, is designed for help.
In some fields and judiciary areas, with official government assistance, several organisations were developed or proposed.
Many specimens have been developed for creating contactपरplification.
The concerns of secrecy are raised, especially about systems which are based on track of geographical position of users.
In low-intuitive option, one user has access to other cellphones to log through it.

In South Korea, a non-based system was used to trace contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected information from different sources including mobile devices, tracking data and card exchange data, and they were likely to create notification to infected persons through text messages.
Apart from using this information to warn possible contacts, the government has publicly provided information on matters which are different from MERS after the anger of MERS in that country.
This information is available for the public through several organisations and websites. Many countries, including Germany, considered using the Centreization and Private Protection System.

Coronnis disease 2019(COVID-191) is an infectious disease which causes serious acute respiratory syndrome(SARS-Cooperation)(SV-2).
General symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, pain in pain, cough, throat loss of smell and stomach pain.
Due to coming into contact with virus, the time is normally about five days, but this can happen from two to fourteen days.
However, in most cases symptoms are lighter, in some cases Vairal pneumonia and multiple-long failure develop.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and areas, resulting in more than 13,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are cured. virus is mainly spread among people during intimate contact, often through small drops of cough, cough or sniffing.
Even though these drops are emitted when they drop out, they usually fall on land or surface instead of being infected in a long distance.
People can be infected by touching a dirty surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
virus can survive on surface for 72 hours.
This is the most contagious during the first three days after the beginning of symptoms, but before the symptoms appear and after the disease it may be possible. The standard method of development can be altered from one NASA-time River Reverocarborion Paperion (RTT-PR)(RP)
It is recommended for people who are suspected that they are infected with virus and also for those who care about them.
There are different variations in the use of masks by the common people, some powers allow them not to use them, some explain their use, others make necessary use of them.
Currently, there is no vaccine for COVID(19) or special emergency treatment.
In most countries of all six billion countries, disease has been recorded locally.
People infected with virus can develop flulike symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue and breathing.
To breathe in emergency symptoms, to breathe in pain, pain in chest, confusion, to wake, to be blue to face or lips; when these symptoms are present, they are advised to take immediate medical care.
In less general, the symptoms of upper respiratory path like coughing, nose nose or throat can be seen.
There are different percentage symptoms such as neurogenia, swelling and diarrhea.
In some cases of China, in the beginning, only the chest beat was seen.
In some cases, disease can increase to pneumonia, multiple-long failure and death.
It is called the original period.
For COVID-19, there is usually five to six days, but this can happen from two to fourteen days.
The symptoms develop by 97.5% of the people who develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Information shows that all chromosomes do not develop.
The role of these professional carriers is not yet fully known ; however, the earliest evidences show that they can contribute to the spread of disease.
The ratio of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, about which the Korean disease control and prevention Centre (KCDC) has indicated that 20% of all the registered cases remain unofficial during their stay in hospital.

Although the virus is not usually aired, the National Association of Science has said that bioresol can be able to detect and people's rooms have come out of the air-electricators.
Because of some medical processes like tube entry and heart▁बल्किicic surgery(CPR(CPR), respiratory discharge can become Airerosol and thus air pollution can be spread.
However, there are concerns that it can spread through the urine, but this risk is considered to be less. This virus is the most contagious when people are prone to symptoms, but it is possible to spread before the symptoms arise, but its risk is less.
European disease and control center(ECDC) say that although it is not entirely clear how easy this disease is, one person usually infects two to three persons. It survives from hours to hours.
In particular, viruses were found capable of detecting for three days on one day, plastic,▁आकारlorines(AISI 304) and 99% copper on copper.
However, it's different based on humidity and temperature.
If properly used, soaps and pesticides are also effective; soap products are contaminated with fats of viruses ; they also release them from skin and other surfaces.
Other bugs, such as Benjakalokaium chlorine and chlorines, are less effective. In one of the studies of Hagac▁प्रजाag specimens were taken after two days of getting admitted to hospital.
In six of the six patients, the first specimens showed the maximum number of wires, and the six patients showed the highest level of the test on the second day of test.

Naval SARS-EV-2 viruses all features are found in Koronnis related to nature.
Outside the human body, viruses are destroyed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-V-2 is related to intimacy with the basic SARS-OV.
lungs are more affected than COVID-19(191) because viruses, ejaculation,ulum(CAE2), flow through nutrients, which is the most abundant in air cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and uses a special surface called 'Cooper.
In China hospital admitted 12% of infected people were seriously damaged and this is more common in serious diseases.
During the progress of disease, there are high rates of heart disease symptoms due to diabetic reaction and defence system problems, but rapid medical damage can also be related to ACE2 genotypes in heart.
ACE2 is extremely visible in the heart and is involved in the heart's action.
In the patients involved in COVID-1919 infection(31%), and Vaginas▁जलromomoolism(38), which can be related to ill disease. In the body of people who die from COVID-19, the air pollution damage is found inside the lungs.
Even though SARS-COV-2 is a follower of Shivason's path(CE2-▁तकiculated subsidiary cells), serious COVID-19 patients have symptoms of chromosome.
Specially, the diabetic GMSF-CH-CS T-Charkas were shown closely with the selection of XL-66-covic▁संपर्कes in COVID -LRB-199 patients, selection of XL-6 -RRB- and severe lung disease.
In the circular examination,▁पूर्वphoziesite material has also been mentioned.
WHO has published many tests protocol for this disease.
The standard law of test is▁उपयोगtime River transferment, Pollution, Boxion(rRT-PCCR).
This test is usually done on specimens obtained by a NASAgraphye; however, one nose can also be used as a font or a mouth model.
The results are usually available within two hours from hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for them there are two blood specimens required in the interval of two weeks and the immediate value of the result is reduced.
Chinese scientist were able to distinguish one of the components of koeronis and publish genetic sequence so that the labs around the world can develop free forms to detect infection by viruses.

Less data about COVID-19 are available.
Body tests are the major genetic conclusions obtained:
▁शामिल: Shoth, Pericarditis in flossing of lungs and fertilising and fertilising show.
Vairal can be seen four types of risk of pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: Fichicari show, nucite increase, increase in number, increase in number of new▁सूचनाsites,▁सामर्थ्यicides and fluctuations along with multicursion and multilinking larger cells.
Heavy pneumonia: Wiki along with air leaks(DED) Wiki damage.
DangD has been due to severe respiratory problems, syndrome(ARDS), and serious short-feeding disorder
Treatment of pneumonia: Complicity between air pollutions and fertilising factors.

Till April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical practices are used for primary use rather than for mebromophy.
It has to be taken to reduce the risk of infection, particularly in health care systems, when the tube is produced like antenna or handloom.
COVID-19-for health workers who care about persons ; apart from using CDC standards, contacts and air strikers, the person has to put in an air pollution cell(IIR). During CDC epidemic, he prepares guidelines for use of private security equipment.

When the mask is not available, the CDC offers permission to use the textiles of face or, as a final solution, from home.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so serious that they need mechanical information or other options, but some percentage needs.
COVID-19 The type of Sivason aid for persons who fail is being studied actively for those who are admitted in hospital ; there are some evidences that high flow flow is free from flow of air pressure.
Does one of these two provide the same benefit to sick people in general, doesn't it know?
Some doctors like to use the english technology because this technique limits the spread of airosophic particles compared to higher flow(60 years of age) compared to entry. The case of older adults is the most common among those who are aged more than 80 years of age.
There are not enough hospitals per in many developed countries which limit the capacity of a health system to sustain sudden growth of adequate COVID-19 cases which require hospital recruitment.
There was a study found in China that 5% were admitted to high care units, 2.3% needed mechanical aid, and 1.4% died.
In China, along with COVID-19, nearly 30% were finally admitted to hospital.
Technology is more complex because in COVID-19 there is rapid respiratory crisis which develops and supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
Pressure control systems in control systems and high PSP needs to reduce the loss of lungs and risk of neurons related to neurons.
High PEP cannot be available on old Ventilators.
Research on possible treatment started on January 2020, and many anti-war drugs are in clinical tests.
Reidivor seems to be more promising.
Even though new drugs can develop up to 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested are already approved or are already in progressive experiments.
People with serious illness can try to provide anti-war drugs.
WHO has suggested to the volunteers to take part in the effects of possible treatment and safety tests. FDA has given temporary access to health health technology in such cases where the life of a person is serious or immediate threat.
There are no studies necessary to show that this is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China started a mobile app to deal with this disease.
Users are asked to write their name and ID number.
This is capable of detecting possible risk of infection by using an electronic surveillance data.
Each user can also see the position of three other users.
If possible risk is detected, the umpire does not only follow self-convention, but it also warn local health officers. The cell data, facialisation of facilitators, cell phones, mobile phones, map and artificial intelligence use is used for large data analysis of people who are infected and people who have been contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government enabled security agencies to track people's mobile phone data.
This method was designed to implement Quantin and protect people coming into contact with infected citizens.
Also, in March 2020, Dryche Telcom shared joint phone data with the German Union Government agency for preventing the spread of virus and research.
Russia decided to identify facilitators of Quantin.
Italian regional health, juleo▁बल्किra said he has been informed by mobile phone providers that 40% of people are calling in any way

BBC said to Rory O'Kar:The growing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress and a economic depression is an ideal storm to damage mental health and health.
The other general upper level path of this disease can be diagnosed with some symptoms or without any other symptoms.
Light cases generally recover within two weeks, whereas serious or acute cases can take three to six weeks to correct.
On the basis of data from other similar viruses like▁आधारARS and MSS, pregnant women can risk serious infection with COVID-19, but statistics for COVID-19 are lost. Some people, by affecting COVID-19, can cause pneumonia.
among the most seriously affected people, COVID-19, intense respiratory crisis syndrome(AARDS) can develop rapidly, which can lead to failure, failure, failure of character, frequency or majority failure.
The complications related to COVID-19 include the loss of fertilisation, unusual sanction and heart, kidneys and liver.
Skandan's unusualities, particularly the increase in consumer time, indicated in 6% of those who have been admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while in this group there is unusual action.
About 20-30% infected from COVID-19 are exhibited by the Yazanimese.
According to this information, the average time between the beginning and the beginning of symptoms was ten days in which five days were admitted to hospital.
However, there was an average of seven days between getting admitted to hospital and dying.
In a study of initial cases, from displaying initial symptoms to death, the average time for death was 14 days in which there was a whole limit of six to 41 days.
In a study of China's National Health Commission(NHC), men had 2.8% deaths while women had 1.7% deaths.
Diagnosis tests of tissues of lungs are indicated in both lungs with organic oxides that are emitted by flucractic damage.
In New▁लेंtes cells that occur from Vairal were seen.
The photograph of lungs appeared like severe respiratory crisis syndrome(AARDS).
In 11.8% deaths referred to by the National Health Commission of China, the damage of heart was noted by the High Level of Tropon.
According to U.S. statistics in March, 89% of people who were admitted to hospital had pre-constitution positions. Medical resources are available and social conditions of one area can affect the rate of death.
Death rate is estimated to be different due to those regional differences and system related difficulties.
due to short calculation of light cases, death rate can be increased.
However, the fact that there are cases of death in the past may mean that the current death rate has declined.
As compared to smoking people are likely to have serious symptoms of COVID-19, they are 1.4 times more likely to need deep care or the possibility of death is 2.4 times greater. This disease has been described.
In some people who recover from lung disease, Hugh hospital authority lost between 20% to 30%, and lungs scans damage.
This is due to severe care after recovery.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infection gives effective defence to people who recover from disease.
Other co-operators are seen as possible on the basis of behaviour, but after COVID-19, cases for treatment are indicated in the date of COVID -LRB-19 -RRB-.
These cases are considered to be worse than recurrent infection.
The virus is considered to be the origin of an animal which spreads from natural and animal to human disease.
Real origin is unknown, but the spread of infection till December 2019 was almost entirely done by human-humanist.
In a study of about 41 cases of COVID-19 of the first 41 cases published in January 2020, the earliest date of the beginning of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
According to WHO's official publications first began on 8th December 2019.
There are many methods used for determining death rate.
These numbers vary according to sectors and time ; the quality of health care system, the options of treatment, the past and the features of the population such as age, gender and overall health are affected.
Towards the end of 2019, WHO has fixed emergency ICD-10 disease code for deaths which are confirmed by the lab and has confirmed by the lab SARS-VV-2, i.K.C.C.P.R.C.R.(1972) for the deaths which are diagnosed by AIDS, U.07-07.2). The duration of deaths has shown the number of deaths within a fixed period of time.
Based on data from John Balis University, by 17 April 2020, there are 6.9% ratio(153,2222,240,191)
The number is different according to the area. Other measures include death rate(CFR), which represents the percentage of people who died of a disease, and which represents the mortality rate(▁गुलामR) which is the percentage of infected persons who died from a disease.
These statistics are not time spent and from infection to recovery they follow a specific population.
Although not all infected people grow up, from the presence of the council, there can be information about how many people have been infected.
At the centre of rage in Italy, Kaistillen D'Ada, 4600 people in a small village of 4600 people, 80.7% are already dead.
In Gangata, this disease was spread by Carneginal festivals and young people, so that relatively death rate was reduced, and all COVID-19 deaths could not have been officially classified.
Apart from this, German health system is not absolute.
In the Netherlands, according to examining blood donors, there are about 3% doctors.
COVID-199 to 69(04% population) has been confirmed.
The effects of epidemic and death are different for men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy there are more deaths rate among men.
The most risk for men is that of 50 years of age and between men and women is less than 90 years of age.
In China, for men death rate was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
This penis does not know the exact causes of sex, but there can be one reason.
In sex-based defences, women have less exposure to smoking and in men developing co-operation positions like women can contribute to high blood pressure rate in men compared to women's younger age.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were men and 72% of those who died since COVID-19 were men.
Till April 2020, the US Government is not keeping track of statistics relating to COVID infection.
Research shows that such diseases as meaga, HIV, Influenza and SARS affect both men and women in different ways.
There is a high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, women, and they are more likely to come in contact with viruses.
The World Health Organization announced on 11th February 2020 that the official name of this disease would be 'COVID-19
WHO's Chief Tendrome Indome Gabres told that CO means Corona, VI meaning virus, DNA, and 19 mean that when the year was first identified, it was 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid specific geographical location(like China(like China), species of animals or groups of people, which are similar to international organisations to prevent contempt.

SARS-EV is being used as SARS-EV and SARS-EV-2 for entry into human cells.
Three vaccine strategys are being investigated.
Firstly, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine.
This type of virus, whether disabled or dead, means a new infection towards COVID-19 to produce a quick defence response to the human body.
Another strategy, subsidiary vaccines, target is to make an vaccine which makes the immune system sensitive for some part of the virus.
In SARS-EV-2, this kind of research is focused on the S-Tenter protein which helps prevent viruses from entering ACE2 AJM.
A third strategy is a new technique for making vaccine(▁चुनावAA or RNA vaccine).
Any of these strategy has to be tested for safety and efficiency. On 16th March 2020, a vaccine with four volunteers was started.
The virus which causes disease in the vaccine is a harmful genetic code. Anti-Bombid dependence has been described as a possible challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinic tests are being conducted till April 2020.
Seven Tests were already considering acceptable treatment for malaria, including four studies on Hyxexney or champon.
