Parliamentarians Worried They're Going to 'Look Like Fools'
e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament) is a proposal to change their title from AMe to MWPe.
This was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
members from across the political spectrum are afraid that this could provoke a mockery.
One Labour member says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A Plaid Cymru party assembly member says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.

In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said:The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly Members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
n June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which received broad support to call the meeting n Welsh Parliament.
e title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a public consultation.
e appears to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus may be a headache for the chair, Elin Jones, who must present a bill on the changes within weeks.


Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.


St. Martin's bells are going down because Harlem churches are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
"Today neither is there anymore".
He says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways these days", he says.
"Pubs are no longer neighborhood family rooms where people go on a regular basis".
As for churches, he worries that the money from asset sales won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back to exactly where they started".
"Today, I am not alone in my life", he says. "I am not alone in my life".
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white", he says, "and will therefore bring the day when these churches close down completely even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were making plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".

The expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's has not replaced him.
What has been happening at St Martins for the past few months
The church council, the congregation's governing body, which consists of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese was trying to pass the costs onto the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency from the diocese side.
13-year-old injured shark on lobster dive in California

The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rode with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just the thrill of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!'
"Hammel saw him as he came out.
There is a shark in the water!" adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his torso.

Giles notes that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are struggling with department store-type beauty aisles staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods decline, the larger beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is taking place as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its beauty product portfolio to 3,000 products, which will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of products are "sweep-friendly" - something that younger shoppers are increasingly pushing for.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller quantities of food bought daily from local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to entice people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are starting to look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food items from the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since buying both of these chains two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument over how to split the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering a wide range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brand names is designed to meet every need and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a commanding beauty destination challenging the old fashioned way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away 'in a rage' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled her out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furiously by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source says Jones was "angry" when TV's golden girl announced at a tense meeting at her business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new ventures - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune, according to insiders.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says: "Truly was Holly's biggest priority by far.
would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw absolutely stunned all involved.
Taserday, nobody could believe what was happening, it was so close to the launch.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning host, one of Britain's biggest money-making stars, could cost the firm millions, because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to cleaning and home furnishings, and the possibility that its launch might encounter even more delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.

"And then we fell in love"
He mocked the criticism he was about to receive from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "news reader" voice.
"I didn't give up anything".
He mentioned Kim's interest in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.

North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership summit in Singapore, that the North does not see a "consistent response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.

Trump made a much more optimistic comment in his rally speech.
"We're making excellent progress with North Korea", he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
would have killed millions.
"Since then, we have this wonderful relationship".
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people just standing there", said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tibet and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killed hundredsTibet and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non - governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.

In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult,' said Ms Sumbung.



while tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
Palu's apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a core of his election campaign and has spent lavishly on roads and railways.

Mr. Joko is also facing the pressures of mounting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.

Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported for Sturridge as he was about 30 yards out of Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He tipped the ball to the left before kicking far into the goalpost.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it floated to the top right corner of the net.

It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked".
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper returned to Mateo Kovacic with a backhand kick in that playing space before he scored near midfield and scored in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic was quick in the midfield receiving and giving.

Cromwell's Parliament Statute is the latest commemorative hit with  rewriting history controversy
his banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so much of England's cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr. Crick's proposal as simplicity and an attempt to rewrite history .
It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminsterwould become a target.
The Cromwellian picture-taking of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out.
nce the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case of course the monarchy.

t is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and that Cromwellis an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.

Killer Pig Slaying Chinese Farmer             
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
Yuan, was found dead with a torn skull covered in blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.

The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to a neighboring pigsty open.
said there was a big boar in the cage with blood in his mouth.
A forensic investigation reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig bitten the farmer to death.
My cousin's legs were bloodied and torn, said the cousin, who was called Wu on his last name, quoted the Guiyang Evening News.


The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.


In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had a Welsh farmer pinned to his tractor until his wife had scared the animal away.

Rosa Monday will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching drought will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Local rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, waste runoff, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will produce localised rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Kits floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the distributed nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep gorges to hit wild rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth fish beds.
It will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.

October may see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This can sometimes lead to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central US.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to rise and expand.

New York City may reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance for above average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watching the Brett Kavanaugh trial


Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drinking and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company has counted average viewerships on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.

Nielsen finds it sometimes hard to measure people who are looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office  issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS Friday morning where protesters were yelling at him as he tried to take a lift to the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down as CNN imagined him being cursed.
I'm standing right here in front of you said one woman.
Crees he's telling the country the truth?
Tu es puissant, beaucoup de femmes sont puissantes
Flake said his office had issued a statement and went to the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate by a single vote.
Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.

After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The coroner's office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for their  diligence and pursuit of justice.

Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "battered and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", said Wayde.

A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police, have been pounding themselves with eggs and throwing powdery paint which has caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
A brawl also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their batons to keep the brawl under control.

14 people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the pro-independence regionone year after the referendum of 1 October was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but turnout was low, with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.

The protest continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
Ngota ya, re na le nako e monate.
He said, "I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck".
Despite a vital but nail-scratching victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in pre-trial detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
It's getting more and more tense, he said.

Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livigston's promotion stunned Rangers by moving Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference as Gary Holt's team moved into second along with Hibernian.

Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League until Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile is extending their undefeated run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still without a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead long before they scored a goal, with their breaststroke bringing Rangers all kinds of trouble.
SR broke through, but rolled in front of the goal, then AL could only play wide after he came closer and met CH's head across the goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could get the visitors with deadly moments.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining hands to give Menga a shot and score from the middle of the frame.

That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a rebound from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow ticked wide to avoid yet another open game from Livingston.

Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Till the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward track.
Their style of play and manning have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top flight, but much credit goes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defensive lineup as Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they did in times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and they only managed to pass the home team once, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle division.

There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a falling out on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.

The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 BST near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
Metropolitan Police said officers are working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus diversions are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.

The riot broke out at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Tornado guards were called in to handle the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was confined to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said:Special trained prison staff have been deployed to investigate an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.

We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may stay behind bars longer.
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the prison's chief executive was receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officers were called in to address serious disorder involving personnel being attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitz Floods (Dry Areas May Benefit)
Tropical low pressure is unusual in Arizona
The National Weather Service has already issued Monday and Tuesday flash flood warnings for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to gain 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of immediate flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore losing strength.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in tropical storm strength in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Rainy day totals are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest threat expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains may cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Two teenage boysA 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered under the meanness, the rage' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about her claim.
The President said Saturday that the Americans had seen that day "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a clean record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president was referring indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican ascendancy in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing", he said.
"I'm not a fan of this.
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, hundreds dead, numbers still rising
At least 384 people died and many were washed away when huge waves broke on beaches as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.

The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Whenever the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved across the open ocean at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.


Nashkoks shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Evaluation and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's tremor was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.

Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicentre.
"Communication is completely hampered with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.

"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse", they said.


Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.



Indonesiatsunamideaths rises to over 800.
This is very bad.

They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups embark on the gruesome task of getting the disaster relief work underway, some people complained that highly experienced foreign relief workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas can only be started after the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster, " we can open it up for international aid, but it doesn't have a status yet".
As the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami dawns, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.


Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachuting team, trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.

"As a senior in the parachute weaving field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.

The driver of the car was clearing an ATM at an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.

West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the show that was canceled for "emotional reasons", said the show's producer.

"I believe 'you' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" said West earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.

The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.

Mexico's AMLO promises not to use force against civilians

Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to tame the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed at a time when leftist student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training attract youths to gangs.
The US Should Double Funding for AI
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US is short of an overall formal AI strategy.
ntr'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t'a-t
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", said Lee.
Dupling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.

Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leadership; it's the corporate ones", said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired influential individuals from other universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help support the US's AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI", he said.
China's State Council released their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.

And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire in recent months.
Macedonians vote in election or country's name should be changed

Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim to the territory and has refused them admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has sown doubts as to whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece".

"Nau, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-

The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of any irregularities as of 1 p.m.

"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's MEP, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.

"If they don't want to take us for Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
Less than the required amount. A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote yes.

A setback in the referendum would be the first serious setback for the policies of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through the whole Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared out the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his 65th minute goal.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a midfield kick at the start of the series.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal.
He then pushed a slide to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Tú sabes que yo soy.Tú sabes que yo soy.
"We are happy that he scored a goal at that moment".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball past the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the far corner.
Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much point in forcing another start.
t the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a promoter's pick with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
"Though we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level from any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly favorably disposed to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, had a throwing practice Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holding rallies in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican ascendancy in the midterm elections.
"Everything we did was on the line in November.
5 weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
I don't stand, but I actually stand and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they're now determined to take back power by any means possible, you see the meanness, the wit.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them".
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And one saw it over the last four days", he said, and went on to call the Democrats "evil and mean and cunning and false".
He was referring to the name of Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking member, Dianne Feinstein, who received a loud cheer from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
You leaked the document?
,,,. What?
That was really weak body language the weakest body language I've ever seen".
Workers' Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it was not exactly a surprise.
I am the last person in a string of Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for standing up boldly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, this was exactly what Friday night's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "friendlier, more favorable" politics has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.

It started soon after Jeremy became leader when colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views started expecting me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed with whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
And this isn't just my experience.

I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shrink away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of no confidence" or change in selection rules, the party gets scarier.
n the past two years, I've had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and then to be "okay".

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East could have been confused in the slightest about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who pushed the Friday motion, I can only say that with the country heading for a Brexit that will hurt all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.

38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr on top
Two late threes may have slightly skewed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
now top of the points table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I should be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Praise be to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute three, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an uncapped three.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he, just before halftime, hit a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.

There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott being carried off on a portable, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, tampered with by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an uncapped three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very tight game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for killing Climo without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty spot squeezed the ball behind the incoming Ayr loose.
Climo did so on purpose, as he also did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal kick and flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks set to take on a new career in the restaurant industry

The 56-year-old stars as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a masonry covered naval barracks in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were plastered with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It's a duty to get it back.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is as freshas the need to sail the Pacific Ocean again.

"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
After decades of sporadic negotiations Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial re-election fight next year also has much to depend on Monday's ruling.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
and that little will change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last protest shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has tapped any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold them.

Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was extremely fast.
Boliviawill have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial differences", he said.
one of Latin America's most popular presidents still using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".

Paris fashion shows reveals latest range of great head covers heading to stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or avoid the sun altogether, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of loose oversized head covers to their SS19 collection on the runway that captivated the style at Paris Fashionweek.
This summer, Instagram has been flooded with extremely impractical hats, and these designers have been parading their stunning creations on the runway.
The Valentino was a beige hat with a feathery wide rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other large accessories included jewel- adorned watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple but these were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks  just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream shark.
And if you keep up the great fashion show, this is your lucky day.
Stylists predict that the huge hats might be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats follow shortly after the heels of 'La Bomba', the two-foot-wide-brimmed straw hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A straw-beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frills and finished with a white leather handle on top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashionweek.
As the designer has made such an impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language Skills Essential to World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zipper achievements of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see global languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
"N's language is his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language scholars have achieved a higher A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as a subject, given the same status as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Jobs and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employees give for their difficulty in filling jobs, 17% are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% couldn't speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why it is so important to invest in today's children's language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.

Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the future of the country, and therefore this needs to be reflected in education.

Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire. Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.

"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to get ready at this point in my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including stops at friendly spots including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held back for his choice to fill the vacancies in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm election as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting takes place in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7pm ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live below.
Trump is likely to focus on this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week as the FBI investigates.

President Trump's campaign has thus said that these five rallies in the coming week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and could be covered by the media in Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.

Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box",said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage for the fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the four-player Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentumis a totally sedated sport concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They went six points ahead and now it's four, so we're carrying it as a little bit of momentum, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europa, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and 12 more to play.
The Americans feel, however, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal from the beak to the clearing and lead by example.
That celebratory score grew harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win Game Four completely tied with him and Thomas two behind after two rounds.
His set stool, which won the game for them at 15, was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells you that he believes the U.S. team still has a chance.
"You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game", said Spieth.
e players have all they have left now.
18 holes to print their stamp.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
Europa's single but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple to record no hits on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided hits on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this lavish crowd, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can claim a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at once or at different pits.
It is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meets with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was playing with Alex Noren.
one hold on the job and two doubles on the top nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they could barely get out of.
on Sunday, however, there's nobody to help you out of your hole.
The fours and fours are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has always been better as a team, taking a significant lead on the final day, but this four-match series also showed that the US team has the courage to fight a battle that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europa leads 10-6 during the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europa will have a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming 10-6 ahead of Saturday's four-ball and four-game series.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unevenly performing American team in the morning's four balls, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. has put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but not letting the deficit shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they played together perfectly to beat a freshman Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, has sometimes shown flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's foursomes, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always make sense on a pleasant day with a wind blowing southwest of Paris.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They scored a difficult 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 3-4 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point deficit when entering the singles, even though Furyk's team only has to play in a tie to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
After two days of second place, however, it does not look like they will be able to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will 'definitely not' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.

"We do not see a corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not be the first to unilaterally disarm".

Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
"
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader had brought to the attention of the UN earlier this week.


This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.

China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
, Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and without cease and desist until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons".

Pompeo met with Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "insane demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a rest-a-measurement course
Harvard University is offering more sleep to all its undergraduates this year in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of studying by using caffeine-fueled "all-night sessions".
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl came up to me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that nobody had told her how important sleep was - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hourlong course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this won't change student behavior immediately.

The culture of pride in 'study all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students have meant that sleep deprivationis a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough good quality sleep, he said, should be a student's "secret weapon" to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a "starvation mode", which keeps you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
he said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to apply for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to sleep as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another heartbreaking loss as Dolly Menga's goal brought Steven Gerrard's disagreeable team to a 1-0 rout.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard just his second relegation in 18 games as manager so his side were eight points behind Hearts, who had run away in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and it didn't look like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston has climbed to third, just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after Border Patrol Judge Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr to the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was using the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his nuts with the way his well-trained team smashed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes later when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal,,, but the midfielder opened his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the back of the goal.
Rangers took over, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty at the quarter-final when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots on target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a goal-kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener may have been against the direction of play at the 34th minute, nobody can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
Rangers once again failed to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact as the wing sent Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
Livingston, however, continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett packing long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim for a penalty kick when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR COUNT FOR... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a mainstay of science, and it has also become a mainstay in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
"Gosh, this is cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just  a few days before his 63rd birthday.

New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' predator cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, transformation of these cells in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it back.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
"Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "teach" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump mocking speech after his appearance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a lengthy performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
"I talk to white people so often and they're like, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago", he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star poked fun at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.

It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West by posting this.
West also complained to the audience that he was made difficult behind the scenes by what he wore on his head.
"They bullied me from behind the stage.
"Don't go out with that hat on".
They bullied me!
"Actually, I'm in a low place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the lowlands?" and said that he would "put on his Superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.
Two times his comments caused an outcry from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio went dead quiet".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhythm guitarist Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOUNTS".

"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe adopts and preaches an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free. He's free. He's free.
"We, too", she added.

He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.

A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast County District Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-waving role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.

Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strong" about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strongly about it right now - where did we go wrong with manhood?', he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
"" Because something was clearly wrong with our young men. ""

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, representing a change from the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly through parts of China through infected blood transfusions.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Much of the transmission of the diseases comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senators' data by staff, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations are being driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more abominable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety were compromised by this fraudulent and false claim - was not responsible for the leakage of this information at all.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement soon drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is evidence of anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He shouldn't be provocative.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and quiet.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to lift Waters out of the midterms, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true", he tweeted."Great if it's true", he tweeted."Great if it's true", he tweeted.
Waters stated that her office "has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are legally accountable for anything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British plot and this seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy cartoon franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and struggled further in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-the-knee self-satire on the topic of how obvious power we are to be the nation's new executive?
anyway, the awkward Johnny English with his pimples and rubber face has renewed his license to wreck everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English speaking movie audiences.
He's the ridiculous secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to sophisticated elegance has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire anthem at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.

There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English walking up to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and cutting the screwdrivers briefly from his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is showcased but the humor feels rather bland and peculiarly redundant, especially when the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now themselves use comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent movie jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perennial thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, much to the dismay of the agent on duty -a pitiful little role for Kevin Eldon.
The final straw for a Prime Minister who is a bloated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is very little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is in jeopardy, she must call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but who from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a all-star role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Then the Batman and Robin are about to completely mess up everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service completely back on duty and they come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Till then, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set a French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
Nothing is spared for that final scene, but as cute and lavish as it may be, the whole affair is rather like children's TV.
     
And like all the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, "Couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings out her talent?

Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a drastic plan that would see Britons working a four-day week - but being paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants to transfer company-wide savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day.
It will give workers a three-day week - but they will still take home the same pay.
Source says that it will "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the workers' favor.
The move to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.

A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in service companies.

He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give employees 10 percent of equity in private sector businesses, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?
He was firm, firm, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I've formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has been eager to deny it", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
" And all she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
36 years old.
I don't see anything new.
What is World Citizen's Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be hosting the World Citizen's Festival, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive lineup of stars performing with an equally impressive goal: ending poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy not only performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen's Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.

Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is this just another case of so-called "clicktivisme" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different causes.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.

The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
A UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", have pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.

In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA may use navy for "blockade" to stop Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as energy brokers just like in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he is quoted as saying.
And, according to one official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to blockade, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself to be the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost the exports of their liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoners".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US view provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the highest level of sport", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren lied about her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he "is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.

A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
58% of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% supported the idea that she should stand.
The poll showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for possible 2020 running include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump event She also mentions that Palin has PTSD at Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with one count of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injury that our soldiers are returning with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back wondering if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She says her partner, "and his violent gang boys", have abused her, but US officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.

New US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates those policies", said the friend-of-the-court legal task force.
Prosecutors further argued in the subpoena that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is damaging to the US economy and says they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June instructed immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", said Sessions in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.

Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda advertising'

Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
while it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that has led to their leveling of tariff barriers on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now escalating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, one will find at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing very limited dissenting voices and not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has turned down the offer to publish its article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh debacle, warn analysts

The emotions are very high, and most Republicans are on record as already indicating that they want to go ahead with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) 's encouragement for an FBI investigation at the drop of a hat would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November, Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be very high", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it may be higher, particularly among suburban swing-style female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don't vote often because they don't like the president".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
"It's become a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
though, after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, Americans seem slightly divided about whom to believe, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
38% thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely shook during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Flake urged the FBI to investigate the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her at age 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.

Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "global domination".
"We have to do this now", he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment"."It's a historic moment".

It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on the same browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls this "data-powered personalization".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce,a security platform bought by IBM, developers on the staff who were hired to work on the project anda community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to launch a total change where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".

Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Cross - religious celebration
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I was honoured 100 years later in his home town.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
4 days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "the greatest bravery", led the line forward before he stormed a field gun single-handedly and knocked out three of the platoon.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I know I could never do, but something that is humbling".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels honoured to be able to play a part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people".
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 but get Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching the packed Bellator 206 only to miss the main event.
San Jose's program featured 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to go head-to-head, UK viewers were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake until the early hours especially for the fight.

"It is government policy that the content at 6pm was not appropriate and so they had to switch to children's shows", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", yeah.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will be working on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
n't it was, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six as we normally do and we've tried to offer more to our fans and just go over our time.
It is an unfortunate situation".

he also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympics.

"To this day", he said, "those feelings of being less than, and feeling different, are the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says that he lied about his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others "hope".

Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference was never an issue.
He went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says her "entire perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'", he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medal".

Daley says his dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.

Mickelson is not on track and withdraws from Saturday's Ryder Cup
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Mickelson, who is playing for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was waived by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball and four-figure games.
Entirement, le 5 fois Major, il se partagera la journée entre être leader de course et travailler sur son jeu sur le banc de pratique dans l'espoir de rectifier ce qui échoue.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
And as if the track alone isn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face the reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be right tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
Probably never imagined him playing two games.
I was expecting more, but this is how things turned out and this is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk has said that his presence has contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's got a way with words, he likes to make a fool of himself, and he's a great guy to have in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed shaving crazy with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just play".
EuropaThomas Bjornknowbig advantagemay soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros, a five-point lead, but won only a nail scratch by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nail scraping", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 Friday and lead 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over till you get the dots on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our team, but we're also very aware of who is on the other side the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who is delighted with the way his players have fared on the difficult golf course, adds: "I will never get ahead of myself.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tomorrow is the individual entry that comes next, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, you're being tested to your full potential as a golfer.
e message is to get to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
"Actually, I'm not a good person.

Furyk himself was already on both sides of that great last-day turnaround, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as the loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every concealed word of it", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had talked his players into courage on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start well, as seen in Brookline, as seen in Medina.
When that momentum starts to go one way, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and sorted the men who we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and came up against Rory McIlroy in the main draw, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I picked this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it all up", said Bjorn about his singles selections.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media report.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.

The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle-hardened air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as a number of secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
It should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The disastrous F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after delivery to a shipbuilder.

Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors only half the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It has apparently reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems facing the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy's "deployable ships are running out".
The official said that the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been decommissioned, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bats' secret life
A new study is underway on a farm in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano night butterfly as well as the brown langour and Daubenton butterflies at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activity throughout the season.

Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the bat's habitat are most important and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bates are not really blind.

They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleeping-place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of the estate, says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful bat area", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
"But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the need to search for bats before maintaining properties because it is possible that the unwitting destruction of a single breeding site could mean the death of up to 400 females and cubs and an entire local population could be wiped out.
Bates are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them or to destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in and help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo completes rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.

The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel Friday reported.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that".
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They wanna be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and all is well,' the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy".
The player will be awarded "moral damages for any amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Mayorga asserts that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent"a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had the hospital take pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo, who was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, has joined Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will 'regret it forever' if its carmakers lose
UK will 'regret it forever' if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said UK Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.

We need a deal, said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant  which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis  produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has said that they will close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March could lead to disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid those checks at the border".
We need a deal. we want the best deal that will, as I say, allow us to not only enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.
Toyota did not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's plant convener, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said:We have proposed a precise and plausible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.


Rosenstein has denied the report.
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttT
A meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was instead scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set yet, it could be this week, I can see it being pushed back another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of news sessions is not due to a "dislike" for TV journalists who are "impact-obsessed", although she said: "I wouldn't argue with the fact that they are impact-obsessed".
She hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers".

We're trying to do this a lot and you've seen us do this a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States".
Trump is a regular when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a freewheeling and timely, bizarre appearance to gathered journalists.

The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and express the wish that they would stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, leading to expected decisions this autumn.

I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
I repeat how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery following head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before rest.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of just crashed there", said Reed.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He hit five home runs on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year  to help the homeless
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money helping to fund the government's plans to combat homelessness.
the surcharge that is outside the current stamp duty, including the higher levels set two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new London properties are bought by non-UK citizens which pushes up prices and makes it harder for first time buyers to get a foot in the door.
has become a "ghost town" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.

He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by hoarding land but not using it and encouraged Mrs May to waive quotas on affordable housing to repair Britain's "housing disaster".
Mr Corbyn has announced a striking series of intended housing improvements, including rent control and an end to "no-fault evictions".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.

For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness an overblown reality.
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, who are currently in third place in League One, three points below the top scorers.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team, but that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I used to watch Scotland at Hampden with my dad as a kid, and that's something that pulls me back.
"However, the opportunity can only come if I am successful in club management".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
"Its structure and facilities make it a Premier League club", he said.
It is not an easy task to get it there, but I will probably consider myself successful only if I can get the club back there.
Ross's managerial career lasted only three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Actually, it was probably a real crossroads", he says, looking back on how he took over Alloa's leash.
"I really believed the drive was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds weird because I've done enough good, made a reasonable living out of it, and experienced reasonable highs.

There are many things one has to come through weekly.
I still go through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I do, it feels the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave improved the income of Britain's struggling pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bar and pub groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July but restaurant receipts were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that Julyfollowed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when drinking establishments were down 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-led bars and bars fared better and rose more than restaurants fell.
Food-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Outlets and bars sold 6.6 percent for the month, with food laundry down 3 percent.
These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly difficult on top of ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-driven operators and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've been experiencing since August will bring much needed relief.
Total sales growth across bars and restaurants, including new locations that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's industry sales monitor for the UK's drinks, pubs and restaurants sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 industry groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.

A company that makes breast-milk products has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
To celebrate the launch of what has been called the "world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to breast-feeding mothers.
4 vraies mamans dans une grange de foin et de vaches à la mode d'une chanson qui comprend des paroles comme: "Oui, je me suce, mais tu ne vois pas ma queue" et "Au cas où tu n'aurais pas vu, ce ne sont pas des oignons, ce sont mes seins".
The chorus goes, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".

With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying that it understates the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Many poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They must conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth", wrote one.

Another commentator noted: "It's profoundly traumatic for mother and baby.
why not use it to advertise a breast pump for men who can hold their babies?
Another added: "The ad is so out of touch".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "horrible" to her.
"I think it's a genius idea." I think it's a genius idea."
would have had one if I hadn't given birth.

The ad is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genius product", wrote one.
It is a fun advertisement for mothers who are milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feeling like "cows".
It is not an advertisement praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they wean.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a big and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the milking process and all the challenges involved, while in an entertaining way, showing people how connected they can be with the wonderful feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.

Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by going ahead and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or sponsors' household members are here illegally and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
"We are continuing to pursue these individuals", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference call, rather than in person, to argue their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief would be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
advocates say that concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child's struggles are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for saying goodbye to friends may compound the trauma that many are already suffering.

According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandal ends his presidency early.

"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is he feeds you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's changing cast and daily twists in the plot (like seeking an argument with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a congressional redistricting that has now put two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
The newly changed Pittsburgh suburban district is allowing Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring to gauge his strength.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally delimited in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then backtracked
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.


The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year which was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.

Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the gathering for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.

Studying History - What is the meaning of history?
next thing that might happen might be the special hearing on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to be focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the country's attack on our elections.

There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how much the fight can be extended.
1938 German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is either hastened or slowed.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper reported that he proposed to secretly take on the president last year and speculated on whether he was qualified for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
if we track those tests,there's a long winter ahead for democracy.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistically ahead of Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.

Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear
even though survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it with their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include  a traditional long-term insurance policy,  a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance on your own ability  as long as you have the money.
Redact your legal documents: Cut legal wrangling at the pass.
Get a healthcare proxy in place so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts follow your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider also proxies for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.

Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspected in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a raid on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan to mow down pedestrians and a cyclist who were in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both those charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "good planning and foresight", said prosecutors, describing Saipov's manner of execution as "abominable, cruel and perverse".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, stated the notice of intent.

Décennie est passé depuis que le District Sud de New York a poursuivi un procès de condamnation à mort.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they are "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a plea to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", said Patton.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would "be out" by then if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.

The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amidst attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the deadlock and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to "destroy Chequers".
he proposed that Mr Farage should be made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would have been out by then,' he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but we must kick out the Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.

The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.
Tory Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters:I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we get elected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added:Prime ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr. Farge said that the rally politicians "had to feel the heat" if they were on the threshold of violating the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
It's now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell themwe won't let you get away with it
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added:I want you to feel the heat for our political class, who are about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly in the city center.
A few activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour Leader Lord Adonis has mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the one that opened the conference.
These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
It isa total wits.
There is no such thing as agood Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to look hard after running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "look forward to running for president" following the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton claims world title after team rules gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel

From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first, leaving Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the very back of the pack, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes drove a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free leaving the interior at risk of endurance following a double-motion to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the starting grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held onto his tyres to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the pits on lap 44, but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said to be a difficult day, because Valtteri had been doing fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two", said Hamilton.
It was just really bad body language.

The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vile and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened over the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars", he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
"Nothing happened. I didn't do it".
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?

Feinstein was sent the letter setting out the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked".

"Actually, I'm not a doctor. Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct, suggesting that the Democrats use the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the cruelty, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to outwit to get power and control", Mediaite reported the president said.

Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after beach lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific Ocean beach lake in Micronesia now says one man is missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they have not been able to account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people have been taken to a hospital.

The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the beach lake near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
Passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"This is a particularly good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
he said that the air attendants panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said crews working nearby improving a dock also helped with an inflatable lifeboat to get people back and forth to shore before the plane sank into about 100 feet [30 m] of water.

Analysts lay out a timeline of the night woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
"When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was joking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that 
"He wiped her out", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

No black person?!
NY kindergarten teacher sues couple for being fired after racist text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly-addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple deny being racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, lied about her dismay when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO, NOT A BLACK PERSON", wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message."I am a black person", wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
n't she sent it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
After discovering her flair, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, saying that their outgoing African-American nanny did a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for damages for the dismissal and is seeking damages of $350 per day for the six months, residency work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that well", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered with accusations of being racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to terminate Maurice's employment, and they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
"Nsati wanga anamtumizira mawu amene sanafune kunena.
She's not a racist. She's not a racist.
"We're not racist people", man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Here's a question for you: Would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
"Okay, here we go".
Plasco likened the case to extortion and said that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like this?
It's not a very nice thing to do,' the investment banker added.

A new letter reveals Paddington publishers feared a talking bear wouldn't connect readers

When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called to say that it was awful, that they didn't expect her to make it", said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Nad called me and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should have said hello.
And I did.
"Tashi, I love you so much, lamb heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly running out and leaving her system.
She died a while ago and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was gonna unfold.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
"Memories" is a phrase that means "I really had to keep it together".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was by then grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew", she said.
"Available, I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a tremendous sense of empathy for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".

miss davis designed the cards "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.

Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling sick or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He hit his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them".
She said that his death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It tore a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI investigation begins
I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for -a timeless investigation that has no scope -we might be able to bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan buildup.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
their objection is all about timing.

George W. Bush is calling senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.

The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet, saying that there were 1,127 floods last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.



Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first, said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysteria, says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.

I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they would sayhysteria, said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against himaridiculous and coordinated character assassination, organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats, she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the House.
I'll say this
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as it is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say,"isn't that great?" said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a just diatribe, months and years of anger overboiling, and she can't get it out without crying.
We cry when we get angry, Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do you?
I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to,You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad.
And then she just went on.
"Okay, I thought it was brilliant".

One of my most vivid memories of working in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying in nameless rage and being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an older woman - a cold driver whom I was a little afraid of - who dragged me down a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
Its don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because they've had an effect on you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
1987,when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races,Miss Schroeder,very frustrated,realized that there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea of running for president.
I didn't think it through, she told me laughingly 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
nce it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finds collected, so she  made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million dollars.
It had been a lost battle.
She discovered that from her supporters who gave men $1,000, she would only get $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my headstone?
"She cried"" She cried"" She cried""
How the US-China trade war might be good for Beijing

Donald Trump,
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion) items and effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods each time, recently slapping tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.

Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US trade war pressures on the long term could positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could start an economic twilight in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously admitted, said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security,a thinker.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war for over seven years.

Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to restore normalcy to areas destroyed by terrorists.

The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country are in need of philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.

Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.

The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 to 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"Actually, I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch to fellow countryman John Ram who on Sunday defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that guy, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.

Team USA has been struggling all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who have been playing high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
After a disappointing performance, Captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team: I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
t had been time this morning when we set some heat on Europa.
We've deleted.
Thomas, take your hats off.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat tilted.
We're outmatched.
